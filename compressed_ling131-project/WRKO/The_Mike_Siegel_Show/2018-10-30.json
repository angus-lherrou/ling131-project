[noise]\nOn one thing is\nOn and on I mean that this self taught that Trump was a global is the Trump self identify as as a nationalist he says Trump is it at the um [noise] you know it basically working against\nAh\nEverything that that that people think of a mad that I don't know I just I don't really ridiculous I I Can't justify in any way with the media\nWhile it's or what but what happens is about it I mean do the does it stay do people believe it and you know there's some believe that there is some effect on on losing votes for Republicans now because the media is in this in this monopolistic a deterioration of the truth\nKnow what's what's happening is they're increasing now we're now we're back to my sweet spot the electorate there's an increasing number of people are voters who are writing off the media as being absurd they're writing them off as being totally biased that they don't take them seriously\nSo instead of helping their argument helping their case against Trump it's actually hurting them it's just like the Brett Kavanaugh hearing\nI told you I think when I was on the air with you one week they were losing twenty thousand voters per week and then at the FBI week the week that the FBI got involved\nThe Democrats are losing twenty five thousand a boat or a day\nSo you know they're they're losing it they don't even know they're losing if they don't know how far out of touch they are with the American people and they don't realize the American people make up their own mind based on their than their common fan and their sense of the fact and um so it doesn't have an effect\nThis is not going to in any way I heard Trump if anything all the event of the last month of various surprises we face as a nation or all working in it toward the red wave that I predicted last December when people are talking about a blue wave that didn't exist\nLet me turn to the truth\nI could almost punch the walls are although they're not padded so I wouldn't do or maybe they should be padded with my mental state right now\nBut uh [laughter] the um uh the the reality is for example\nA cause you know at at the public meetings sitting right near Louis Farrakhan calypso Louis who's a neo Nazi right here in simple he's a Nazi nothing less than that uh hates Jews got her religion Jews are the worst white people are too but she was particularly\nUh at the same meeting new is Al Sharpton or Bill Clinton sits a few feet away from him\nI'm burning the anti Semite anti Semitic Jew Sanders and they use it they ... what we call a self hating Jew and the Jewish religion\nUm he uh hired Linder source or he personally does the heat the grades Israeli makes excuses for the Palestinians all the time\nHires Linda source or as an advisor she's the most virulent hateful individual when it comes to being ... hot as supporting has blond Hamas wanting to destroy and and the liquid they state of Israel\nAt all cost cheers the Palestinian bombers who are homicide bombers killing Jews\nAlways speaks out for them\nAnd Bernie higher and higher\nSo how did these left wing Democrats get away with that\nAnd by the way George Soros another left wing contributor while we've already talked about his being appear neo Nazi because of his Nazi sympathies in World War two\nSo how do we how do they get away with it and nobody talks about them at all but they talk about Donald Trump has done nothing but number one uh recognizing the state of Israel's\nCapital embassy as being Jerusalem and number two getting rid of the money to the United nations Palestinian program\nA number three getting rid of the Palestinian mission or that that no longer exists and um and and taking all of that away and taking the money away from the Palestinian walk motor boss of the Palestinian authority where they were paying homicide bombers for killing Jews\nExplained to me how it's convoluted the other way\nVery difficult to explain because it's not based in fact you know for example Lewis barracks on recently that I won't even repeat it because then so turned off by what he said very anti Semitic statement just real recently\nOr this and that case in Pittsburgh who uh unfortunately tragically killed those Jewish people out of worship service\nAnd that I could have been triggered by Louis Farrakhan a previous statements recent statements that were anti thematic and and I again I Will not even repeat them I think they're so horrible\nAnd that so how he can or paid the media can try to turn on Trump said he was put off but hard I don't really ridiculous\nI think the people are just at one point of view and that is that they need to get rid of Trump say anything on the bowl do anything on the ball and the whole summer that\nThe negative thinking and talking at [noise] you know stick stonewall but it's not it's not working and that I think most Americans know uh who would be anti semantic folks are out there\nWill come right back and pick that up and get into the campaigns what's going on there and then your views as you know might be as as somewhat at odds with the um mainstream pretty slow to speak which not surprising we'll be right back with Dr

...\nOkay so that's I mean that's that's kind of a suite of the up in the states isn't it\nYeah yeah well don't forget the ah from carried that state fifty seven thirty eight or span against Hillary I mean if if the Trump spate start\nYou know I Know I understand that but I'm Talking about right across the board all the states that were democratic incumbents Democrats or or the incumbents are losing that shouldn't the Democrats look at that and and and be as an indicator that something's wrong in the party\nWell that's why they're going nuts over everything trying to find some way to get Trump and and the people who support Trump by the way or another little good news item aren't break and I look at my numbers\nAnd that is we I don't think we mentioned a Michigan but James right now is all yeah striking is that the he's behind in my forecast model but he's within striking distance of Stabenow and if he yeah there that's a big one\nYeah he um actually he's picked up he was way behind previous way behind what he's very or to you know he's very articulate he's been done some media appearances\nAnd he's a very very strong or not by any means radical I'm very very mainstream conservative I Would call\nYeah I think that's fair to say right now my forecast models shows him losing next week by two percent but that's within striking distance but taking it because he's going right to the people and trying to convince blacks and others the border\nAnd he's ... he's turning the tide because I Would say a he has picked up by about Thirteen percentage point than my forecast a within the last two months\nWell if he if he does in the last week with the president did in the last week really for his whole campaign but certainly the last week the president turned up the heat and intensity on his appearances all over the place if this is a young man can turn up the heat in Michigan\nAnd a get out there all over the place I think he's going to turn it around but I think there's still time to do that\nRight well he'll be helping number fifty nine and um and uh he may help push towards a higher into my range fifty eight to pick the\nRight well All right so from there one which is wonderful news ah from there we get to by the way um what about Alabama a no the fellow who beat the\nUh the the Republican a legit pedophile um what about what about that race because he was only in there as an appointment as I understand that and he had the ...\nOh let's see how are they doing right at the mall\nAnd maybe it maybe two years from now or maybe now I forget which might argue it's\nNot it's a there are no Alabama Senate race\nBut okay so then he's two years from now but you know what I'm trying to get to is that\nHe realizes what his state is he realizes Roy Moore a was I mean any good good Republican and conservative is kind of ... what a beat him though at that time when you had a guy there who was who was a wacko yeah I'm so in a campaign\nNo he didn't and then they blemish them with all of that the pedophile business so I'm what I'm saying is that now this fellow could be a a an add on to the Republicans on many votes because he's going to be more concerned about his constituents than he is about the Chuck Schumer for example\n[noise] mhm so ... if you get fifty nine that might be in some cases sixty ... that that would be or not it this year though\nWould be would it would start in January yeah but no I mean in January you'll still be a Democrat but he might vacate the Democratic caucus\nSo in order to go along with the Republicans the way mansion has done some times\nPrecisely because the people of Alabama can you imagine if something comes up on a conservative Supreme Court nominee madam Justice Ginsburg retires can you imagine a the intensity of the phone calls he's going to get from his constituents in Alabama to stick with the president\nAt the end to well that doesn't matter in that case anymore because the filibuster doesn't matter on Supreme Court votes but on on a bill that would be important\nUm this guy could go along with the Republicans wind up being the sixty a vote or is it to to get cloture on filibustering yes that's my only point\nA cause Alabama people would pressure now let's get to the house\nBy house and\nThe real [laughter] that's a big ah a big biggest thing\nI Know what's going on there\nIt's a mess but let me let's start 'em let me just start very specifically California has six seats\nThat are important and that could go either way I think there are life is retiring and you have forty five Republicans retiring by the way which means you have\nBasically unknowns on both sides and in fact I Want to say I know what I mean not in Congress previously so how harmful was that the Republicans at forty five of them have gone with the wind\nWell uh let me take a look at California here my left so I have a say one two three\nFour losses for the Democrats in California or ... feet by Lou\nHow does that mean then that lawsuit for in the total state yeah okay 'cause they have a but there are six that's\nJust on the on the Democratic side\nSo it's not that bad it's just that Democrat\nYeah but how many Republican members of Congress or in and and California and the house\nA total ... I'm Out in front of me\nYeah I don't I don't let's say and then I also have I Want to point out let's see okay one two three four five six Democrats that may lose their state\nSo we could have up to ten Democrats than they are in California actually uh gone\nSo if for gun for sure on your analysis right and and maybe six more let's say three this this split in half\nThat's all you had to have you heard of a minus seven for Democrats ... realistically in the house correct\nYes so\nLet me see oh\nI've got my numbers in so many places there's so many things that you have to track\nWhat oh no question but the the the the point I'll make to the audience is a California is hugely important\nBy just by I think like point to\nTo Greece so fast I mean it barely\nBarely even measurable amount\nOf um\nYou know change and global temperatures so\nPirate attacks especially in a state now as small as Washington August washed fairly Oculus but it would have even less than that but there there were roughly I mean literally you could actually impact it would be so small\nAre so big and be irrelevant then there's um\nThe American Enterprise Institute I'm going through this because the left doesn't like facts and data and documents they like to just make hyperbole and the statements with no basis in reality often times and that's why I'm going through a point by point it was scientists American and the prices to Benjamin ... says this\nThat the carbon tax proposal is what he called naive\nAnd quote virtually all of the assertions and supportive its proposal already correct or implausible the plan is poor conceptually and deeply an serious and quote now I bring that up because it goes to the larger question of climate change period and global warming\nOr the heartland this to your organization put out I think it's about eight hundred page document I have it here\nUh it's my Bible on the subject and I'm sure you're familiar with the the ... the nine and a governmental panel on climate change in other words the un has its governmental panel on climate change and you did it without government intervention with scientists\nAnd the one real into that climate shows reconsidered\nYeah so if you if you ... it's a it's a big book um\nThere there's I had a there's actually a few items that or five actually\nWell I have one by all I Need is the one I mean it's [laughter] it's it's it's replete with with several hundred scientists who do not get the December to so oh well good because while the the the point is the scientists or who\nWill point out that we don't have a a crisis or a problem with global warming or climate change caused by human beings they don't get the chance to say so on in the Washington Post the New York times or\nOn CNN or NBC CBS ABC CNBC MSNBC\nBecause they won't let them on the air or in their print\nSo uh even people like yourself for example so what what would your compendium the one that I have any way did it I'm sure the others as well as to lay out actual data\nFor example uh since we're getting into it uh I remember reading and your compendium of that or they were doing at temperatures around the world\nAnd using thermometers a different locations to try to get a job and and the average temperature for the globe that's how they ... they would measure\nOne of them was that it was at Heathrow Airport\nIn London or were they had the thermometer but it was at the end of the airport where the jets take off the other way and you have this fiery exhaust coming out\nOf the exhaust system of jet airplane that obviously heats up dramatically nobody's going to you if you were behind that you burn up to death and they've got these monitors close behind their so obviously the temperature is going to be artificially higher because of that and\nThen there was another one near an incinerator which was burning incentive rating the trash rubbish\nAnd that temperature was increased because of that this was not natural this was chosen as locations were higher temperatures would be to try to prove a point by using false premises of going to locations that were automatically going to have higher temperatures the recollect any of that\nYeah ah so I mean just a city is in general are are just water um there's there's just more people and you know a lot of things going on so uh\nYeah I find it but if you put it to monitor by of by an incinerator where you put it in for mom and her at the back end of a jet airplanes taking off what they expect who's going to happen\nExactly so a lot of these their place in areas um\nI don't know if it's purposely or not that artificially\nHigh um [noise] artificially hire a you know because like it where where they are placed themselves they're not sort of a\nCanceled out by uh you know or their temperature readings stations that are you know we're all\nGetting sort of distorted picture of what the actual temperatures are\nSo yeah that's that's another that's one point with with\nAll those temperature mouse studies and like half based\nOn yeah and in other words like eight I was I'm what I'm going to suggest as they're not honest I mean I'm a ... that the professor Jones who was at a University of East Anglia he was running the program\nFor the un on the inner governmental panel on climate change and his his order was uh to find that global warming and climate change problems that we have to fix because of human beings\nAnd so when he got emails from scientists such as yourself for example\nWho would send him data showing that human beings we're not causing global warming of the problem wasn't as as was being described because they're models never work if people want to check that out he would he would delete those emails and he was caught\nA Phil Jones Dr phil Jones and um he he claimed nearly committed suicide and the end because he was as sewed compromised in his intellectual um academia by by being political instead of a scientist and then he retired and he's gone but um I mean that\nThat was called climate gate that whole situation was called Climategate whatever came of that\nUh nothing really uh you know at ten cents right [laughter] I mean it's\nJust a I mean that happened\nYou know it was covered fairly centrally by conservative politicians but they don't have the sort of\nA poll that you know the mainstream outlets do and uh it's just something that all of them they've already reached that conclusion\n'em and they're basically they're just going to try to make the data fit the conclusion something I'm sure they can ... it's going to be\nA you know ignored or explained away or you know right at all\nRight and that that by the way a give me an example of the opposite of different fields ...\nUniversity of Florida State university a big gun control advocate but he did a study a and he was he he said I'm a left wing or I'm with people for the American way and all that but he found in the study that people owning firearms honest people owning firearms actually deters crime\nHe he was willing to put aside is owned by I think I remember that national yeah and and and it's a different field but it's the point scientists need to look in ... you don't come to the conclusion first\nAnd then find data to a full year conclusion anyway I'm this whole field has been faster dies if you will and it's unfortunate and uh fortunately people like he was still they're battling just offensive thank you very much great study we appreciate your time on the program\nThat you really have a

UCLA eighty to Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nEverything that that that people think of a mad that I don't know I just I don't really ridiculous I Can't justify in any way with the media\nWhile it's or what but what happens about it I mean do the does it stay do people believe it and you know there's some believe that there's some effect on on losing votes for Republicans because the media is in this in this monopolistic a deterioration of the truth\nNow what's what's happening is they're increasing now we're now we're back to my sweet spot the electorate\nThere's an increasing number of people are voters who are writing off the media as being absurd that writing them off as being so totally biased that they don't take them seriously so instead of helping their argument helping their case against Trump it's actually hurting them\nIt's just like the Brett Kavanaugh herring\nI told you I think when I was on the air with you one week they were losing twenty thousand voters per week and then at the FBI wait the week that the FBI got involved the Democrats are losing twenty five thousand\nA boat or a day\nSo you know they they're losing it and they don't even know they're losing it they don't know how far out of touch they are with the American people and they don't realize the American people make up their own mind\nBased on their sense their common fan\nAnd their sense of the fact and um so it doesn't have an effect this is not going to in any way I heard Trump if anything all the events of the last month of various surprise us we face as a nation\nOr all working in at toward the red wave that I predicted last December when people were talking about a blue wave that didn't exist\nLet me turn to\nI could almost punch the walls are although they're not padded so I wouldn't do or maybe they should be petted with my mental state right now but I'm the I'm a the the reality\nA cozy it up at a public meetings sitting right in their Louis Farrakhan calypso Louis who's a neo Nazi\nRight here in simple he's a Nazi nothing less than that uh hates Jews gonna religion Jews are the worst wall white people are too which is particularly uh\nAt the same meeting new is Al Sharpton or Bill Clinton sits a few feet away from him I'm a burning the anti Semite anti Semitic Jew Sanders and he is if they ... what we call a self hating Jew and the Jewish religion um he a\nHigher Linder source or he personally does the heat the grades Israeli makes excuses for the Palestinians all the time\nHires Linda source or as an advisor she's the most virulent hateful individual when it comes to being a slum at your hot as supporting Hezbollah and Hamas wanting to destroy and and uh the liquid they state of Israel\nAt all cost cheers the Palestinian bombers who are homicide bombers killing Jews always speaks out for them\nAnd Bernie higher and higher so how did these left wing Democrats get away with that\nAnd by the way George Soros another left wing contributor while we've already talked about his being appear neo Nazi\nBecause of his Nazi sympathies in World War two so how do we ah how do they get away with it and nobody talks about them at all but they talk about Donald Trump has done nothing but number one\nUh recognizing the state of Israel's capital embassy is being Jerusalem and number two getting rid of the money to the United nations Palestinian program\nA number three getting rid of the Palestinian mission or that that no longer exists and um and and taking all of that away and taking the money away from the Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian authority\nWhere they were paying homicide bombers for killing Jews explained to me how it's convoluted the other way\nVery difficult to explain because it's not based in fact you know for example Lewis barracks on recently that I won't even repeated picket fence so turned off by what he said very anti the medic aid but just real recently\nOr this and that case in Pittsburgh who uh unfortunately and tragically\nKilled those Jewish people to worship service and that I could have been triggered by Louis Farrakhan a previous statements recent statements that were anti thematic and and I again I Will not even repeat them I think they're so horrible\nAnd that so how he can or Spain the media can try to turn on Trump said he was but it causes I don't really ridiculous\nI think these people are just at one point of view and that is that they need to get rid of Trump say anything on the bowl do anything on the ball and the whole\nSummer that the negative thinking and talking at [noise] you know stick stonewall but it's not it's not working and that I think most Americans know ah who be anti semantic folks are out there [noise]\nWe'll come

I mean any good good Republican and conservative is kind of ... what a beat him though at that time when you had a guy there who was who was a wacko yeah I'm so in a campaign\nNo he didn't have any and then they blemish them with all of that the pedophile business so I'm what I'm saying is that now this fellow could be a a an add on to the Republicans on many votes because he's going to be more concerned about his constituents than he is about the Chuck Schumer for example\nSo if you get fifty nine that might be in some cases sixty ...\nThat would be or not it this year though\nThey would it would start in January yeah but no I mean in January you'll still be a Democrat but he might vacate the Democratic caucus in order to go along with the Republicans the way mansion has done sometimes\nPrecisely because the people of Alabama can you imagine if if something comes up on a conservative Supreme Court nominees madam Justice Ginsburg retires can you imagine a the intensity of the phone calls he's going to get from his constituents in Alabama to stick with the president\nAt the end as well that doesn't matter in that case anymore because the filibuster doesn't matter on Supreme Court votes but on on a bill that would be important um and then this guy could go along with the Republicans on wind up being the sixty a vote or as a thing to get cloture on filibustering yes that's my only point\nA cause Alabama people would pressure now let's get to the house\nHouse and there was a real [laughter] that's a a a fake a big biggest thing I Know what's going on there\nIt's a mess but let me let's start 'em let me just start very specifically California has six seats\nThat are important and that could go either way I think there are life is retiring\nAnd you have forty five Republicans retiring by the way which means you have\nBasically unknowns on both sides and in fact I Want to say I know what I mean not in Congress previously\nSo how harmful as Republicans at forty five of them have gone with the wind\nWell let me take a look at California here my left so I have a say one two three\nFour losses for the Democrat from California or ... faith played Lou\nHow does that mean that net loss of four in the total state\nOkay 'cause they have a but there are six that's\nBased on their on the Democratic side\nSo it's it's bad it's just that Democrat\nYeah but how many Republican members of Congress or in and and California and the house\nA total ... I'm Out in front of me\nYeah I don't I don't let's say and then I also have I Want to point out let's say okay one two three four five six Democrats that may lose their state\nSo we could have up to ten Democrats than they are in California actually uh gone\nSo if for a gun for sure on your analysis\nRight and and mainly six more let's say three this this split in half or so have you heard of a minus seven for Democrats realistically in the house correct\nYes so let me see oh I've got my numbers in so many places if there's so many things that you have to track\nAnd what it was no question but the the the the point I'm up to the audience is that California is hugely important oh it is so openly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "30"}
