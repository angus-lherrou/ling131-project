M. A. S. or a very large percentage of of a physician's and we're and we're all engage in some ... primary care this this family physicians who did this\nAll right so that that's a large number a do most of your members agree with you on U.S policy\nLet's put it this way in order to pass this resolution that we had to have a majority of our Congress delegate which means we ate at a Seventy five percent of approval rate and we were able to get that\nSort of ... percent of the total membership of the total members out to vote\nIs Seventy five percent of the Congress Adele gets in each state and each group is two members of representing them so I Can't tell you that good percentage of the group a greeter disagrees with the staff but however the the Congress which represents their constituents within the organization of grade\nAs you know lately having a lot of conversation about members of the Senate who might vote one way or the other might have voted one way or the other on judge Kavanaugh um based on their\nConstituents is it fair to say\nThat the people who supported the more than Seventy five percent of your delegates who supported this resolution this so knowing they had the support of the vast majority of their own constituents in the wrong state\nI Would assume that that is correct to stay on it\nAnd I I only ask because ... sometimes look I mean we've seen uh some of the unions\nSupport and and I'm I'm not asking you to get politically I'm just making an analogy to a union leadership oftentimes supports Democrats but they themselves acknowledged that in recent years many union members vote Republican so uh that's why I'm asking whether you have the underlying support of the doctors in your group\nWell the reason why I think he was able to reach such a super majority within our group is because one thing we were very specific of posture respect every physician's ability to make their own decision and whether they agree or disagree with\nWith whether they feel comfortable with medical aid and die and if they feel comfortable that we're in a resolution of basically states that we don't want anyone to feel obligated but it should be an option available to someone who does ... does feel comfortable having that relationship with their patients\nAnd if they don't they're welcome to refer there was someone else who does so we didn't want someone to feel uncomfortable and have their own moral here's\nI'm getting a way of taking care of patients which is why I think we were able to get the approval Seventy five percent of the of the Congress delegate\n... is probably more than that actually\nWhat do you anticipate or do you anticipate the AMA looking at this and maybe changing its view\nWell that one part of this resolution that we passed was that we are going to bring a resolution to pay a to try to have them take the same there [noise]\nSo you're going to actually send them a resolution from Europe or interest group at the

that's not the case many children who didn't wind up with leukemia are cured am I correct about that\nAbsolutely and we hope a better screening and better screening process seizing but as treatment progress is that we can cure it really I mean that would be that we were up there all my goal\nAnd that we have the right and I think right now that's not the case\nWell we have the genetic code which may be even down the road will help us with Alzheimer's or dementia or a Parkinson's or I mean that that's going to happen at some point maybe not you were in my lifetime but it will absolutely given that I'll just be the devil's advocate here to her why should we let anyone\nEver be assisted with committed taking their own life\nWhen tomorrow next week next month or next year or whatever it is condition they have could be cured and we may be able to keep them alive long enough to deal with that why should we why should we help them and the life that might be a viable for many years because of scientific research\nLike we live in a world where they won't get to make their own choice that's a beautiful country be freedom of choice I people who were well in in ... to your comment of colon cancer who have called catch and pass away from calling catcher\nThey could've found it easily could have even cured it early on we saw the sign of it with some of their symptoms rectal bleeding abdominal pain\nAnd they chose not to do more to work they chose when they found the diagnostic diagnosis\nNot to go through a treatment for whatever reason they had and that's their own personal reason and one of the things that are with that we as a big problem is it over the line from with the medical system in the U. S. nowadays is a lot of times worried about population out which is wonderful but we sometimes lose the patient and the patients freedom to make their own decision and how they're being cared for\nSo you're right we may have a cure for something down the road but right now we may not for the patient may not want it so we always have to have all available solution is valuable\nFor our patients so that they they don't have to pigeonhole themselves into one thing or fit into a category someone else tells them what to do\nAs you well know when it comes to issues of life and death that's about as serious as we can get that with respect to freedom of speech freedom of choice\nThere are those who I Believe in the Catholic Church uh as as opposed to suicide that you'd get into heaven if you commit suicide in the Catholic Church has a huge popular\nThey shouldn't a New York as you well know ... a a though and I'm sure in an orthodox Judaism is the same here I'm I'm not sure about this law may be and then then fundamental apartment at the same\nThe same time we're supposed to separate church and state\nOr not but the the issue is going to become that those groups have an influence to some degree\nIt realistically if they do but from a personal perspective if someone's choosing make a decision that is if if they're coming to make that this decision they have to come to terms with their own religion and their own belief system\nSo it still remains a personal choice\nI fair enough and and listen I personally happen to agree with that but the problem I have is that sometimes the person will feel despondent at a given point and ah and then want to end it\nAnd then maybe a week or two or three later maybe they'd feel differently so how do you monitor this because I think in Oregon and Washington and one of the things that happens is that one one physician\nCan help somebody commit suicide there are specific procedures by which they are allowed to intervene even in those states where a physician assisted suicide is allowed and I think Washington Oregon or two of those states so and\nAnd they're ... they're definitely wouldn't be safeguards and the fact that you know again now this isn't part of our Lucia per se but it was part of our discussion that\nYou know the ... obviously they have to have some boundaries and guidelines along with his meaning that it wouldn't have to be it wouldn't be allowed to be one physicians a decision with the patient it should be a decision with the patient as well as another physician concurring that the terminal diagnosis is less is a certain time period that they are having pain and suffering\nUm so it wouldn't be disturbed to one physician with one patient the ones that's on page would have to have some type of review of somewhere else and independent related to agree that this is a terminal illness is no chance of getting better in addition you mentioned they may feel one way one week and then they'll say wait another week they feel differently member edge\nDecision is giving the means to the patient with a patient and making the ultimate decision\nRight but it's what the ah you just made the point or is that the you know something or you can happen uh that that might alter the circumstance and then it might not a true\nYou never know what are you sure of it you never know what the future you know old they and they\nThey may feel wonderful tomorrow or they may not they may feel worse they're making a decision with the information they have their hand at that point in time\nAnd so uh you know and obviously we can't stop people from taking their own lives they're gonna do it if they're going to do it I'm I'm sure you've heard these stories I Know someone I won't get into detail as to who\nA boa loving parent of a ... wife and her husband a loving home and\nThey went on their anniversary to another city just to spend the last few days are celebrating the ... anniversary and they got a phone call that they're Twenty one year old son who just graduated from college with honors was going to go on to have a great career\nI'm a very loving young man a wound up in the end of the blue taking his own life um\nIs that the same since you sell the health insurance is is the individual is if an individual walks into my health insurance from you Mr Wilson and we'll send us with us from Wilson and associates what would you say to them can you get them a reasonable policy\nWell you know ... ... ... is a traditional\nAny major medical plan is going to be like that so you have you know the same way with Blue Cross Blue Cross or anthem and better those carriers there all the same some of them are are on on the exchange or my care subsidy from the government many people do so that's option number one\nThe other options that are out there that that that there are becoming very popular okay\nOr their ... and you have to be creative okay we thought we talked earlier but for the break about a short term plan which is\nA twelve ... planets underwritten\nNPR sided everything else but under it that's out there so if you're healthy you can go twelve months but yet be careful if you've got to buy a short term plan\nYou know you're not by like December first the December first though if you do get back\nAfter twelve months they won't really know what's the FBI to qualify for Obamacare the next you know throwing her up at all but the following\nRight it's only it's only it's only on the plane but I mean I'm trying to get to a fundamental point here here's the question somebody walks into your office a couple that want to buy health insurance as a married couple months or a single person\nAnd then they walk in their in their forties or fifties those same between forty five and fifty five years old what kind of policy can you give that individual whether a single person or a married couple\nWell at least I'm going to get your first option which is your regular Obamacare is that there are you in the short term plan that started option is try and create of it it it you know the faith based Christian ministries are out there right now\nThere there there there are viable option there there are a little different because there are ... are not ensure they watch appeal pulling their money together\nTo share medical bills which\nIs a concept of becoming a very strong I Would probably wrapped around some kind of cats for policy or something to go with it but there's ways they way they get around it but it's not for everybody you know you have to do that there's a lot of caviar then they're up to these alternative type products but there there is African savings or if they were\nWhy you know I I have somebody very close to me has one of those a ministry plans and and the right to work that way and they covered ah who the person had a fractured hip fracture femur and wound up in the hospital for a weekend in rehab for a week\nAnd they covered both of those now they don't cover the rehab after leaving the hospital or the rehab right and you know the the weekly visit but they covered the major stay a and and so and they did it when people sharing their funds that they pay every month and the people in ministry and the plan decide how to\nHow to send the money but the money goes directly to uh people who had actual medical problems\nAnd uh it is an option but right so are you telling me then that have been a single person can't want him to run for them then get let's say Blue Cross Blue Shield or no or United healthcare is is that aren't available to them\nWell I mean ... ... ... well Blue Cross Blue Shield is is is it Obamacare play like we talked so you know you can get your if your company Blue Cross Blue Shield it's gonna be an Obamacare player without\nWithout ins or if you're a couple if you're a couple age fifty five and fifty a husband and wife are you still have to get pregnancy insurance right yes\nI used to love the ... and and they and they still\nTo pay for contraception correct correct yeah\nAnd they still wants to pay for psychological therapy even though you've been mentally healthy your whole lives together\nSo I have an electric\nAlternative type ... like like we just like you were just ... yeah\nOkay so so in other words the major insurance companies are only offering Obamacare plans they're not offering individual plans and the only option you have\nIs either the ministry plan or the uh uh other twelve months plan\nRight because in any other planet illegal\nOr what we have three minutes left\nWhat should we do to change all this\nWell you know the only way it is a shifting culture ... one of the big changes you're staying in healthcare now and it's not being done by Congress is being done by the doctors direct primary care\nDoctors out there now where you get a monthly fee to them on a bus or fifty bucks a month\nAnd you get on their primary care doc that that doesn't cover your catastrophic that cover your your X rays and hear MRIs and your and your and your actual health care so\nThat will bring costs down eventually they have no way to come back like if they strike catastrophic plan where they direct primary care prescription problem style\nI wouldn't but now you're All right I understand you're talking about a concierge service right\nI put the concierge service um is really only for the doctor isn't it\nYeah you're right that's what I thought that you have to get caught with a catastrophic plan to a hospital plan to go with it but right that's a start you\nKnow so where do you get the kind of what do you get the catastrophic plan\nRight well right now your cat right now right now we have to get that like I said at the point where they if they if they repeal Obamacare and you know maybe tax especially the United states will happen here what are their favorite deal and then they come back to the old good old fashioned catastrophic plan and then we can bring bring the cost of health care backed out\nOkay so right now you're telling me that if you uh were to get a concierge service with one with your doctor and there were doctors who do that I Know some who've done that actually and that covers your relationship to the doctor but it doesn't cover the blood test it doesn't cover the MRI it doesn't have any of those things right\nRight well well sometimes the company actually about ... and ... and the blood test but but without the without the MRI and\nAll right so ... so you need you need the catastrophic plan but you can't buy a catastrophic plan on that basis today correct\nCorrect as I said\nOkay so you'd have to buy it under Obamacare which means that sixty four year old woman would have to get contraception and pregnancy insurance right right correct now that is how do you sell that with a straight face\nWell we're right in right now you can't ... right right now you need legislation that we we we need we need to go by whichever appeal you know you go back to work out a traditional cash got hit by the way they go back to a traditional doctor patient relationship and and uh\nUh care because 'cause right now right now you can't get the care you're white you catch the doctors you want it costs a lot of money to even have a drug policy\nWell and so we're really ... even though we got rid of the individual mandate we still have the requirement that companies with over fifty employees and ah as part of the person works thirty hours a week they have to give them health insurance correct\nRight that is correct yeah like I said\nSo are we really haven't done much about that and we've done little or nothing since getting rid of the individual mandate about it um and and the American people are very concerned about health insurance says you know so like the Republicans\nAre going to have a hard time there are a lot of other issues going on I'll be asleep when they were going to have a hard time this November justifying the little or nothing they've done about health care in this country because they've done nothing\nRight here and fight and part of that is you know unfortunately you know we really only a few votes in the fed and they're not that sixty votes get whatever care passed a Democrat sixty votes and is that right we also yeah\nI'd I realize it's a problem now because of the

President Trump building another campaign rally friday night this time in Cincinnati, Ohio addressing the release of an American pastor from turkey\nWell my my my book came out of a essay contest that uh I was an entrepreneur I was a businessman and I started hanging out with ... and\nFell hearsay and so you didn't come out of a religious background you came out of a a a secular back right exactly\nI was I was actually one of the founding employees of MTV music television back in the early eighties\nOh my goodness congressional elections [laughter]\nIs that came out of the New York television and radio business as a matter of fact and\nUm and eventually I became an entrepreneur and then but I had a a deep spiritual long long for a higher purpose to my life\nUm you know and I always thought business kind of as they\nAre trailing indicator or the the the the the the result of my spiritual life and I started hanging out with these trap is monks that ... at a monastery down in South Carolina in the\nIn the nineties how\nHappen wow it's really fascinating story really because I was ... always fascinated by just taking a subject that where you were talking about what is the higher purpose in life what is you know what is the big picture what can I can give my life uh a a big meaning\nAnd um and so I was hanging out with these books and it was always ... I was already coaching some college students I live in the Raleigh Durham\nArea of North Carolina was working at Duke University in Carolina anyway these kids get me to go sky diving with them\nAnd I go sky diving is I like to say I wrote a book actually called the business secrets of the trap is monks and in that book I describe how I was brave enough to jump out of an airplane but not brave enough to tell there's darn kids I was too old to be jumping on airplanes\nI smashed my ankle all up Mike and ah I ended up in the hospital and started having these terrible panic attacks\nAnd triggered a dark night of the solar was confronted my ... for the first time\nAnd are really can finally get and the hardest thing to us but all my spiritual seeking and uh and there are books that I'd written all this stuff that I've done in my life when I look forward to fall back on it wasn't there I didn't have a higher purpose but I thought I did\nAnd so one of my students having to call me on the phone or during the summer of Nineteen\nAh why why did you start thinking about that by the way why did you start thinking about a higher purpose we all get caught up\nIn our day to day activities and all of a sudden you're\nThinking about that you were you were an entrepreneur business\nVery successful business guy why did you start thinking about that at all\nI started that actually came on our way back to my college you know I was a child of the late sixties early seventies college and uh\nYou know you just gave a speech a couple of nights ago and granted she and I said there were two things that are that I remember even from back then were a couple of books that I read one by Joseph cambell in another by a on another guy and he said that there's there's two things are stuck in my mind and one was\nA that sometimes that usually sometimes in your early twenties\nFor most people in some way shape or form a you look around and you say is is it\nI mean you've been drunk a couple of times you maybe had sex with a couple of times you maybe you've had a chance to drive a fast car once or twice just wait a second is that all there is\nUm and ah isn't there something ... isn't there something more to life than that I said of the other uh thing that the guys that his he said there's a certain people get eased by the idea that there is something bigger and they go looking for it it's you know is Joseph cambell hero's journey the quest\nFor something bigger in your life and I actually got started in that when I was just a kid and uh and uh you know I often tell people you know people like to thank me as a businessman who has this spiritual interest I said no I always thought of myself\nAs a spiritual guy who happened to be in business not the other way around so I expect that goes away back a long time for me so I get this call from my kid from this\nStudent ... said argue I Want to tell you that I'm taking your advice I said what advice you said you told us to do something meaningful with our lives rather than just a chase girls during the summer and I said well what do you do and he said I'm spending my summer at the\nAt this I'm Catholic monastery this trap is monastery these monks who stays silent all the time\nAnd uh and it was something about his voice there is something that I that just triggers something in me at that time I get I was going through these having these I was into having depression and a ... a real serious dark night type of experience and I said hey I Want to come and he said when and I said right now and then I realized I was at my desk at my business it was Wednesday I said no this weekend\nHe said let me talk to a brother John which was the first time ever her brother John name\n[noise] and he came back a few minutes later they said they said come on down this weekend and I came down and I was extremely moved by their lifestyle and\nAnd uh and and the purpose of the way they were living their lives and I came back the next weekend in the next weekend and eventually I applied for what is called a um [noise] a monastic yes that is where you can stay for extended periods when I went down and spent the Christmas of Nineteen Ninety six I spent three weeks there\nAnd I kept going and going back for twenty two years\nSo they let you come in and and now what are you there since they

for the longest\nTo Iraq and he has done a book about his experiences with a monastery amongst its called brother John among a pilgrim and the purpose of life so let me ask you because um it comes down to a bottom line of how we live\nYou've done very well in business and now you've had this great influence on your life\nFor the monastery and the months\nOr a ... and you spend\nForty five forty eight weeks a year living in a secular world and you live at three or four or five weeks a year perhaps in this my monastery live\nAre you living what most of us would consider to be at a high a level of material wealth with the big home and a great cars and ... you know two thousand dollar suits and all of that sort of thing\nWell you know I I'm I'm living ... pretty well I mean I I how I honor Seventy five acre farm outside of our Raleigh North Carolina that bought back in two thousand out of our our lease it to somebody who raises cattle here\nUm but actually most of uh uh I'm not actually very materialistic or\nWe'll see what I'm trying to get to and then that only to be a ... at the defense will get your defense of what I'm trying to get to is whether you are living what year preaching\nBecause the yeah I don't expect you to say you're living you know I'm I'm a amongst life and then in poverty and all that\nBut I'm Wondering if it's affected your lifestyle in terms of how well you live given the fact that this whole thing is about giving the other people\nLet me put it another way what my primary and if things are formed a nonprofit corporation\nUm a Fifteen Years ago after one that Templeton Prize all of the money that I make for many of my books any my lectures anybody speeches any my personal coaching all of it goes to the nonprofit corporation I don't like any salary out of it at all I've also offers started a wing of my\nUh a subset of non profit to help young kids\nWho are failing in our public schools because of a big a school choice person and I have I've met some some disadvantaged kids and I'm actually underwriting there uh them to go to Christian schools and stuff like that so I'm doing doing that help them find the purpose of their life\nBut the ... the\nThe uh\nThe whole rest of my nonprofit corporation and all my work I as I said I just got back from giving a speech and at the granite yacht club through a bunch of businessmen up there\nIs to help people find a higher purpose you know it's not just the things you were talking about earlier which I'm a hundred percent with Mike when you're split off your show\nWhich are the political aspects of the purpose northwest by state or what we would I Would say you know what you were talking about you were describing Neal is um you know uh there's ... ... people are they're not ... you know they uh they say they have purpose but they really are just about destruction but there's something else going on there was an article in um the\nNew York magazine about the opioid crisis called the um the poison we pick it was written by Andrew Sullivan you know and of course New York magazine's not exactly the most conservative organization so I was surprised to hear him say that the opioid crisis\nIs a spiritual crisis of American I'm going to quote real quickly something for you here out of that article he said this nation pioneered modern life\nNow epic numbers of Americans are killing themselves with opioids to escape it\nTo see this epidemic is simply a pharmaceutical are chemically addictive properties to miss something\nThat despair that currently make so many want to fly away\nOpioids are just one of the ways Americans are trying to cope with an n human new world where everything is flat where communication is a virtual and where those core elements of human happiness bay\nFamily community theme to boot so many until we resolve these deeper social cultural and psychological problems until we discover a new meaning\nOr re imagined our old religion or return to our over religion or reinvent our new our way of life I Am afraid the puppy will flourish\nAnd uh and that really really struck me that this is exactly you know what the world the world Health Organization said the biggest single health issue in the west today\nOh western cultures depression\nAlcoholism suicide is way up I mean you\nYoung men today you know in the face of all the turmoil this going on there that are scraping into video games they're scraping into staying in their parents' basements until there's thirty we're seeing a crisis of of of meeting a purpose I think that Donald Trump some of these people a lot of people in the rural areas and I live out in the rural area\nOf North Carolina and drug addiction and everything is rampant out here\nUm people are don't have that sense of higher meeting a purpose in their lives and you know when you when you think about faith and community especially that's what the monks have\nAnd and what they have is they have a higher purpose you know what they're they're not you know a brother John thinks oh you know it's kind of like to call all the way back to Jack Kennedy and I'm not a huge fan of Jacques and he's but he did say something and it's a novel but who could say this today\nAsk not what your country can do for you what can you do for your country ask not what your community can do for you what could you do for your community\nThe people that you were talked describing early on in your ... and ... in the beginning of your show they're not thinking about what they do they're taking me me me me\nYou know I Need to be hurt you have to do is let me I'm In my point of view my point of view you know I Want to take me at the football game take report where I'm a you know I'm a center of attention you know and this is the helicopter parents with all the helicopter kids\nSo to me the idea that\nThat uh that we need a higher purpose we need to live for something bigger than a than ourselves for community for what's good for the country what's good for for a fellow man and this is it gets back to that stuff with that stuff that we were talking about\nI said but then you have to have a um uh you you still have to have you were in business you have to have goals objectives strategies tactics\nAnd ways in which you get from point a to point out in the ruins a to point soon as somebody can be flailing their arms around saying I Want to help somebody and uh and because actually when you when you get out of new yourself and then the the hedonistic\nUh types of the ... for a black lives matter or the groups that are just in self indulgent or where and when Martin O'Malley from Maryland and went to a than a black lives matter meeting and they said all lives matter they booed him\nI Know is this the only only black lives and of course black lives matter and then there's no question about that and then he discrimination and then he ah abuse of black people or or any people is
