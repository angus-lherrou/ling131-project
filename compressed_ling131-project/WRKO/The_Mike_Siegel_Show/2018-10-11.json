other rats on the left side of the aisle\nI think she was digging our own political grave and article retire unfortunately as Joel Gilbert told us on this program the film producer he believes she's running and the fact that she constantly is out there and constantly has these despicable comments\n\nMakes you wonder whether she may be running\nAnd then she has the nerve to say her husband got treated worse than Donald Trump\n\nWith regard to the allegations about a sexual harassment of women\n\nNone of the cases of the women involved allegedly with Donald Trump have ever had any other any credibility with any of their stories\nIt's never been confirmed is never been corroborated it's never been determined that he did was alleged that he did what Bill Clinton the opposite\nThat is true when he'd abroad was raped\nAnd you can go to the bank that Bill Clinton did not rape or he wouldn't be filing lawsuits he would be denying it he doesn't say a word about it does he\nOr Kathleen Willie whom I interviewed several times who described what happened in the oval office when she was volunteering and he grabbed at her and she described to me on the air how on this program several years ago how his neck bones\nAnd anger his face termed red\nHe was out of control and she left that room only because the oval office only because someone on the outside knock on doors that Mr

under oath but they said they saw this\nAnd then there's Paula corporate Jones who he exposed himself to her in office something would happen she wouldn't do a thing and then she said that if they if they went to trial which was possibly going to happen\nChicken ... describes certain unusual features of his private parts\nThat would prove that she was the victim of an exposure and sexual harassment by Clinton against her and Clinton paid or eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars to keep her quiet so if you want to tell me\nThat\nBill Clinton was treated worse than Donald Trump you gotta some land and the Everglades I'm going to sell you Hillary Clinton is absolutely wrong about that Bill Clinton got away with rape\n\nAnd now she's talking about civility not being

personal about it\nWhen you debate someone best what it ought to be about not personal attacks if they if if if Kavanaugh for example had been a Democratic president appointed person let's just say in

she's done a TV interview\nA solo not with the president\nBut on her own and I'm talks about her marriage it's going to err on friday on ABC\n\nTen o'clock eastern time\n\nAnd one of the stipulations in the interview she was told by chief national affairs correspondent Tom ... is that\nYou did agree a millennia to this interview to your credit with no preconditions knowing that there could be some tough questions asked\n\nSo this is going to um I think the quite fascinating she was asked about the state of her marriage her husband's infidelity her views on the me too movement\n\nOne of the questions asked by the interviewer is Ken and women and let me too movement call you a supporter\n\nVery direct legitimate question\n\nAnd he goes on to ask subsequently says you're not the first first lady to have to deal with your husband's infidelity has this put a strain on your marriage\n\nAnd then he asked about that jak remember the jacket\nShe wore when she was\nRight after the Justice Department an accident an order allowing parents and children to be separated at the border the big controversy over the parents and their children separated at the border\nYou remember she wore that Zara jacket and on the back and read I really don't care\nDo you want like on a lot of attention and she's going to answer that question in this interview\nAnd then in the ass or lamas asks are about the biggest misconception that the public has about her\n\nAnd actually they did the interview and African member a last week the first lady was in Africa and she while they're agreed to do is sit down\n\nOver a year now since baloney as even given an interview with a major network and um most of the time it's been with her husband that are side\nThe one one time when she was on her own was when she spoke with Fox and friends ... Lee Earhart who does the morning show\nWith Stephen Lucy and Brian kill me and he's really did a segment where there are filmed before the annual congressional picnic\nAnd she talked about the fact that she could not be happier just a couple of weeks after moving into the White House with her son barren and of course the president's son barren\nAnd that was um I think six months after the president took office because Baron had the finished school and they didn't want to switch it she says she was enjoying the White House very much at the time\nAnd that barren loved the move\n\nShe talked about putting together our first picnic at the White House\n\nAnd it was um I suppose you could same fluffier as an interview then obviously what the St Lucie interview is going to be it was much shorter as well this is the longer interview with ABC\nSo we'll see apparently she was asked only four questions during this twenty minute interview\nThat she did with things but year heart\nBut this new interview is going to be totally different and so you get to see her friday night we've not seen enough of a she has so much to offer in my opinion I she's incredibly bright speaks five languages\nWomen have been so Ruben nicer name of the Washington Post made fun of her about her how she speaks English and there's this big sales remarkably well\nAnd it was a stunning to me how you'd make fun of something like that when she's from a foreign country learned English along with three other languages beside her native language and probably is far more intellect in her pinky then that woman ruined does in our whole body it's it's that's how sick the left is\nAlways make a personal attack the woman does our best to speak English and this Ruben at Washington Post criticizes her and that's where I met in the last segment about the politics of personal destruction\nIs in the city is it is pervasive and that is\nI Hope destroying the Democratic party\nI'd like to think that they're getting no place with it\nThe ... where he wants to keep the lack of civility\nThen let her go for it and let her bring the Democratic party down even further how much further down to could go course who knows but it's really from any level of respect it's it's lost it totally lost it\n\nA legislator\nAnd this is quite fascinating\nIs proposing that\nTry to manage and trying to come up with some kind of try to deal with China have not entirely clear yet what how that's going to work out\nWell the thing that the ... that's the bottom line for me and you don't have to be an economist to to to believe this\nIs that if there's going to be a trade deal it needs to be fair we need to have the same access to the Chinese people as the Chinese businesses have to the American people and of course as you know the problem is the Chinese government winds up and joint ventures with other corporations from outside of China\nTaking a piece of the action from those corporations in setting the rules established so corporations can operate in China\nThat's got to change their not a free market place the government of China controls what happens in that economy\nRight there is a widespread recognition at that problem among Americans or the the Chinese ah got to get to the ambassador to the world Trade Organization said last week or so since the county that we\nBuy it I suspect that's going to change or they're gonna have to make some kind of confessions\nBefore they get a at before they're able to get an agreement and the president has tightened down as tighten screws my parents is talking about it and China stock market has been tumbling today as well but try stock market has been tumbling and it's created a lot of financial problems for them and\nMove out because they feel like there's a ... if you're going to have these trade or if they need to find places to create a stable supply for them that China's economy\nAnd the bottom line too is that China a indelibly needs the American consumer the American market to send it swears it's the biggest market\nThat they send their wares to wouldn't that be a motivator of\nChina can say it doesn't need it but it it it it's going to Kenya with it's kinda gross it's had it's going to need the U.S be able to buy products\nYeah so therefore I'm ... we have a nice and the whole so to speak\nTo use that leverage and the president knows how to use the leverage but it's also true that former presidents have talked to a great deal even Ronald Reagan went to Japan\nWould lay Iacocca and they talked about American cars going to Japan they talked about a fair trade and the Japanese smiled and said yes that's a good idea and never did anything about it so even Reagan couldn't get it done\nRight and and Fleischer who used to pressure for George W. Bush mentioned is back when a President Trump met with the European Union people and ... and it you know if Trump went into Iraq pay more for your fans\nOf George Bush or come in and say that agreement they never did anything into a\nTrump at least try to press that issue more and I just have them say yes and go on and never act on it so he's able to do that but he's trying to make sure that they act as opposed to their head\nI think also I these these is expressing himself in a very realistic fashion that at this point China's not ready he used that phrase that they're not ready and I'm a down the road hopefully they will be but you know as you got to patients to deal with a Asian countries have great patience and look at the long term and\nThe guys that played right there and for the long haul and so she doesn't stand for election so he can he can he can be very unpopular and still managed to maintain his uh his position\nNo question about a ... it's always a pleasure we think of being with us we'll get to the health care next time around\nA continued success of this for policy innovation stay the course we love you thank you have a good evening sir bicycle here because we're the snakes were great our we come back on the other side don't go away\nLong distance travel or long hours in front of the computer can take its toll on your body\nGet relief for your neck or back pain when you search Amazon were Simpson pillows heating maps and then often listed as an Amazon choice why take another pill no from sunny day in customer demand we introduced or extra long Mickey ram\nWiden hands free and brings spends relief to those who suffer from it move back you can easily find some time pillows on Amazon ... news ... look for ... heated Nick rats were released from back dean to ...\nSometimes can be ... in ...\nOr ... or ... vitamin D.

uh obviously ... at the early age no one Israeli aware much about the history of of of the country of any country that is that what the world\nAnd the only when you are kind of a high school you began to assemble it she was suffering from Michigan staring at you you hear 'em\nElderly people speak you you you get you know more about it we\nAre answering your parents most importantly grandparents and parents because it's in their family and they are not afraid to talk of the thing about the Soviet Union one of the things that have been created in that monstrosity was the government that discouraged free speech completely if not it was not there\nPeople just to hear you quoted predict correct number twenty million is probably low level they closed the between twenty and thirty of their own people that you usually have experimented\nA as a political refuges political political dissent in Politico cornered and food and it is there any kind of an opposition any kind of free speech was disallowed than anyone caught they won't be about government in boats dog against though it\nWould make them disappear it's not necessarily kill him but they would send them into the labor camps everyone knows the word gulag I think most of the if you know what it right\nSo so then uh Stalin was never condemned um uh\nBy the by the Soviet Union even in later years that his his whatever reputation he had was protected even though he killed so many people is that correct that you're you didn't really know style ones being really another version of Hitler basically\nIn in um you know in some way or in start where there is there a tragic it's a very hard to be a Soviet history and so many people struggled with it you know he was complicated\nUm perhaps down and didn't know any better he became a monster some stuff\nAnd not until a crucial to power when push ups took power in the in the late ...\nThat's when truth was coming out and more people were made aware more and more people were made aware of the of the atrocities and you know there are incredible\nI'm watching this stuff that we dream and extermination those millions of people don't even in early\nLate fifties early sixties it was kind of a warm up a little bit of a warm up when he was\nThe people with this whole region and people were informed that what happened and they were trying to be allowed to speak up till the system began to change make adjustments recognized and what was passed\nAnd everybody knows every almost every Russians Soviet family experience some kind of a heart either download the children of their uncles cousins somebody this year was taking away and people have been here\nMany manually until probably or at least ... and it's kind of a soft and do\nYou know that that the today most Russians would be very aware of the history of Joseph Stalin than I Am I correct\nYes yes they they are very aware of where they know are they read a there's a whole lot more freedom of speech people people get information on the books from the Internet many movies have been made\nAnd they trying to steal the voice and to move on and and build a better society\nAre so let me might go ahead oh\nI was going to ask you to them ... what is this something very fascinating\nBecause you were raised in the Ukraine which was part of the Soviet Union in those days now of course it's free and a Crimea now as as you said is a\nIn debate the Russians have taken it over\nUm we get them to put in as a whole lot of interest in expanding back to the Soviet Union\nBut you joined the Soviet military which to me it would mean that you were in ... the Soviet Union at the time you joined the military so did you not question the ah the dogmatic totalitarian nature of the government then you were

Stalin situation\nUm I think anyone would agree um you can put them in Hitler's ... category as ... as the Monica is Adolf Hitler was Joseph Stalin\nUh the question would be this\nGermany has passed laws\nAgainst virulent anti Semitism they protect against\nAnything like what Hitler did happening again and the laws you can't um\nDo text books in school or do pamphlets\nThat are virulently anti Semitic or anti Jewish\nBecause of what happened with Hitler they acknowledge Hitler as being what he was the Soviet Union ever acknowledge in the laws what Stalin did to try to protect against what he that ever happening again did they did they do the same as what Germany to\nKnow they're there to take it so that's like no they did not\nSo therefore uh we don't and then the call was making the point that there was never really the commitment a in the Soviet Union for that and the people the people and continue delivering and suppression in all pressured and the Soviet Union weather was Khrushchev\nOr even Gorbachev who's then lightened fellow still lives in San Francisco or who came to love Ronald Reagan a but even land the Soviet Union was still the Soviet Union the politburo and the ... bill is KGB still function so let me ask you then\nUm what was in your thought process when you when listed as the third generation grandfather father to use the son and grandson\nEnlisting in the navy and the Soviet Union did you feel a passion I mean we've as you know you've been in this country or citizen you know\nHow young men after nine eleven and more recently have considered as a privileged to enter the military risk their lives\nAnd the weather is Afghanistan or Iraq or a ... a cutter uh when we went there to deal with the problems that the Saddam Hussein was raising\n'em and and all of the issues that have come up in the middle east but these guys and women are passionately members of our military were you a passionate member of the Soviet military believing that you were fighting with your life for something that you believe then\nNo it was about the fight there was no war Soviet Union was not in the state of you know\nOr in the seventies when I um I graduated from high school in Odessa\nAnd basically the service is mandatory people either go whether you like it or not it's just the way of life that's how it used to be it was a contractors army or the armed forces you to join a regular service or you are getting like you said you're going to the ... school\nSo I chose to go to the uh the marathons in Odessa\nWhere I became a marine engineer and also a guy that ranks lieutenant and part of education was uh involved in the navy and so I spent some time in Sevastopol which is the naval base\nIn uh in Crimea so if\nYou know in in the sense that the call of duty and it's a responsibility for people who serve their country at that time it wasn't about the war effort it wasn't about anything else you have to serve like kind of what you know in the United states\nAre doing it now era lots and lots of protests right it's not going to go now Russia you put not as if you protest it it will go to jail that's been\nOkay so that's basically what you're saying is if I hear you correctly is that is a huge it was just assumed that one joined the military and some branch of the Soviet military you did the navy\nAnd uh you know you really never question\nThere was never part of your thought process to say well should I Do this do do I belong to the\nQuestion now you're gonna wish me you're just you're just doing what you're told to\nDo and and and all the people have to serve and a lot of women too you know so that's that's how it was at that time we talking about mid ... cheese and the early eighties it was a Nineteen Seventy nine my family was able to get out to escape and\nA wall or to the United states but were specifically addressing the time before the Afghanistan war ... ... ...\n... he I was going to say you the Soviet Union does get into a war in Afghanistan are so [noise] uh and so the bottom line than it is\nBut you did that uh did you at that time understand that your country was oppressive of freedom of freedom and and uh uh rights of individuals that were you aware of how the United states function and then you knew the difference is that correct\nNo we did not know nobody really knew about much about the United states you remember we were behind what Winston Churchill defined as they are including\nBut we didn't really know much about the west we all knew about the world that will have been and I grew up in a in the Soviet Union and the atmosphere of Cold War oppression and here that I remember very well\nAnd so but you would what did you and your own mind to have problems with the country you were living in that they weren't that you didn't have freedom\nYeah\nEverybody has some degree of fear you've never okay\nUh what what ... what would happen\nTo you and your mouth shut and that's it's still too much and not to discuss the government because there was no one knows where everyone nearly as if people just stay very quiet because they fear was that\nI was just a bunch of them were well of course in the military particularly but um but but did you understand that this was not good and that you would like to have had greater freedom in your homeland get\nYes many many people dreamed about their menu people waste or many people hope that there would be it would come when the country will become clear\nAnd people will be allowed to speak their mind absolute yes we're\nOnly now opening and dreaming about that\nAll right so this so then your family left for the United states at least in part because of the press of nature of the Soviet Union is that correct", "year": "2018",
