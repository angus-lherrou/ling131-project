he did not help her there's some would say well he did help her she did a lot better than she would have otherwise done um so you can't really say\nThat um\nBut it wasn't helpful I guess that's true you can't quantify maybe more people didn't vote for her because of Obama and she's still lost ... lost by more I guess you could make that case but\nWhat's interesting to me is that what do you when he goes in to you to pay for somebody for Congress\nThey don't do very well\nSo you see the Robert Francis doesn't want him to a door so I did see that the on the matter of fact so all of that story I Do a good thing to do even hold onto it and that I Do a little something something an hour but but but I I Want to hear that I I find\nThat to be kind of amazing ah meantime we say about super beats

himself into a plea he does he's not looking for an endorsement from former President Obama I was stunned by this\nYes this is from the blaze from our president bronco bottom recently released a long list of two hundred sixty democratic candidates he's endorsing across the U.S\nJust weeks before the November midterm elections the Texas Senate candidate beta or work was noticeably missing US Congressman from El Paso told to foreigners at a recent campaign and then he did not want Obama's endorsement because it didn't help candidates in previous elections I don't think we're interested in endorsement or work during the recent town hall meeting the Texas Tribune report and\nI'm so grateful to him for his service is going down as one of the greatest presidents and yet this election's on Texas\nA bomb is not eleven Texan Democrats according to the Tribune a war is hoping and the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz on November ... six\nWorks that he defeated former Democratic representative so that's ... and the two thousand twelve Democratic primary despite the fact rats received endorsements from Obama and former President Bill Clinton according to the Tribune Bill Clinton those are the county Calif than that screaming al Paso times front page headlines of president urges El Paso to stick with the ... works that\nAnd we won and what that drove home for me it at someone else's popularity is not transferable to aid given candidate\nAnd a Political Report it's called the raise the concept that recent polls show cruise headed toward Emerson College so crews had like five points and it certainly among likely voters and CBS News poll shows cruise leading a walk by six points among registered voters\nSo here's the question is it ... it really isn't an answer and that and that story but I Wonder if you've heard anything\nDid he not want it or did he just not get it\nOn the story and says he didn't want it\nI don't think we're and well\nKnow is that aren't and I mean well okay ... when he's not going to say\nThat you think he's really going to say well and the President Obama did not want to get the one that we're going to go out there and say we weren't interested anyway\nWell let's say that Obama puts out a list and you're running for election or you say your name as a novelist of course you're each was going to be I didn't want it\n... yeah my guess you're not going to start do you believe it didn't endorse being ... you're not going to say that but I I Want to know the real scoop\nI Want to know the true story did he just not get it or do the duty as President Obama to not endorse him inquiry minds want to know do we\nIdea but I don't think we're ever going to get that answer did you call back though can you call and I know your town ... campaign not really that a\n... a veto now um which is interesting is I I've been seeing a lot of TV ads for him and uh and and also I mean here's your radio ads it's a lot of of just be geo

last movie more\nHe's the Hispanic John F. Kennedy Robert Kennedy\nAlthough he's not Hispanic at all or no you're going to put it out there\nSo so that's what's happening that's very good to me that's very interesting but he's not getting the Obamas endorsement and you know he says that though says he's not interested in an endorsement from Obama I'm betting if you would have gotten the north from from a bomb and you would have been interested in it\nProbably sounds\nBecause if you're Obama who do you want to back you what about people who really have a chance right of\nCourse people who they were gonna win and win big\nYeah he doesn't want he already he he's getting\nThe albatross because of a because we're really close and I don't think he wants to be part of his race to be honest with you let me go to the phone lines are quick we don't have a whole lot of time but I Want to see a load of John on line one John what's going on I\nHow're you doing tonight or whatever's after our bachelor or a editor a\nResignation or restrain the rat swaying while a by a President Bush is er very well\nThat was the second day that the caught a lesser rice was coming through the White House tomorrow and I was wondering uh fat or that probably the best choice for a partner at Vassar to the U.S\n... rice would be a great choice now I don't know the vet has anything to do with it to be honest with you as one of the ... the ...

Ford they set in their letter the following it is inconceivable\nThat the FBI could conduct they thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified and our letter to you and call\nAnd I\nShake my head and I say are you kidding that's almost an ethical violation\nFrivolous activity on the part of those attorneys\nFolks if you remember Dr Ford spent several hours being investigated\nAnd being questioned under oath\nBy ms Mitchell\nThe prosecutor of sexual assault cases from Arizona\nAnd that's\nMore than I Am not even adequate it's Thoreau\nEverything that could have been asked was asked by ms Mitchell of Dr Ford and then you have judge Kavanaugh who spent several hours in the same way dealing with questions\nFrom the committee Democrats went after him lock stock and barrel\nMs Mitchell started for the Republicans and then it turned into the Republican members of the committee wanting to question judge Kavanaugh\nThey felt that having these eleven white men\nMiddle aged men in bed and questioned the judge Dr Ford would have been\nLooked at by the left wing as overkill course on the left wing complained that they should have asked the questions themselves and not had the prosecutor from Arizona doing a woman who has basically protected victims of sexual assault who are women\nYou would think they would want somebody like that but now not these Democrats they want to have political cover and devious despicable Miss USA and the views\nOf the confirmation process to go after the president and after the conservatives and do something that is absolutely heinous and take saw the part of that brick cats and Michael Brown which the two attorneys for Dr Ford a whole lot chutzpah\nWell\nWe know as I said that this investigation is about wrapping up could be a vote by friday\nAnd I think that\nIt is almost a fictional story that you would have that same movie showing the reprehensible way in which the Democrats have handled this thing the unfairness of it and any one of them put under the same microscope\nWould be found to have had some kind of ... some kind of problem in their lives\nThat would justify there being removed from the Senate if they want to use this kind of standard for removing a nominee from a Supreme Court nomination why should they even be in the set of course the difference is going to be in the arguments going to be that the public votes on them and therefore the public ought to have\nThe final say on elected officials and the public thinks that something about a senator is a problem then they can vote against that person but if any one of them were put under the same microscope as judge Kavanaugh how would they come out\nAnd wouldn't it be nice\nTo see what the reaction would be they say the judge was angry why shouldn't they be angry\nHe had a right to be angry\nHis is absolutely nonsensical\nSenator Lindsey Graham who's been the hero\nFor judge Kavanaugh on the United States Senate suggested the president that they should re nominate judge Kavanaugh if the Senate fails to confront them for the Supreme Court senator and said that earlier today\nNow as Senator Corker said I mentioned earlier Senator Graham also believes the capital is going to be confirmed to the Supreme Court very soon and they also mentioned Mitch McConnell the majority leader is saying that it that he'll be voted on this week\nWe've we've been ignored that both Democrats and Republicans and your point Donald making that the moderate Republicans have protected illegal immigration because the big businesses who contributed to the Republicans want cheap labor and the Democrats want the votes down the road a Soviet turning all they they have their own entrenched interest\nIn that I Know in the meantime that include and not only are they all illegal but then you know violent criminals weight on the case finally story ah I mean there's a whole bunch of others that I've interviewed parents of young people who were killed by illegal aliens or to the point of a ... and it's sick\nAnd it doesn't stop because it continues to happen and the Democrats Tony that acknowledge the families of those victims or those victimization is they just look the other way outta and down and you know and because and then yeah then with with foreigners in Missouri they brought Michael Brown's mother\nTo the Democratic convention and I just shake my head because he killed himself he went after police officers gun one or do you think it was going to happen so exactly\nYou know so you know a Democrats have sold out to to rationality and then and that's where the problem is and I when I was coming up to an election what do you make of what's going to happen now\nI'm just an open their their enough Americans\nUm have seen first of all the fruit from doing things the more conservative where was this one thinks Trump is doing if they've seen while it's actually is helping the economy pilots I got a job and I didn't have one before and different things they're starting to see you know what\nIt 'cause there's a point where it ... or the average person that's not a radical that doesn't have the jet that they've just been given information many people have been given bad information so they are on the wrong side of things not 'cause they're evil\nBecause they've just been brainwashed but I think as the rubber meets the road and and if we can just hoping and praying that we can get\nA they keep the majority in the house and Senate and and so a Trump can continue to do the conservative things that he's talking about and he's pursuing unlike any other presidents we've had in decades at a level is\nUm they're going to start to see how things are really helping things out there they're not hurt that left all she was gonna destroy this country and it seems to be getting better and there seems to be just the you know everyone is just doing better than they were before\nAnd so I'm hoping that that some of that reality it's some of the people that aren't radicals the radicals you can't\nDeal with them because they they've just ... their ... their their mind is set and shows and and and their cause or whatever it is it's become their religion likes to it's like a blind ... it's a weird thing is is that as I talk to them all go out to\nRallies and stuff but the ... you just talk to real nicely college students to see what they're thinking in pain they're just they're just not all there it's if they'd been so brainwashed they can't discuss the issues they can't\nUnderstand the different sides of staying in different points of view and so but yeah I Know this is a key election for sure and uh and we need to get out each of us have each of us influence three people before the election that all of a sudden we got\nThree times the number of people vote in the right way and that are going to go vote for that I mean we just need to everyone listening east realize you were all responsible\nTo do what we can do it might be one person inputs but that's one that's been a couple of yourself we can't count on Trump we can't kill everybody else to get things done we need to get things done when we need to make a difference ourself no matter how small it seems because all big change change always starts at the bottom as I\nStudied the laughter last hundred years and made agenda grinding America down\nI saw all their stuff started small and slow and they were stuck with it when they weren't making any progress stuck with it when the country with against communism they just kept Claudine away\n'cause they wanted a Marxist future and they didn't care if they were making except they were committed to the cause and it now we look a hundred years later and go wow they successful\nHow did this little fringe minority do this\nAnd that's what we need to do we need to impact our own children and grandchildren that number one place to start and then just go out to our neighbors into it and slowly find people that are willing to listen to him and educate them well what's going on because\nUm we all have a role in this and that there is no way one person or one party or it can get everything done that needs to be ...\nWell you know the the problem you referred to were looted to their uh is in the schools um if a kid comes into school I remember the case of a kid with a T shirt that was a man or a T shirt and it was really the Marines\nAnd the crossing rifles as the logo of the Marines and the ... the they said you can't wear that shirt here even though it was it was American military symbol\nUm ... which gave them the freedom to do this this this speaking that they are doing in the schools or I mean you can go through the list of all the political ... one kid was at the University of Pennsylvania\nAnd some girls came by and arrest him at his window while he was studying in his dorm room and he said something like um oh you water buffalo get outta here\nAnd the school of thought it was a racial ah disparaged but it turned out it was nothing of the kind that's it's a phrase they didn't even know that the school it was just a phrase that she was for real people who are annoying you and he wound up getting suspended I think for a semester\nFor something that didn't mean

being an audience and be part of the show would you be motivated would you be going forward would you be cited would you be moved us really well\n... north Americans who are in\nLine to get that would match dot com\nBubble boy so Boston you walk walking over one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\nOn ABC News\nI'm Richard camp who\nThat has legalized recreational marijuana much less medical marijuana so my question would be why shouldn't have been able to use\nMedical marijuana under the ... of a physician giving him periodic prescriptions for the marijuana in order to Libya to Spain since he was terminal anyway and they give them some quality of life or what do you have for one time he had left why not allow him to do that\nSays this is a very interesting question and that you know I think it is to court and to to to of course but the fact that uh\nWhen we talk about medical marijuana we're talking about you know if they showed a prescribed medication so\nI think if we have for example for ... Gulf ... patients yeah you know\nThere was a medication that certainly the case of that I used to reduce notice yeah for example\nAnd ... and it is to have been well studied for that matter how\nBad is it different from the creation of marijuana when we talk about medical marijuana or token up by a specific diagnostic is that it has been down to buy a medical professional or to the doctor\nAnd that it it is fast is prescribed by a doctor with a specific dollar pitch and with a follow up as difficult follow up so I think in that context\nIt could really well guarded ... egg case and a way that well yeah I Believe that analysis eh yeah we've we've been people who have actually benefited from medical marijuana\n... it by his tail we cannot say that uh we have\nAll that we use that that we need at this point to add a curriculum and the treatment with marijuana for the general population and you know for various different cases for example there people are benefited\nFrom marijuana people with the\nTreatment resistant at the for example and am catches a chronic pain has been mentioned as though I Believe I could do for specific as we can do this but we still need a lot of\nResearch out because they point to be able to\nStandardize the treatment it it you know if we had ... because we need\nA level of evidence to to be able to correct command\nAnd the treatment that why you with you that the majority of doctors do not prescribed but yet they cannot be a treat the patient in most countries and that most they\nWell they don't that they don't prescribe it now but we certainly seemed to have some evidence of a lot of marijuana helping certainly this one fellow that I was just talking about\nPutting them out of his pain alleviated but that would go back to the point you're right so let's say maybe you can do it with the general population but why couldn't they physician in any state\nHave the authority to issue a prescription for medical marijuana if in fact in the case of the person I just described Italy basis pain or in another person's case it may have a beneficial effect\nI'm In other words it aren't prescription drugs issued because they've trained physician says this should be helpful to you\nAnd therefore I'll give you a prescription that you can use within the parameters of the dosage I give you\nA sense to me that the law should eliminate that when they got good to know more about it than the than the law\nYeah absolutely that's ... that's what I think that we we need to get you know the politics out of the matter 'cause it's a health issue and I believe that if a doctor\nMakes at diagnostic Korea diagnosis and realizes that the only treatment option that he had for the patient is medical marijuana I Believe it doctor and patient should have the\nOpportunity to decide on what treatment option to use you know\nSo I think for that matter I understand it absolutely that we need to get the politics out of it because these patients adopt a\nIssue and I think it should be treated like that\nBad with that said I think we need the ... the er at the AT T quicker wait wait till late to\nTo be very uh to land and take it because it's been ... for example for the yeah the ... period crises that\nYou can tease sometimes some [noise] you know medical professionals who can have a tendency to ... to describe\nA you know it
