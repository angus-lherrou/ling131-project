about one hundred and twenty seven to UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nOn the age of\n... or the FBI as question to people who according to Christine Blasey Ford we're at a high school party where she says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her that's according to lawyers ... and mark judge is the background investigation into the judge expanded and\nIf you want to fight holier than thou I Am going to call you out on it\nAnd I think eat letting them know they're in for a rough spot and over\nWhile they're all that look the one thing we know about politicians most of them\nI wouldn't put McCain in this category I didn't like his politics domestically but he was pretty strong in his position he was not easily intimidated but these other guys the urban you couldn't you could blow 'em over with a with a fly\nA Blumenthal same thing right I [noise] you know and they took on Feinstein today to 'em about the ... you know about the leak what about that\nAbout signing up tiny spy that was working or why\nAll that too but he was talking about the leak today that must have been from her office\nWell there are a lot of things going on right now but I think what do you think knowing if if you're going to fight this way I'm going to fight this way back in other words he's not backing off he's not going to be out out a ... than that he's got a plus or get Brett Kavanaugh uh uh you know\nBy the Senate ain't gonna do it relatively but he's not going to allow this to go on indefinitely because that's what the Democrats want they want to keep him from getting the nomination through\nOh wait take fan at all what they want and then uh therefore they never get another point the\nAs McConnell gave a statement today on the floor of the Senate I guess they're all during their time now in order to fulfill the obligations of the rules\nAnd be able to vote quickly when the FBI is done um I didn't hear the whole thing I heard portions of it but he was he was you know condemning the Democrats but there is he going to have the chutzpah the temerity the you know what\nTo say we're voting after everybody gets their legal time under Senate rules what is it thirty hours um do you think he has the chutzpah to say we're voting and then the struck them down from their ridiculous rhetoric Harry Reid would have would live Mitch McConnell do it on the other side\nI think he will but he's going to do have to follow the rules of the Senate and the the main concern I Would have is the fact that won the FBI delivers the report it maybe a thousand pages of the baby to about eight is going to be some sort of review by senators\nBefore they actually vote is don't\nHand it to them and then take boat so I don't know what time is going to be in this case and how much can accelerate bad after all\nWell ... that's a good point but we already know the Democrats are voting for him um and we\nKnow that I mean but the question is following the procedures and the protocols that it that that is not right protocol but he's gonna he's gonna do it in the minimum amount of time possible but we don't know precisely and we can't find tune it to the hour\nAnd um I've never seen anything like Jeff Flake ... he he's a flight I mean it's a perfect ...\nHe they they pay him he's [laughter] he's ... he's acting\nLike a flake he's acting life he has no gumption\nOr no you know what no ... no a stand up and be counted type of guy he gets blown over by everybody\nAnd you know the woman who stopped them in the elevator uh it would have been easy to say look I've I have great\nEmpathy for your victimization but judge Kavanaugh didn't do that\nOr the story that's been told and because the woman asked them the believer and my answer would be I Believe she believes it and I believe something happened but I don't believe those judge Kavanaugh because none of the story measures together properly he didn't even stand up to orange who's not even old from Connecticut\nNow I don't I mean Arizona in his case Arizona yeah\nRight I I don't understand him at all because he's not lame duck I mean what difference does it make if he votes with the president boats with conservative most to be elected that there are there why not vote for conservative or\nIt just makes no sense whatsoever but they allowed some ah astro turf activists to take them down a ridiculous\nBy the way the president pointed out that in high school and and I I'm I'm convinced he never had anything to drink is older brother Fred\nWas his biggest influence on that I write on that and I'm not moral I think about it if he did it doesn't bother me but he didn't and um and I believe that fully and um when it came to Kavanaugh\nThe president made the point when he went to high school everybody around them was breaking it was the thing to do um so what's the big deal\nAnd are you gonna are you going to knock the guy down because he drank in high school how about the alcoholics that have presently on the United States Senate shall we draw them out of office\nYou know I think there's there's no question that this is not an issue eight ... this is strictly political ideological maybe they don't want another conservative on the rain or do you remember I predicted rate is for America for a book\nThat there was going to be a super majority of conservative\nCourt and from term [noise] we're on the mark in that\nCorrect Kavanaugh's one war and that ... they don't want that to happen and they're going to try to stop it any way they can do it ... it has nothing to do is wait a minute had nothing to do with anything right and I our [noise]\nYou're absolutely right and by the way the next one when madam Justice Ginsburg retires that is going to be out there to be

station\n... has heart radio station [noise]\nMike Segal here have you with us Dr Gerard will Merrill is with us as well as we get back to our conversation dot com era we go to Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren according to my uh\nSources and Massachusetts um couple of host I've known over the years a Jeff corner and I'm highly car fare or our very very big supporters of a Jeff deal who I've interviewed as I said and I'm told\nThat he's um maybe is already doing it I'm not they're following the race but he's going to be out there if he hasn't already and I'm sure he is a calling her out as being basically a smog aristocrat who was very well off lots of money\nAnd pretends to be a socialist or in other words for the common folk she's no different\nThan the banks and people she criticizes the in other words the wealthy crowd she's one of them\nThan uh you know right now ah various pundits and Washington just get the fate automatically to Elizabeth Warren but it's interesting and they gave it to or by a wide margin but for you know\nAnd and yet a there is some dynamic going on there that may surprise you all this race may turn out a lot closer than people think right now\nAnd so I'm forecasting it to come in a lot closer and I don't know if uh he could lose there's an outside chance right now but the dynamics are not going and hurt the rats\nAnd by by the way I think that's the reason why she made her speech uh recently I think it's because of the dynamics changing and also the fact that some of her own and Fox part it was for example who might run at twenty twenty however you want it he wanted to get a little airtime\nWell that while wall and good to get air time as the politicians do fair but but I mean he's going to call her out as basically being a phoney\nThat she's living this posh life she lied to get it\nI guess on the left wing lying is or what you do Blumenthal we mentioned earlier Corey Booker with his sexual abuse of a woman\nWhich he admitted to by the way uh idols with Warren and being won a Native American pretending to be Native American they get a job at Harvard where she made a ton of money for doing basically no work\nAnd she refuses to take a DNA test\nFerry what what's your background is a ... that that I I mean that's what seemed to me to be something that would get people is if you want to talk about somebody missed portraying themselves falsely portraying themselves why are they going after her and instead of going after judge Kavanaugh for example\nWhat do you see those reasons that they're very reasons why some of the dynamic that some of the variables are moving against or\nBecause this is a time period where the American people are really turned off on Washington Polk he's an incumbent and one that uh\nIt is associated with a party that a lot of American voters have problems with because of the way they're treating Cavanaugh I mean you know keep us saying hey look my thought it could be my father you know we can't live\nWhere people are you know are guilty assumed guilty instead of innocent until proven guilty but you have a lot of um\nA fat or use the word fat that are changing some of these dynamic where Elizabeth Warren and you would think would automatically when easily in ...\nIt's odd things are moving against her now\nWell they move enough it depends on the opponent and whether he does a good job but\nThere are a lot of people ... voted against her\nWhile I think he's going to do a good job and we'll see if it resonates with the people there because we can show themselves to be not radical political on the issues I'm a but a reasonable guy\nHe could very well have a shot and and uh they intend to go out to to win this thing I mean I Know the campaign and the candidate are intending to go out to win this thing so we'll see how it all\nI think I was at the results are going to be a surprise I don't know how close the final will be but I'm trying to do my updated forecast both the house and the Senate this week but right now I Would still give it to her but I think that the because the variables are moving against or I think he could still lose\nAll right fair enough so let's go to I'm just a couple of examples Joe Donnelly and Indiana he said he was voting against judge Kavanaugh then over the week that was ... and late last week than he backed off on that over the weekend because he got inundated from people in Indiana\nWho thought he was out of his mind for doing that a voting against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so then he backed off on that so who knows where it's going to vote but what do you make of his race and the same thing with the north Dakota uh and and the the question becomes what and Joe mansion um what is the\nTipping point on these people voting\nOut at the the the cabinet vote being a tipping point for these elections in these for swing states so to speak\nRight now right now the Democrats are losing about Seventy five thousand I'm Sorry twenty five thousand votes per week day\nOh with the Kavanaugh situation on the news stories that are running a it's playing against the Democrats can't right now I think high camp lose I think ... gonna lose I think Claire McCaskill we're going to lose and\nDonnelly is on the front\nSo they're all going to vote against a Kevin audience thank Heidi Heitkamp and Donnelly and McCaskill McCaskill I think that she's going to vote against them to\nI Can't say how they're going to vote I'm just telling you how I think they're going to wind up in their election\nSo they're all going to lose\n... is the is the president's going to have an effect on that has been the west Virginia\nYeah he's been to Indiana for that matter yeah yeah absolutely can can ... it really even that a lot while the um uh he was way ahead though at one point one thing\nThey want those early yeah he was the head but the\nThe dynamics are are working against them that dynamic electro a model or working\nAgainst them because it's just the\nYou know the way that voters are failing right now\nKeith Ellison has not responded to requests for comment about keeping us alive\n\nAnd the uh\nPeople in Minneapolis Minneapolis city attorney Susan Segal no relation to me says she got an email late today from the from that was carrying out the investigation\n\nAnd so we will see how this all plays out\nThey're not going to use the Minneapolis attorney's office\nBecause Keith Ellison son is in Minneapolis city council member so therefore there would be a conflict adventurous I mean obviously if a if the accused son is on the city council Minneapolis that could become a problem\nConflict of interest that he could use his influence to protect his father so they're going to find a different prosecutors offers office\nTo do a response\nAnd or an investigation if that's appropriate that's what we're that stands a but the woman who was hired cannot substantiate the claim but they want to send it to a police agency and Keith Ellison should be under the gun under the microscope\nUnder the investigation for what was uh the allegations against him which was very very serious by the way if you want to talk about a serious allegation that certainly was one\nNancy Pelosi remember her\nI I have a hard time understanding why she hangs on the way she does the woman is Seventy eight she's got plenty of money by the way she has a fence around our house\nYes she doesn't want a fence for the American sovereign territory to be protected as a nation\nAnd\nShe's not talking about being speaker again\n\nI think there are ... that just that fact alone\nShould cause people to want to get out and vote and I bring it up because there's been talk that the Democrats are energized and all I've got to say is the Republicans better get energized if you're not because you can't leave one vote sitting on the sidelines\nYou know if you're the the baseball playoffs are going on right now\nAnd\nWere two games today we're teams tied exactly tied after a hundred and sixty two games they play they both have the same record\nA Chicago Cubs play the Milwaukee Brewers and the Colorado Rockies play the Los Angeles Dodgers and there were winners of those games and the winners became the champions of their divisions and the other two teams have to play in a wild card game\nTomorrow night Tuesday night\nBut the thing about that and and any sport football whatever it may be basketball hockey the question is\nFor those athletes did you leave everything on the field on the court on the ice wherever that you'll leave everything there did you hold back anything\nThat might have cost your team to victory and I've seen guys for example hit a ball a long way in baseball and they think it's a home run so they don't run very fast they just try and then all of a sudden\nThe ball hits the fence stays in the ... on the field and now they might wind up on a double when they should have wound up with a triple\nOr they might wind up with a single one they should have wound up with a double if they just run as they're supposed to\nThat's where I mean by leaving it all on the field but you did everything you could to win and that's what I'm saying to Republican voters and independent voters this is a crucial time and you got Nancy Pelosi saying she's going to be speaker\nMy answer to that as you people out there have got to change that because uh she speaker forget about the next two years she'll block everything from getting done everything nothing will get the\nShe'll probably doing a peach middle of the president\nAnd just tie up the entire country\nWhile we're doing so well now if she if she gets control of the house\nIt's going to be curtains it's going to be chaos\nAnd is going to reverse all of the gains we have made everything the Trump is done and these two years\nYou can be assured will be reversed in the next two years if she's speaker\nAnd there's plenty of time now to understand that that you need to get out there and vote he needs to get out there and be part of the process\nYou need to not sit home\nIt isn't enough to just have voted for Donald Trump for example now you need to make sure that what he has accomplished that he's accomplished a huge amount\nWe don't even have the time on the program now and I wouldn't take the time because you know with all these issues are to talk about everything NAFTA today was a good example ... gone and now it's the new U.S MCA agreement\nAnd it's a better deal for the United states the NAFTA ever was\nAnd so many other things that have happened the XO pipeline the Dakota access pipeline opening up\nAnwar the Alaskan National wildlife refuge for for oil I mean that's the only the surface of the steel companies coming back the coal industry coming back manufacturing jobs coming back more jobs than people now in this country\nYou want that to continue you know there's a price to pay\nAnd the price to pay his participation in the system\nAnd none of this is going to continue with Nancy Pelosi become speaker she thinks she will\nWe have to stop that and\nHave a midterm election when now most of the time through our history when a president wins an election for four years the mid term election two years later typically\nGoes to the other party [noise] we can't let that happen at other times it may not have been as costly now it would be hugely costs you look at what the Democrats are doing as the minority party can you imagine what they would try to do\nIf they got the majority so good

which converge semi automatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns but no action even President Trump made a promise we're\nAnd I think eat letting them know they're in Prague raw bought in ... oh\nWell there are ... that look for one thing we know about politicians most of them\nI wouldn't put McCain in this category I didn't like his politics domestically but he was pretty strong in his position he was not easily intimidated but these other guys\nUrban you can you could blow 'em over with a with a fly a Blumenthal same thing right I ... you know and they took on Feinstein today to 'em about the ... you know about the leak but what about that\nAbout the tiny all about the Chinese by that was working or as well as\nAll that too but he was talking about the leak today that must have had from her office\nRight well there are a lot of things going on right now but I think\nBig knowing if you're going to fight this way I'm going to fight this way back in other words he's not backing off is not going to be out out by the fact that he's going to push forward it get Brett Kavanaugh uh uh you know\nOh by the Senate ain't gonna do it relatively but he's not going to allow this to go on indefinitely because that's what the Democrats want they want to keep him from getting the nomination through all white take spin it a whole which they won't and then uh therefore he never get another point the\nIs McConnell gave us a statement today on the floor of the Senate I guess they're all during their time now in order to fulfill the obligations of the rules\nAnd be able to vote quickly when the FBI is done um I didn't hear the whole thing our portions of it\nBut he was he was you know condemning the Democrats but there is he going to have the chutzpah the temerity the you know what\nTo say we're voting after everybody gets their legal time under Senate rules what is it thirty hours um do you think he has the chutzpah to say we're voting and then the struck them down from their ridiculous rhetoric\nHarry Reid would have would lip Mitch McConnell do it on the other side\nI think he will but he's going to do have to follow the rules of the Senate and the the main concern I Would have if the fact\nThat won the FBI delivers the report it maybe a thousand pages of baby two thousand eight is this going to have to be some sort of review by senators before they actually vote they just don't\nHand it to them and then take boat so I don't know what time period going to be in this case and how much can accelerate bad after all a\n... that's a good point but we already know the Democrats are voting for him um and do\nWe know that I mean what the question is following the procedures and the protocols of the Senate that that is not their protocol but he's gonna he's gonna do it in the minimum amount of time off the ball but we don't know precisely that we can fine tune it to the hour\nI've never seen anything like Jeff Flake\nIs he he's a flight I mean it's a perfect ...\nHe they they pay him he's he's he's acting\nLike a flake he's acting like he has no gumption or no you know what no tomorrow already know was stand up and be counted type of guy he gets blown over by everybody\nAnd you know the woman who stopped him in the elevator uh it would have been easy to say look I've I have great\nEmpathy for your victimization\nBut judge Kavanaugh didn't do that a story that's been told\nAnd because the woman asked them the believer and my answer would be I Believe she believes it and I believe something happened but I don't believe those judge Kavanaugh because none of the story measures together properly he didn't even stand up to orange who's not even old from Connecticut\n[noise] no I don't I mean Arizona in his case Arizona yeah\nRight I I don't understand him at all because he's not lame duck I mean what difference does it make if he votes with the president boats with conservative seems to be elected as to why not vote for conservative ah\n... it just makes no sense whatsoever that allowed some by astro turf activists who take them down\nBy the way the president pointed out of high school and then I I'm I'm convinced he never had anything to drink is older brother Fred was his biggest influence on that I\nWrite on that and I'm not ... about it if he did it doesn't bother me but he didn't\nAnd um and I believe that fully and I'm the one that came to Kavanaugh\nThe president made the point when he went to high school everybody around them was breaking it was the thing to do um so what's the big deal and are you gonna are you going to knock the guy down because he drank in high school how about the alcoholics that I'm presently on the United States Senate shall we draw them out of office right\nYou know I think there's there's no question that this is not an issue again this is strictly political ideological and they don't want another conservative on the brain or do you remember I predicted rate is for America if book\nThat there was going to be a super majority of conservative\nCourt in from term [noise] we're on the barn in that correct Kavanaugh's\nOne war and that ... they don't want that to happen and they're going to try to stop but any way they can to hit something to do it ... it has nothing to do is wait a minute had nothing to do with anything right then ideology [noise] you're absolutely right\nBy the way the next one when madam Justice Ginsburg retires that is going to be out there to be there's a woman conservative that they will never be able to stop the even the

conversation dot com era we go to\nMassachusetts Elizabeth Warren according to my uh\nSources in Massachusetts um couple of host I've known over the years a Jeff corner and um\nHow we car sharing or our very very big supporters of\nA Jeff deal who I've interviewed as I said and I'm told that he's um maybe is already doing it I'm not they're following the race but he's going to be out there the hasn't already and I'm sure he is a calling her out as being basically a smog aristocrat\nWho's very well off lots of money and pretends to be a socialist or in other words for the common folk she's no different than the banks and people she criticizes the in other words the wealthy crowd she's one of them\n... ...\nAh you know right now uh various pundits and Washington just shift the fate automatically Elizabeth Warren but it's interesting and they gave it to or by a wide margin but for now\nAnd yet a there is some dynamic going on there that may surprise ... all of this race may turn out a lot closer\nThan people think right now\nAnd so on forecasting it come in a lot closer and I don't know if ah she could lose they're outside cats right now but the dynamics are not going in her direct\nAnd by by the way I think that's the reason why she made her speech uh recently I think it's because of the dynamics king king and also the fact that some of her opponent bikes part it was for example for my son is twenty twenty however you want it he wanted to get a little airtime\nWell that while wall and good to get airtime is the politicians do fair but but\nI mean he's going to call her out as basically being a phoney that she's living this posh life she lied to get it\nI guess on the left wing lying is or what you do Blumenthal we mentioned earlier Corey Booker with his sexual abuse of a woman\nWhich he admitted to by the way I was with Warren and being won a Native Americans pretending to be Native American they get a job at Harvard where she made a ton of money for doing basically no work\nAnd she refuses to take a DNA test\nFerry what uh what's your background is a ... that that I mean that's what seemed to me to be something that would get people is if you want to talk about somebody missed portraying themselves falsely portraying themselves why are they going after her and instead of going after judge Kavanaugh for example\nWhat do you see those reasons they're very reasons why some of the dynamic that some of the variables are moving against or because this is a time period where the American people are really turned off on Washington folks he's an incumbent and one that uh\nIs is associated with a party that a lot of American voters have problems with because of the way they're treating Cavanaugh I mean you know people are saying hey look it could be my thought it could be my father you know we can't live\nWhere people are you know are guilty assume guilt instead of innocent until proven guilty but you have a lot of um\n[noise] a set for use the word fat that are changing some of these dynamics where Elizabeth Warren you would think would or wouldn't easily in Massachusetts uh things are moving against her\nWill they move enough it depends on the opponent and whether he does a good job but there are a lot of people accused of that will vote against her\nWhile I think he's going to do a good job and we'll see if it resonates with the people there because he can show themselves to be not radical political on the issues I'm a but a reasonable guy\nHe could very well have a shot and and uh they intend to go out to to win this thing I mean I Know the campaign and the candidate are intending to go out to win this thing so we'll see how it all\nComes at the results\nWe're going to be a surprise I don't know how close the final will be but I'm trying to do my updated forecast both the house and the Senate this week but right now I Would still give it to her but I think that the because the variables that moving against or I think she could still lose\nAll right fair enough so let's go to I'm just a couple of examples Joe Donnelly in Indiana he said he was voting against judge Kavanaugh then over the weekend that was ... and late last week then he backed off on that over the weekend because he got inundated from people in Indiana\nWho thought he was out of his mind for doing that a voting against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so then he backed off on that so who knows where it's going to vote but what do you make of his race and the same thing with the north Dakota uh and and the the question becomes what an angel mansion um what is the\nTipping point on these people voting out at the the the cabinet vote being a tipping point for these elections and these swing states so to speak\nRight now right now the Democrats are losing about Seventy five thousand I'm Sorry twenty five thousand votes per week day\nWith the Kavanaugh situation on the news stories that are running it's playing against the Democrats Kansas right now I think ... I think it's going to lose I think Claire McCaskill we're gonna lose Donnelly is on the front\nSo they're all going to vote against a Kevin audience thank Heidi Heitkamp in Donnelly and McCaskill McCaskill says she's gonna vote against him too\nI Can't say how they're going to vote I'm just telling you how I think they're going to wind up in the election\nSo they're all going to lose is the is the president's going to have an effect on that has been the west Virginia yeah he's been to Indiana for that matter\nYeah yeah absolutely ... ... it's really been a lot\nWhile the um uh he was way ahead though at one point wasn't he\nHe was also yeah he was ahead but the the dynamics are are working against them the dynamic electro a model or working against them because it's just the\nYou know the way that voters they're failing right now\nThan what what are the Democrats going to do because if if what you said comes true and the election\nComes down to I'm a Republican win", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "02"}
