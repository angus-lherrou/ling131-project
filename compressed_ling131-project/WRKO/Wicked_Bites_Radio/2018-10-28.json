thing same there from places different name toy or can be a fidelity grow fun and uh you know in vanguard growth\nKind of like going to stop and shop and buying a red delicious apple and then you get back in your car you wasting gas and you make you know voice now twenty minutes to go to different supermarket and you buy the same red delicious apple\nAnd they haven't rebound step portfolio in the last ten years because the market has done nothing but going up in those ten years so all of a sudden they harvested all these games and now here we are witnessing involved all in uncertain times\nIn all of a sudden dip their portfolio might be dropping quicker than what their risk tolerance is really\nSet at so they became aggressive rather than moderate or conservative\nSo they need to re balanced portfolio so it's great when the market goes up when you become unbalanced and the market goes up great but when the market starts to correct itself and start the show signs of uncertainty then you start seeing that account dropping much quicker than you probably are willing to take on ...\nAnd that's when people really wished they followed our two rules ruined number one just don't lose the money and rule number two don't forget rule number one you know I think John you put it very well that's the difference between\nKnowing what you have understanding why this is going to

dollars a month\nI kinda find myself worry and at the end of the month every month so I think I Need like thirty five hundred Ken my money my retirement plan would stand that we had a conversation we made some changes and\nYou know and they say you know she signed a form and she's getting thirty five hundred dollars a month but she knew she was going to be able to do that because it wasn't just hoping it was going to be OK having a ... advisor relationship like she has with us and just knowing that she can reach out and you know get some answers yeah\nAnd you go through a study with her a test with her to let her know you know Ken that withstand it and what is the ... was like what can it can or cannot\nAnybody is listening right now if you have questions about what John just talked about what we just talked about\nWhat our processes and how do you go from\nWhile I saved a lot of money to knowing that the money that I've saved is going to last me a lifetime give us a call if you

clients were formed of what's going on what's happening with their accounts so we're very proactive but\nWe do sit down with my clients no less than once a year for an annual review take a look at the portfolio are we still aren't tracked so these portfolios and these this plan that we put together isn't something that we we put together than we throw it on the shelf and forget about it\nWe men and Julie massage that plan on a yearly basis things happen changes happen\nThat's absolutely right joined I think you are absolutely correct to say that being proactive is better than being reactive of course but also is the relationship that you have right now and maybe you don't even have a relationship or those people capable sort of helping you not only today\nBut for many years to come you know when I built this company my partner my regional partners Richard but you know we built this company almost Thirty years ago and we had sort of a vision in mind\nTo say hey look you know people need this they need that they need there's things in between why don't we build a company that we cannot cater to everybody but those new retirement to have\nTheir money protected to have their income source known\nTo have their assets they house protective for their family if God Forbid something were to happen in between and the nursing home how do we how we solve that problem we built a company

numbers in actually redo this three sixty five retiring play we actually redo it and we implement those changes on a as needed basis ...\nMet a guy the other day um his daughter got divorced and it was messy one now she's back home and we have to change their plan 'cause he needed to spend more money basically supporting the daughter and the grandchildren so like you said John things change
