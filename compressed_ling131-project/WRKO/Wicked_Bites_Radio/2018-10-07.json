one one hundred and one years\nOf being around and Terry joining us right now you're located in need of I I Know you know that but I tell everybody a little bit about how the farm actually got started over a hundred years ago Derek\n[noise] right well thanks a lot for having me on first of all thank you ate and wanting us and\nSo my brother than I our fourth generation and uh the farm and so our great grandfather started it back in Nineteen Seventeen so Latin you're at the man and we had our hundred year anniversary and it was kind of neat because he got to go through our whole family history they got some really cool photos and put it together and it\nOften cookbook that we just put out so it has like a whole bunch of history to it and each chapter and then all different you know he's not in that we love from our family and and also from our farm kitchen here\nIt's sort of amazing that a farm you know as lasted a particularly here in New England for over a hundred years at this point\nYeah it's kind of um I mean there there used to be a lot more of us obviously [laughter] um no but we're just really protests are the community that we are and it's so incredibly supportive and it's such a mutual mutually beneficial relationship and it's just it's so great to be where we are here and eat them\nIn a chicken anything fresher and and even when you buy like produce in the wintertime you know to go to your arms and because you know what you're looking for right\nSo I mean that's always been kind of our allies now that I'm On a farm and opened up and twenty twelve so now we're on open year round you never used to be true and I were carrying credit the around and um especially with the ...\nAnd it's always been kind of our challenge you know like our our goals and make people want to come here even in the winter we know that you can go to different markets and we know a lot of people want to do one stop shopping you've got everything they can possibly need you know and they're toilet paper and stuff like that you know at the market um but we need to stay\nYou know as a place where you can't get the quality of where you would be able to get here so we're our quality of though it's not and then our kitchen in our deli ended up in you around as well and so I think that brings people in 'cause it's just like ... and unique Neal\nHome that didn't need fresh mean constantly are our staff is working all the time\nEspecially for a year round for 'em you gotta be turning it out constantly\nYeah so especially around the holidays to get you know raising 'em I yeah I'm a better voice and all it is it's really special\nThat we post on our website ... ... you know some things are are like brand new and then they'll have some that stick around seasonally as a special and they're just so good\n[laughter] I mean we're just about to get into the holiday season and I have a feeling or your farm stand you have a lot of holiday gifts so great house woman gifts and all those those gifts to that you could bring in a bring as you're just going on so absolutely especially\nThis time of year we have some gorgeous you know like plants and stuff and our greenhouse food and in the spring we really do a crazy you know the whole amount of you know homegrown um\nYou know we start feed ourselves we do the whole nine yards and our greenhouse in in a it's really the time to go and walk through because it's unbelievable how many flowers are moving at the same time in there and um and then well get closer to like the holiday season we um have a whole Christmas gift shop down in the greenhouse\nThat my mom and I go and shop for in Atlanta every year so it's kind of a big family tradition for ethic how to do that and then we sell Christmas trees in the race and all that kind of stuff mhm I'm as well as all the food for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Hanukah and all that good stuff\nHave you noticed and I and I guess this is sort of just me kind of looking back in just sensing it it seems to me like the springs take a lot longer to get going with the falls seem to last longer and has that affected the the the way things grow\nYeah so it's it's funny because I'm specifically now right now under a tent we had and twenty have\nSorry we have a twenty six twenty twenty seven varieties of Apple's under there and they're all locally grown\nSo a lot of them are like unbelievable they've never tasted discovered that then a couple of varieties that are that were earlier variety mhm since it was warm kinda late you'll notice that they weren't as flavorful as as normal so I mean there are still great and they're still fresh and wonderful but\nIt depends on if everything very much depends on the weather like that\nOh yeah and it just seems like it's been shifting we're we're we're staying warm longer and I think I like that myself [laughter]\nMaybe we can make it into January sometime I'd be really really happy and I like cold a lot to dance all winter winter we wouldn't mind that jury would you\nNot so much we know we can do without\n... I'm sure you get a little bit of a break for you [laughter] you could ... yeah I mean obviously when we used\nTo close we used to get more of a break but now [laughter] now it's uh it's nice to have a slightly slow season every once in a while [laughter]\nYeah uh but you know a lot of events that you do it at the farms to end at the farm too\nWe do and I'm really glad you asked about that 'cause next weekend is our apple pie baking contest and it is a ton of fun so anybody can sign up to do it last year a kid one I think he was ten I don't even remember and so he so when you when when you get the ... the next year with our other judge at\nTen you want it [laughter] what was that a ten year old wanted\nYeah with his brother so they're they're judging their whenever they're going to act as one of our judges is air\nYouthful judge ... nation restaurant route one ten twelve hours for street in April\nAnd then by the way I saw this because kids on\nThursday and you know it was a beautiful Thursday nights it infringed ... who's on site if it were all excited I'm sure that if it's um well they can only open for dinner the restaurant Sunday they open up the air [noise]\nAnd I think they're like to say dreams Saturday they open up at Fort ... in Dallas\nWhere to go come on you've always wanted to get by TV Facebook Google Plus it's winter you are listening to wicked by ... the voice of Boston\nGame day of a lazy to us from our famous they way you are award winning Ruben verb a special\nMonday through friday batting a jet three Ninety five\nWe'd are quality for our price one odd in LA for five right boat and by\nHand Woodley here and I want to celebrate at an anniversary a very special anniversary of one hundred years\nYou know where the NO NAME or extra\nFifteen fish beer in the seaport area in Boston is the only restaurant in the and the seaport area that has free parking yes or Nineteen Seventeen when it opened up and they've got to be doing something right you'll get boils cried you can get a boiled smells you can get a\nYou know what you should try that seafood chowder it's so so good it's important when you go to the no\nName restaurant to say hey Jimmy ...
