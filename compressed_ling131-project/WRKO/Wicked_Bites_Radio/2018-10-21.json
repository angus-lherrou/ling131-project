{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Doubt imagine the retirement for two years and you just been riding a wave yeah you know my guy over at ABC company says you know things are never going to change and I'm ... percent a year and I'm just you know living high and and enjoying life and then all of a sudden last couple of weeks and like oh boy what's gonna happen now you'd be a little nervous about that absolutely\nSo guys I Want to talk to those folks that have done a great job of saving for their retirement and you know they see retirement on the horizon right now but they look back at last week would happen and there are a little afraid but then again you know they see and hear all the messages\nAre out there these workshops against Saturday October twenty seven special workshop day by the way a note Saturday ... exactly and you guys listen to people and they wanted a Saturday So there you go and\nThen Tuesday October thirtieth those are the workshop dates here in the month of October this is a great environment for people to come in and kind of ... their toe and really get some great information without a and you guys are good about this without really feeling a lot of pressure that they had to do something\nWell that's why we go to these workshops their attended by you know forty fifty sometimes a hundred people and you if you want to be shy you can sit in the back but you were going to give you a lot of great information you sort of can take a first brush it hey maybe I haven't done this so I've done a good job ... who knows\nBut it's an opportunity for people to get more educated and again let me just shut up those dates Saturday October twenty seventh\nWill be in debt him and Tuesday October thirtieth will be will burn and if you want more information you can you do need to sign up you need your reservation go straight to our website I just don't lose the money dot com again it's just don't lose the money dot com\nSame I got to interrupt you here because I I spoke with Bobby as of late and and there's a limited amount of seats are remaining yeah so they got to\nGo to just don't lose the money dot com very quickly and as the ones at twelve o'clock at night so I think people are trying to sneak on and their lunch hour and work maybe yeah so again just don't lose the money dot com where you can come to learn more about what you need to do in retirement you know we were talking about the perfect storm of opportunity but also Mike I think one thing we want to bring up is\nA lot of times people don't have an exit strategy [laughter] yeah I sat down with someone last week a Sam and they had they actually were retired and they had a million dollars and therefore all and K and they were just planning on withdrawing a four percent I said well what happens if in four percent was forty thousand a year should I\nSee what happens if the market dropped ... percent at four percent becomes thirty six thousand dollars what are you gonna do that that's not enough or getting close to the point where it's not enough right they didn't really think like some soil is that right well you if you want the forty\nThousand now you have to draw out more than four percent I remember I I met these people maybe like ten years ago and\nIt was a situation where there was nothing that I could do they came in and they said look you know we've got a million bucks just like your example ride we need to take out forty thousand dollars a year they're broken tells them hey no problem you know we've done quite well and the market's done you know eight percent on average you know I've done even a better job you've earned even a little bit more no problem\nWith the problem was they retired in two thousand and for the next three years the market went down\nAnd down and down but they still need to pay their bills\nSo they're drawing a forty thousand dollars a year for three years in a row and by the time they came to us they had like five hundred and fifty thousand bucks\nAnd now they need to trial forty thousand dollars in five fifty right you know I'll be on the spot what's that ... percent yes just shy and that's like a nine percent nine percent withdrawal rate and you know what no matter what you do is not going to work for an extended period of time so you don't really want to put yourself in that position and that's the whole idea of understanding\nAuctions understanding\nA allocation models for as you grow the money understanding what Reagan's our retirement income generators now you can diversify income source and really having an extraction plan you know we met some folks the other day for review their clients of ours different kinds of our so maybe ten twelve years\nHe's a dentist by trade successful practice but he's a solo practitioner and he said to me saying you know I'm like four years away from retirement you've done a pretty good job with this stuff to help me understand what I'm going to get income from\nBut my my business is worth a lot of money\nAnd now I'm taking a steps to bringing new partners I'm looking at different options and maybe some of my business or maybe bringing in a junior partner and I can I can take a reduced role and maybe less make less money but also income coming in he's thinking about an exit strategy not like the month before he retired\nI was just thinking about an exit strategy five years before he wants to retire sure so that's the whole idea for folks that you know work for some corporation you don't just not sure if work one day and think the rest of your twenty Thirty years is going to be fine you have to have a plan of attack\nSo saying let's talk about that plan of attack and and again I Want to remind everyone listening or now about the uh five steps to a successful retirement workshop that's coming up Saturday October twenty seven denim Hilton in debt them and then Tuesday October thirtieth crown plaza in

pressure you know you can really dip your does your mind to Russia and and and really see what's going to work best for you and get some great information but there's a lot of\nI guess middle class millionaires\nOut there that have done a great job of saving money again next door\nYou know they paid two hundred and eighty thousand also they houses now with seven fifty they saved and therefore when Kay for thirty five years now it's worth a million bucks and they have you know five hundred grand bank\nRight part of that problem is you know in the ... and they've had you know ten different

halfway\nDone laying down the new pipes in the area and right out in front of our office today you know 'cause we're we're right along the the ... about two weeks ago out here and you know they're still going is still going and it is yeah and they're replacing all the pipes there\nAre places in Andover still closed include Palmer's ... you know are still don't have an open date for them to a ... square oyster company same issue ... or ... nothing really there\nI don't know about a ... pizza in Lawrence with some of the Lawrence places it's hard to find out I I tried to get an update from

just had a gas power everything back\nMe I actually said things getting at least ... they have like four three or four I Know of like like basically trailer parks that they they brought in now yeah so at least people are warm at night\nIf yeah something warm ... warm shower\nI I Know some people that have been her hotel ever said from day one and yeah and the problem is a their insurance was paying for it for like thirty days you know ... yeah exactly so now they're on their own they went to a different hotel\nBecause they haven't read that I think they got two hundred dollars from the gas company so far that'll help and the problem is when you're living in a hotel\n... it's not like living at home or even if they're renting an apartment or your food costs go up because you have to eat out more often right on yeah right you can't like just go the microwave throw something you're Mike what why they can't do that so [noise]\nIt it's a struggle but you know we're fighting now way through it and we're hoping that it does start to clear up yeah and these restaurants get back ah in plenty of time for the holidays and of course yeah my concern right now I mean that's the hope yeah hope but route twenty eight and end or is my concern right now ... that really concerns me\nA bullet we'll see we'll keep you up to want to take the folks last night then joined us Joey voices yeah speaking of route twenty eight we're on route twenty north reading yes about a mile and a half from all the problems and they say we're fine\nOr a ... and they were they were hopping last night and Joyce is put on a show that just you know while the crowd of course she didn't you know it it it was what he does I had a couple of friends that that decided last minute they wanted to see Joe in an income and they've never seen it before I didn't realize that ...\nAnd they just absolutely love them cool they thought he was this therapy they were they were they were choosing between us and seen some like eighties\nBand ... laying in like marble that\nThey were definitely in the cover song mood\n[laughter] okay Joe he just did all the covers yeah last night\nI was sort of seeing one eighties band they saw forty idle multiple generations\nWow yes go all the with a smile and laugh at your 'cause that's what you do then a hell of a meal like right now there's a great must've won yeah or they have a buffet going for us ... which was which is really nice you know like a rice and there was a\nA sausage and pepper dish which I I mean that to me that's a lot better yeah they they had the one of their Mac and cheese dishes ... yes I Am currently and she is yeah they're they're famous for their Mac and cheese dishes or I don't know if those ... says well\nJay Jay is Jeff and yeah he he's he's his claim to fame is is he claims to have invented the lobster Mac and cheese a Joe fish\nAnd a ... and the Mac and cheese itself even without the lobster is phenomenal that he makes their out a little bit of lobster more good or I'm enjoying it [laughter] yeah that's all I'm sure he brought his same recipe over those Lobos and they they had that was that was part of the buffet as well\nYeah there was rice and a couple of other I only had a couple of things I didn't really go through the phone\nYou were holding out for the Charles [laughter] Barry delete here who are holding out for sure it was\nWhat's wrong with having like you know like a a fried dough basically covered in sending with chocolate dipping sauce no judgment ceremony nothing wrong with that I have not at all either it was it was fun I got it you know I went outside the show but of course I enjoy like a thousand times if I miss the song it to\nYou I'm a I I'm going to not even realize I missed that at this point\n[laughter] you've forgotten more about Julie voices in the most people know [laughter]\nYes yes yes but you know I sat out there and I looked at all there to kill us because they have\nOr one hundred hundred of these yep yep and they're they're some of them or find tequila oh we're there will be a little bit I never knew where I never knew anything about the killers I until I sat down with the gym dates up at his restaurant us Lobos about oh about a year ago\nAnd he knows a thing or two about thing or two\nYeah [laughter] and he taught me how to first of all drank it right I just thought you just shot at by yeah no no you don't\nScott's it's done with a hundred or a glass of tequila like where's the salt in line [laughter]\nCollege girl come to you know oh my God [laughter]\nI I learned I learned at that moment yeah well\nI always thought there was like a warm enough to kill it but I guess [laughter] you know yeah [laughter] and every every so often you see those stories and I saw at the other day about peer ... because of global warming there's going to be a beer shorter sure because we had a hops grow\nThere it's too warm or whatever it is it to call I don't really know [laughter] um yeah I I I I and the price of beer was going to double well I don't\nBelieve that even if that is the case price might go up all its got to be that it's going to be better weather than somewhere else you know the prices might go up let's be honest the alcohol industry is too big to disappear yeah now or what a shortage of beer [laughter]\nI say I would like to kill I also think are ... gonna ... short hair cropped out and the prices you know it's either I'll mark to know [laughter]\nAnd they want to raise the prices come up with a reason\nYeah it's propaganda from the vodka companies [laughter]\nI I saw some place or was was doing their ... and ... they had a special beer I forgot what brand that was I I guess they were founded in like Seventy two or something like that so it's coming up on our anniversary so okay so they have like a Seventy to pack of beer\nOr Neddy ice or are there any daylight one or two yeah but yeah and they're getting a lot of complaints about that promotes Ben ... okay well what's the line for ... here's the thing about that\nBecause as someone who who used to be poor and drink Nettie light and um they are only meant for binge drinking beer is only made forbid nobody sipping ... like it's a fine beer hey thirty pack for six bucks it's meant for binge drinking so I was Seventy two pack\nIs brilliant my only concern is it's going to be like walking back from a liquor store with a suitcase of\nWhat I'm saying my only concern is too doesn't include a final of of course [laughter]\nI can only imagine it's going to be like maybe twenty bucks Seventy two beers a photo horrific it's one of those ... you have a drink about twenty of them get the taste out of your mouth [laughter] okay so you can't remember what you're actually drink is definitely definitely freshman in college\nBeer like it wasn't I I I that's why I couldn't remember\nAnd I never tried that need yeah yeah I've been trying some of those those and I I I don't

leaf it so you got that fick lettuce leaf and they served at the table\nSort of like a ... saying straight out\nAnd they bring the shredded chicken with string beans that's kind of minced up and you take a spoon and you put it in the\nThe iceberg lettuce and roll the lettuce so now it's in like a\nPancake and you bite into him and you get that fresh crunch and the ... the you know the flavors of the shredded chicken ... and the string bean do\nAltogether it's my favorite dish there it's called shredded chicken with string beans but if you can't remember just that the lettuce everybody knows because when I I hear about it\nThe chicken on unless all we know what it is it OK so a couple of weeks ago we were talking about you're you're looking for a place that's going to name something after

[laughter]\nIt was one of those last year we were getting ready for October fest with um [noise]\nOne of the beer providers and we're doing specials and I was making pretzels but I had the ... parental hook short I couldn't figure out the oversized pretzel yeah the general principles you're hanging on the hook that goes out and so I had the hook that we got through a company and I was pretty impatient walk looking at it and looking at it\nTrying to figure out what I can do with it and I had our smoked candy pork belly not just treated as like a meat hook and just hook the thing right on there and\nIt's it's been a\nVery popular thing multi purpose look so yeah exactly and it was absolutely delicious the candy and pork bellies what was the was the sauce I had there\nI was a a house made pineapple Sir Roger oh yeah so it's a little sweet and spicy on evidence has the taste of stuff\nAnd then you brought the board of burnt then yes told me about those over because the coleslaw was delicious I ate them yeah so it's our traditional coal saw that's been made here for twenty three years as long as we've been open and the burdens are just are kind of twist on it of your classic burnt down ...\nWhat we do is we reduced down the barbecue sauce more subtle most candies it mhm so you get like a candy burnt and more than just your typical ... and I'm Sam I noticed that a lot of it was a the sweeter city\nOn a sweeter touches to it is is that a regional thing with the market was that just short touches I'm so sorry Texas style barbecue so it started a sweeter style sauce um let me go within our Carolina's warrior honey mustard based gotcha um sauce but\nWhy did you bring it down the sugar is of the barbecue sauce come out so it gets like sweeter its ... year um flavor and you brought up a brand new item I Believe it was the first one to try this yes so today was the first day we put it on and it was a um wild boar Iraq as an appetizer mhm\nAh so it was a wild boar chop a like a lamb chops ...\nUm and what we did is we made a pumpkin apple ... which we don't really make result over here so it was a little different no I'm just kind of feeling the falls you know vibe today and I'm reduced down a little apple cider and our house habanero sauce yep\nAnd give us so it's a little sweet spicy and then the or Iraq we just thrilled to like you for like lamb chops ... and ... sit down with a little less age on it\nWas delicious and and we were talking off air that uh I Do a hell of fresh boxes yes and one of the ones last week was the result of and I had no idea how ... and as you said what you don't always make Brazil don't understand why because each districts like a half an hour to make a thing and yeah it it's a whole deal\nYeah it was a result it was one of those things in it if you had it all yeah if\nYou hit it and it's it's an amazing thing and if it's lately under and it's a little crunchy and all it's it's definitely an interesting er dish will solve lessen your special menu stepped on a special so now and like we change the specials you once twice three times a depends on\nYou know we'll do all their life that I feel like make an Asian foods day that's going to be so never have a signature dish per se it's just kind of what's your feeling that\nDay and that's one of the things you've done with the menu also not only out of your own twist to it as you you know as you feel whatever you're cooking on specials but also the menu itself has gone from just strictly barbecue\nTo a more as you'd say southern comfort food is reading your menu right yeah so it's more like a southern comfort food with New England twist because we're in New England right and I was I was noticing when you grow up because I Love the open pit concept you guys have advice and county you not only do you get to observe that people eating your food but it's also like uh for show almost for the for the crowd yeah I mean it's huge nowadays\nI'm like I worked at the blue room in Cambridge for seven years yeah and that was an open kitchen as well so you're on your best game when people are watching you know so I learned that from there and it just rolls over here and now like you said yeah you can see people eating your dish you can see\nNormally you don't get to see their reactions and somebody puts their like biting your mouth and they like it or they don't like it either way um but you can see it and it's it's really cool it's a cool thing to be kind of out there seeing kind of being involved with the diners eat and you know they come up and talk to you and you know asking questions so the good\nThe good thing to have I I Love open kitchens\nAnd it's funny because as open kids become more popular I did a year in a restaurant so I was the worst waiter ever [laughter] but uh the the kitchen language has to be toned down obviously yeah you're on the front of the house yeah that's another good thing is the uh the language is more PG once he got a family yeah ... yeah exactly keeps them in check a little bit more\nBefore we go on to the competition your burgers yeah 'cause I saw your cooking them and I and I was looking at him like that looks like cheese almost\nMelting out of the burger yeah so what about because I Know you guys you buy some burgers which I've become a huge fan of by some burgers I Love that you guys doing here but you do a little bit different spices burger\nYes we do your traditional by some burgers planes or you know nice and healthy clean 'em but then we also were messing around while I was messing around the kitchen one day for the owner's son was made me something good as you know I'm sure so I took some pulled pork and I stuffed in the by some burger with some cheddar cheese\nAnd then we grilled that and we called our beast obese yeah so it's the or by some burgers suffer pulled pork cheddar cheese and then we saw sit with our Texas in Carolina oh we got a call our county sauce ego and then we put onion rings on top and cheddar cheese and a dusting with like our house Cajun chili does so it's\nBasically like a like a burger plus of pulled pork sandwich all mixed into one delicious by yeah it's a whole lot of happy [laughter] you know at least up or you do that is the only one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wicked Bites Radio", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
