{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Yeah so are you know being on my way of different we are many different theories different opportunities new strategies share with people\nAnd one of the ways that we help people safeguard what they have created an income stream is we use what we call the domino theory and it's really used by some of the greatest universities and some of the greatest colleges here in in the country\nBut that's just one of the many things that we can help people do to protect what they have and you were you were speaking earlier about stress for retirement\nI read the book maybe four years ago and it took me maybe two or three nights before going to bed 'cause there was so interesting I couldn't put it down and in fact if people call\nNow I'm going to take one step further I I don't know about you Michael my attention span sometimes I\nWish we didn't give me a free book I might not read it\nBut if if you get this book has one image I Want to bookmark chapter seven seven chapter seven I'm In fact I'm On a book market with her Chris one dollar bills or you won't you won't forget it you'll be short opening chapter seven talks about how to lock in your games it's very valuable\nWhen you talk about locking in your gains and means taking a little bit of what the market has given us and then you know again going back to your to rules never taking a loss and that's got to be important because a lot of folks\nI Would imagine are in the position of thinking like you were talking about that client just a a little bit ago he was sixty two and and he is a chance I get you can't go back to work uh so what he has has to last him for the rest of his life and write to retirement I mean that's a that's a scary proposition there\nYou might get you got one shot at retirement that's at one time maybe do it a second chance second time chances are something terribly wrong yeah you don't want you you want to make sure that especially like this gentleman is sixty two you want to make sure you do it right you want to know your options listen it's it's you work too hard for that money you know\nEight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven four your complimentary copy of the book stress free retirement next five radio colors that is a for you eight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven to get\nFive to ten years out from retirement incredibly critical time and you guys really tackled this head on with your workshops that are coming up a little bit later on this month and usually\nYou know you guys start promoting these workshops and you guys start to hear feedback this particular time you guys been hearing feedback about Saturday's give us some Saturday days give us some Saturday dates and you guys have come through again and you know ...\nHours yeah no Saturday October twenty seventh later on this month Saturday October twenty seventh will be at the ...\n... am in the morning no traffic and then Tuesday October thirtieth\nWill be in ... and ... noontime start and for um your reservation you can go to again just don't lose the money dot com you can register right on line just don't lose the money dot com John at those workshops we'll talk\nNot only about sort of our standard process of three sixty five retirement plan will talk a little bit about how important it is to understand the sequence of returns was that missile returns well you know when you have time\nYou can weather the storm and people say John all the time I leave it alone will come back\nYeah I mean that for the person who has enough money to let it come back and a half the time what happens is will sequence of returns Mike is\nIt's a matter of when you want to start making withdrawals from your portfolio what's happening with the full full at that time of the withdrawal dries you if you're lucky\nAnd you have a couple of good use of gains you'll be okay but if you unlucky yeah like if you're in the first year your retirement and it was two thousand and eight and it was you were lucky the market went down will say forty percent you turn around and you took a four percent because that's what you needed to offset Social Security and your arm to use an income [laughter]\nFloat your portfolio last forty four percent that shocked the money's gone so the flip side if you have a couple of positive views and you're making ten percent for an example and you're only taken over four percent well your principles growing at six percent [noise] so the sequence of returns is as critical when it comes time to retire\nAnd I said it earlier here we are we're on the tenure Bull Run we all keep thinking the market\nHas lost his legs or what have you and it continues to struggle on but the question is where is it going to be when it's time for you to start taking the withdrawals to live your life to all the\nAnd that's why it's so important we talked earlier about today about the perfect storm of opportunity it'd be near and retire\nI mean listen you've got to Josh protect what you have because you probably have the most money ever a number to create an income plan ... three sixty five retirement plan normally shows you how you can pay your bills 'cause the first thing that we do the bedrock is create an income plan but then John you do a great job and helping people choose the right type of investments we\nPut a ... together but I Will say don't don't go about it a long look for an advisor look for someone that you trust someone who knows what they're doing ask questions sit down with someone whether it be also another person don't try to go about it a little because it's too important to try to do it yourself\nAs right and you know we we said over and over we we took a team approach from us almost Thirty years now we've had said to people you can come to one place under one roof and just really get everything that matters and retirement do taxes take a look at that\nYour state plan made sure that you will was interests or an order\nOn John you're helping them with their investments to try to get you know the best return possible and then most importantly\nThe bedrock of any good retirement plan knowing\nWhere you're going to get income for the next twenty twenty five thirty years of your life\nAnd that is a long time and here's the beauty of all this the way I see it is that folks can go and kind of ... their toe into the water\nOr at these workshops again October twenty seventh and October thirtieth or go to just don't lose the money

yeah\nBetween the radio show for three hours on Sundays and then half an hour on Saturdays with the TV show we really cover all you need to know about where you're going to eat\nThat's right that's right and you know I Want to update folks that I I promised everybody I Would keep on top of this and because I'm getting angry at this at this point for these are businesses for a that another business residents in in the north shore sticking\nAnd my ... and over north end or and and Laurence Tribe that have gone through this\nA problem with gas the gas explosion that happened a month ago Saturday\nSo one month there actually opening up like a three areas ... a basically\nA camp or is that they're bringing in the house people are drinking cold there and there's one in North Andover at the ... and grow in a baseball field you know and that is going to be nothing but campers\nAnd I don't think there's anybody in there now there's one in Lawrence I think there's like a hundred and something campers and there's about Thirteen people that are already there but as the weather gets cold people are not going to want to stay home and from what I'm hearing from businesses and folks\nI don't know of Columbia gases is up to this or they're they're causing a lot of suffering from from people and they're not\n[noise] I I Know one person the story was related to me that she's been in a hotel from one month now\nHer insurance is paying for her hotel mhm that insurance I guess runs out after a month so it has run out okay she has received two checks from Columbia gas right now for two hundred dollars like a piece that okay\nHow do you expect to maintain life you're not [laughter]\nWhat I Do not expect that at the at that rate\nI mean that that's just not right and and I've talked to several businesses now and they're not mad at the Columbia gas workers I mean they're doing everything they can to get the get it back\nI drive around Lawrence Andover you see I mean they're out working there they are working there were it was a it was a massive massive tragedy that nobody expected to happen so I mean it's going to take a minute or two and I understand if you're in that situation you think a minute is a year and yeah and it it feels that way and I sympathize with that but yeah it's it's\nKind of thinking about half way now all the repair and they're and they're working\nDay and night I like I said a last hour I was dry aside side wrote and get through a Lawrence and every street I went down there they were tearing up the street and there was a whole bunch of workers and ... they're trying to get it done when it's also this is something that has to\nI guess to to be the voice of reason if you will or the the calming voice it's something that has to be done in stages you know because they don't want to rush it or do to try to go too quick and then\nIt causes a bigger problem you know everything has to be done in a certain way right but I'm looking at it as the and say you want to be a gas who caused the problem over ... you can blame off of them it\nWas a mistake and that that's what happened but you take ownership and and get some money I mean they donate like ten million dollars to to this relief effort OK okay fine but you know\nThat's that's that's petty cash to people that need money right now I spoke to a one restaurant tour mhm he said he help fill out the claims for his workers they could not you know that last paychecks instills right\nHe says as of uh this is I talked to him last week he says none of 'em are we seeing one person has received a little bit of money that's it yeah and that's that's I mean it's a month into it right now distribute the money yeah\nYou know what are they what are you ... what are you worried about a little bit of fraud or something like that I mean these people living day to day and the same restaurant toward also told me that two of his longtime wait staff yeah had to get another job they they left that\nThat was expected almost instantaneously because I mean most people especially at the at the wait staff level they're living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd all and they're not it's not some you playing for it's not like oh we got a vacation coming up or oh it's a New England winter so there might be a snow day here and there we have to shut down or you know like the big blizzard cause you know everybody to shut down but everyone was shut down and it was again it was wintertime in New England this is something that you can't plan for there's no contingency for this so\nAlmost instantaneously you're you're out of a job and out of pocket and it's like what am I gonna rent bills I got an adult responsibilities I go to go find a way to make some money yeah I I mean I I look at the\nBusinesses ... and of course the residents that are just a you know you drive by a ... a lot of areas and not affected and you have no idea right but you have no idea what it's like you know to sit here and say okay a lot of people in in this area or the kids are going to school\nRight so early in life it has to go on living campers for for for a period of time I got to get out and make some of these these these people whole\nI mean I I feel bad for these restaurant tours that I'm Talking to a restaurant or is I mean I I'm just gonna look at it at that sliver of of businesses that are herbicide were on that and and they're the most affected by the gas because you you know they cope with it they cook and they do they've had a long time employees\nAnd now all of a sudden those employees several of them probably have\nAn ... and I know one restaurant I talked to one restaurant I didn't even think about this ... they had to leave to get other jobs yeah so now that they are about to open up or they've opened up\nI got a they got\n... in a tough job economy for the restaurant towards their staff the restaurant yeah so it it it's a long term effect is going to be felt by these restaurants in a long time and let me give you an update of what I Know shot in the north end over they opened up okay that I went there for lunch just the other day\nAnd uh as places open up I go there and are posting pictures and I want folks to go there and\nYet everybody should ... as you find out about these places opening up police patronize them that they will ah they were really appreciate it more than you know\nYeah see I shot it when you go in leads to a that's a Lebanese food you know and I had a a former\nA sandwich the other day that was that was excellent and my wife had like a seafood casserole special that was really really good you know uh so I Would I Would say go in and say Hi to shot a they'll look at a route one twenty five in North Andover\nI Would say cross the street roughly from ... gas as a landmark for ... to find them or they've done a beautiful job inside too I haven't been in there in years\nAgo yeah I Love the bar area the larger is just gorgeous did a great job [noise] uh I got an email from the folks over trauma grilling north Andover yes he is expected to be open on Wednesday\nThat was also a that was posted our ... group on Facebook or by Bob he said that he was talking to them as well and same thing they're they're hoping to be open\nNext week but I I I Will go back to wield so I'm On vacation I had was in the weeks ago yeah and he was hoping to be open that week that way and that hasn't happened so hopefully this is a week I I think it may be just by looking at\nAll the work that they're putting into that section of town and then rose at the digging up and the surrounding restaurants that are starting to open up as well right they gotta ... cheese and a ... and right next door to that so I expect that they'll open up at the same time\nAnd all of them have like sign saying closed because of the gas rounds so hopefully they open up some uh\nBoston chowder company has remained open they close for a couple of days they're right in that same area sure uh but they can't do like French fries looking at requires gas but they can do the showers they could do the sandwiches and stuff like that so they're they're fighting through ... you know because that's what you have to do in Andover Mm Palmer's\nSo close no date\nElm square oyster company closed\nMhm no day ah we have a sweet a tide sweep pays will just reopened in hand over so they have reopened so hopefully it will get up a little bit further south to get the farmers opened up I drove by a Palmer's earlier in the week and\nYou know he basically had

on Facebook a sauce wings that they opened up a I think most of the places that are opening are still on like a for lack of better term limited menu they're they're making what they can yes you know without even if they don't have gas and they're trying to open up their making what they can write but ah but they're I Believe open or they have ...\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga like wrote a lot of the

[laughter] and they don't knock try mend it might fix you know that it'll sweat it out of you know ... ... C Marvin much like myself who you sweat it out gone yeah\nYeah well that's one of those you don't care if you're sick or not and I got one more hour before I take a nap with the apple Chris [laughter] I've already thank you very much for your\nPhone call up an Asian restaurant in have are all you know I was there just the other night the finishing restaurant\nFor those folks that that that do the history of the nation restaurant how it really got started way back when when I was a kid I have to go back when I was a kid we really wanted that long ago but there was a restaurant in Lawrence\nThat is now Wendy's [laughter] but it started or to the store it started off as a restaurant in Lawrence that everybody went to an island folks would drive an hour and a half to go out to dinner new Lawrence at bishops ... you know they were just famous\nAnd the ... or ... they decided like you know we we ah everybody's done we're done we just want to retire okay so there wait staff\nSaid do you mind if we you know kind of take your menu and kind of go on ... open up our own place and they said no it would be honored mhm if you do that whether they opened up a place called the Phoenician restaurant and have all\nThe same menu their prime rib I mean there's no way you could finish the king cut it's about three pounds and strange easy easy easy and the French fries I mean that's what's\nTheir French fries their hand cut and I and I'm Talking about French fries right you get them\nTo get one for the tables sure they're hard to stop eating [laughter] so then when you are prime rib comes around or reading with ... you can't you can't finish\nThat's part of the reason you can't I mean not not the fact that the prime rib is three plus pounder but the fact that you've studied French fries for meal\nAnd I would also recommend that three pound bake stuff lobster everything's three pounds with if they don't believe in a medium or small size walnut stuffing on that big stuff lobster\nAnd it also depends on the same room for dessert makes Alaska they use Richardson's ice cream and say Hi you're that's the Phoenician restaurant one ten twelve hours history and I will take a break we back with more right after the\nFighting the weekend\nListening to a wicked vice radio the only way to let you be the blueprint Sunday on ... the voice of Boston\nVoice in Boston\nYou walking over one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I aren't radio station [noise]\nMichelle France and growing tension over the alleged murder of Washington Post columnist Jim ... Saudi Arabia rejecting what it calls are threats by the U.S that after President Trump said there would be quote severe punishment if there's proof the country is responsible\nCNN's okay I don't know I got it and I know them yeah I Know John writes pubs yeah that I Know a generation of started there\nI was at the one in ... and I told you a couple of weeks ago and\nI I kind of tell you now you're\nYounger than me yeah I go back uh you don't have to agree with me that much [laughter] ah I go back\nTo the old these days in soon and\nWhen I was at John Ryan ... on the other day I had your chicken parmesan\nIt reminded me\nThat this this the sauce of the old ... place yeah I mean almost\nIdentical to where I bought my taste buds right back twenty something twenty five thirty years ago ... a ... I don't know if that's in by by accident but I as soon as I had I had to go back and it gets more\nThan chicken parmesan very popular dish 'em we make we make the manor house um so it it's good it's good stuff that understand the best food we can\nAnd the views of the location of filling out back\nYeah that is awesome awesome back I'm In the summertime it's hard to even get out there on a nice and that is probably an hour wait to get on the deck\nYou're gonna keep the deck open for a while uh yeah we have eaters\nUm so we try to keep it open as long as we can as long as people go out there and will even open\nOh it it just an outstanding view and John Ryan's problem I think is\nKind of I don't really I like it because it's comfort food\nYeah and you can go there like multiple times a week [laughter] yeah ... ... you know it's not like a fancy restaurant you may go to like once a year there's a place you to go out to eat you know and they had to go back and back and back\nYeah we try to make sure we have like a big menu so we can make everybody happy when you go out to eat and if you come back and a few days or something else that you can try and it's not always like just strictly Italian and we stay said everything fresh fish and now he's trying to make a pretty diverse\nYeah I Would highly recommend a ... a little bit brusque outside but ... just sitting out a good ... actually the one that was still in the windows all over the river\nYeah if you go into the bar area there's huge windows and you can sit right along the windows and look on the water which is nice\nFor a life jacket on [laughter] you know we don't have many days like this left no they go out there but the ... the original location is the one in ... you have no right behind that location I mean literally\nRight behind it yep right behind it there's a strip mall and I'm not sure the name of the strip mall and that's where your opening I and I am so looking forward to this because it is\nYou know I I'm like a barbeque I'm unreal barbecue not you know I'm kind of a fanatic you're opening up a brand new restaurant that that is going to open up in a couple of we called Bobby injects now Bobby is your Bobby\nAs my oldest son and Jack is my youngest son\nAll right so this is all staying in the family or you know and where did you come up I hear your ... you have the pups\nWhy go from which is a very successful formula 'cause you're you're doing things right you know a wide open up a a different place style cooking\nUm well ... I've been like testing barbecue for a long time now and um barbecue's one of the fastest growing like food concepts out right now so you know we tried and there's not a lot of barbecue places around us so we were just trying to hit the market well it's it's good and I'm just try something different\nAnd it's really one of those were just trying to ... ... you're you're you're\nPutting both toes and quick I mean you're jumping right on into the into the fire I mean this is a place at the size ...\nOr eighty five hundred square feet um it's a it's a big restaurant\nI I Love 'cause I got a sneak preview I was I walked in the other day the bar itself\nYeah the the bars very big it's a fifty five feet long\nFifty five foot long bar Mike uh-huh did you see that they should like slide the beer is now from one side [laughter]\nSeats that hold\n'em did I Want to say it's thirty four seats at the bar is pretty good um and then there's a bunch of lounge tables and six Seventy five TVs behind the Seventy five inch TVs behind the bar Seventy\nFive inch TV yeah wow I saw the brackets going on [laughter] isn't that a buddy it's going to be something that I think when it opens up is going to take the area by storm and I even if you're not like a a somebody that barbecued ... like myself sure the atmosphere a low\nYeah it's it's like you're going to go away it's unique for sure you're going to walk in and and we want it to be a while we have a Nineteen fifties John Deere tractor in the waiting area\nUm their looks brand new an adult fully resourced or um you know the host galley or the galley for the servers is a barn and you know there's a lot of visuals to the place so when you go in there you definitely we want it to be a while\nAnd I think you're going to get that when you walk in and and I all I Love some of the the atmosphere at some of the size and the lighting that you're putting putting up when I was there at the same time so it's it's a lot of creativity that's going in and it's gonna be a place that you want to go out and hang out I have a feeling that that bar area is just going to take right off\nYeah 'cause there's nothing like no not not around here anyway I I I\nI Can't think of the larger bar yeah tape talk right now what\nI was actually I was commenting earlier in the show um because I was talking to some people up in the in that area you know the the southern ... to ... up that route three area\nAnd they were like ... you know 'cause they're asking about barbecue we just want a barbecue show on TV and like all the places recommended like yeah but I don't want to drive that far well now they're going to have an option up there and to experience with Bobby injects\nYeah yeah and now before I mean again the atmosphere is gonna be like no other I I really think it's going to be kind of hip it's going to be kinda fun even the signs that you put it that that I've seen ... ... it's gonna it's gonna give you that southern hip feel like I I I guess yeah\nYeah it's definitely like a modern uh it definitely upbeat the mode of going to be upbeat hip place\nFor a lot of money into oh yeah there are other this wasn't like a a fly by night\nNo no this was going to quit flipped three definitely we took our time as we put a lot of money into the place\nBasically the lights that we're going to hang over to the table tops whatever was sitting in there they're pretty much sitting on the tables at that moment [laughter] so ready to be installed so if you're getting ...\nOh it's almost done I'd say we're probably about Ninety eight percent on last night they put the final glaze on the top so we're almost there\nWow yeah and then you you and you see the bar you walk in the barrio and the thing that's going to hit you too is the smoker yeah out in full view mhm provokes a vertical\nYeah there's like a whole little like kind of vestibule that separates it often when he's sitting in the bar area of the smokers right there it's a southern pride SPA fourteen hundred it's a it's a big smoker it holds fourteen hundred pounds of meat at once [noise] so it's a it's the biggest one they make ...\nWow I mean these are very fourteen hundred pounds of meat in that smoker one time\nIt's funny 'cause we're we're we're streaming though on our Facebook page as well Facebook dot com slash wicked bites TV and I'm Mike was commenting that he he's actually watching us from elliptical\nAnd he's looking out the window you actually just sent me a pitcher he's looking out the window in John run about [laughter] so he's right across the street from the Bob so he does that were given a motivation basically an all he has to do is just ... just a little bit beyond that give you so I have another half an hour or so and then you go across the street the pub\n[laughter] yeah that that's that's funny that's funny [noise]\nBut I I it's got to be opening up in a couple of weeks and what's your menu gonna feature I Know it's gonna be barbecue yeah have you on the menu is the menu already together yeah the\n... menu is pretty much together it's it's it's pretty locked down I'm going to be like traditional barbecue can have St Louis ribs we're going to have a baby back ribs pulled pork pulled chicken a burnt and you know the stand the standard southern barbecue with ... and Mac and cheese and potato salad\nA homemade French fries and you know pretty pretty standard barbecue\nBut but no one John Ryan pubs like I Do\nStandard isn't what you're going to be doing you're going to do things up at I have a feeling even like your sauces you'd probably not just in his jar saw\nSnow and all our sauce is going to be a homemade and we want this to being right and traditional southern barbecue\nAnd that's what you all about doing things right and that's why I think the pilots have taken all\nI mean how did you arrive pups but around that not that law I'm we're on our we're going to be eight years wow so time flies yeah time does fly it really does and he seems like you keep adding a few of those\nAre my father is very aggressive so I've noticed that [laughter] so ah he's definitely over the last seven years we've been full bore\nYeah a ... it's a ... a spot that you go in and get great comfort food and now I have a feeling that's exactly it we're going to do when when Bobby and Jack's Memphis barbecue opens up and and what is the name that strip mall again\n[laughter] um I honestly I don't I don't I'm not even the revenue in Seventy seven main street\nYeah yeah I'm not sure there is even the name of that plaza I don't know uh but it's it's it's going to be the most anticipated opening of a restaurant\nIn a while in the north shore you know a north of Boston I guarantee that\nJohn ... do you have an open date are you still kind of\nUm it's probably a last week in October first week in November we don't have a set day just because we haven't got all our permits and stuff like that judge all up to
