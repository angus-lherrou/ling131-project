[noise] do you think they need ... votes in one hundred and forty seven till UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIs sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and his band and in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law but as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him is Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee parents and the whole process just isn't that sort of\nProcess it reflects terribly well on the court and enter the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court through the meeting or pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's ... do you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nSo I guess if the things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll [laughter] kind of break it down and and take a micro parts\nThat and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw little bit there have been other times and on on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for\nThe court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it shows so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with them a bit\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts\nIt's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name and now with all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have some of the doubt for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know in justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public\nOff the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings but just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice to us I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he finds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with a with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly\nThat that

some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do at the heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat the\nCat into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and\nSo I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who are sensitive and loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of an accident and horrific situations that they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed\nAnd so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize\nThat you're not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it and I've done some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror neurons are the compassion their own in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such a big interest standing impact and thought\nThat the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a T scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle you weren't mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\n[noise] so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you\nSee something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all like ... patients lose fat and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on friday and negative news\nIt's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many facets go out in nature met an exercise Brandon lab so that's one tool\nBut also just noted past traumas\nTriggered for instance you know if you lost your father and\nYou know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're taking on like what you hear in the news\nFrom that or go outside um learn now the complete sentence with paper because then I don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires are draining\nAnd you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear things and the news they don't want to be around energy vampires so I write about it or just enjoying your energy\nFor were speak with Dr Judah oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed [noise] um can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy caused themselves long term harm [noise]\nOh definitely and and have don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book be kind of course they never want to go outside they had panic disorders making\nIt a lot of the nation is because there are sensory overload overtime or they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it\nAnd so now I Believe the empathy is a trait that it's going to the world really good I feel so strongly about it it's something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and it has to be having to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing it so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on suffering of the world", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "09"}
