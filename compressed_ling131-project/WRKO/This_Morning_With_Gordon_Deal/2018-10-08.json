talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the

participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nAh and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is [laughter] I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it and a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working on so [noise] um for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or\nMove the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\n[laughter] I think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters
