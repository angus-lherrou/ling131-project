I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lost civilizations starting something in ... and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro was your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and\nYou know what that is bad walk that's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nSo it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that\nThings that maybe there were shrines on in the three locations and there were a line to you know the bell stars of Orion dating to the happy and then you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built up your image on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you're walking to the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating
