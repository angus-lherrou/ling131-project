Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nWith our tuition and direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care and some doubt initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah and there's some of the state that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and its time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut if you're trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid people the way of Obamacare intend to\nDo these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some some pushback\nFrom officials and some of the state and one of the interesting thing that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative include the way to\nPay for the state's share of expansion of federal government paid her most of the costs of the state does have some portion of the ... name which was at first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nTo governor there has three she has to go along in part because the funding issue in Utah now they're trying to avoid that additional robot [laughter] by including a binding initiative along with their um finishing their ballot initiative trial\nSo how similar are the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n... the main thing is that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to people out there are enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference here is the ah the hunting element in Utah that goes along with that I'm an issue one week and it's still um ... and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from the hospital particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money the\nWell that would help us and we're not tapping into it even though ... dodge march states are going to find these things and you know across the country\nOne argument for why that had happened by mail initiative is there any they're conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting for CARE Act but if their voters say we want that than there is a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grabbing Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially they're Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on how to care issues for a number of years on on a hill and he said a foreign with healthcare reporters that he thinks that phase initiatives have found that should as in these states passed that it it could it's a trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs that haven't expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that advocate for the Affordable care\nAct don't fly such as imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that that are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky [noise] okay\nYeah I went to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have to say in it there's in state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money would there be a guarantee that there would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making\nIs that you can't guarantee can't guaranteed that they said that funding will be there forever on Saturday in their their argument is that it states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live on that targeting of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion states are going to be on their own\n...
