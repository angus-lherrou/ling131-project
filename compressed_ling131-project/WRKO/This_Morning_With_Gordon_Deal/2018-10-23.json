civil war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's school reform matory yep we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a follower Renault but anyway uh\nMy father died and\nThree months later my mom she's really depressed\nDidn't know how things were going to work out the you know to put two kids and just before daylight woke up my father was there he came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom stood up\nYou have your history and said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional is will they Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part if in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um you know these are positive experiences in their life changing\nAnd they reaffirm the connective ness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life it's going to join the Bronx side job some going hey George how are you know Joe\nGood a brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a full up are rich and then I seen um [noise]\nThe um the question you think that there is some luminal undo channel of communication going on\nBetween the go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the uh goes we have permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast [laughter] um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before you had the experience maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nAll right um\nOh it's your second question then we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench me five pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you need it the motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something\nIt's not just information at the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there's some sort of like\nI'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere did we get the book to go study sprinted\nA study that available at Barnes and noble than Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or I'm In the car you can get it at audible as well so basically

story in about twenty minutes\nBefore the Gulf thinking right now is that the blue wave for the mid term elections is not going to be as powerful as once believed that dead history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections\nWith a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side jury set this up\nWell show for Democrats to win a control the Senate and the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough stage win those states keep a seat and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm\nA lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there and find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what ... what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on a state that has been increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kavanaugh one or two oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the ballots should be deeply important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have to build they'll send a Denmark another democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights\nVery leery or a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is Michael and does that help Governor Scott has he seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him as people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold on to that when if they're going to have a chance answered is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a jet flights\nRepublican retiring repairs on his kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way in any election [laughter]\nUh and you have to you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the Democratic side of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if\nDemocrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total one of those probably gonna have ears on him so that seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida ... it's kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\nThat that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm either going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it a a suburban voters or is it\nHispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities [laughter] those are two groups of voters to simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance in a presidential election so\nUh you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but you know enthusiasm three weeks before the election actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhen Jerry it's Wall Street journal executive
