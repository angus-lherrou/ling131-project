I don't know a few years back\nYeah I think it was just before the ... to ... sixty before the election in twenty seven team we had a series that rice and being bailed the people\nAnd rice and seem to be the male of choice for more than a couple of years 'cause if you remember right after nine eleven I think there was something that would be bailed out too\nAnd then here probably five six years ago there was a bunch of it that it never really call down\nSo what do you do I mean how do you protect yourself if you think you might be targeted in some way shape or form with something suspicious in the mail\nWell the first thing you need to do is look at the package or ... or whatever it is you're going to get in the mail or by delivery service\nAnd she who is sending it to you if you're not expecting a package from that individual then you probably should call them ... ... email whatever the case may be and say hey you sent me an academic or something\nAnd if they say no and there is a different side is something wrong with the packages that had been mailed to CNN and all the political\nFigures you know the name the return address was wrong or name which uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz I Believe it was yeah whoever sent them spelled her name Ron right right and I don't think she's going to spell her own a wrong she sitting back and just people\nWho speak with Robert Sellers workplace safety expertise also author of a training manual on the prevention of workplace violence it's called the one too many and we're discussing the suspicious packages that have been mailed out I'm used to it you just pay attention to the delivery person if it's not the same person you might want to raise a flag of caution\nRight now and obviously you know the package delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in\nBut it it has been my experience in the past that the delivery people coming in to office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day\nUnless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know it may you know where's second such\nYou know if they said on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air science but it I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah then there could be an issue with that because they are trying to get out of the building as fast as they possibly can\nAre these days um most of us are in this see something say something mode hopefully right but uh if there's something that I don't know it just strikes you as odd what do you do I mean you could call nine one one right away do you alert building security line and what's what's the protocol\nWell it I Would more than likely call your Security Department first or whoever happens to be in charge of security I mean if you're in an office that our job was building it may not have a dedicated security team there\nSo call your age are person first and let them make the decision to call if\nYou're working and if you're factoring plant then you you know you don't want to call the security there and or they're likely they're going to get a call nine one one and most of the guy that police are not going to be too concerned if it's just a false alarm for a suspicious package\nBecause they

broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channel as well so it's even worse than it sounds but we are the number one marketed in the country that turned out for each political ads and\nYou know as I noted in the story if you think that it may be better in Tucson for example there are actually number three over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with

overwhelmingly negative in all the way to the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start and uh you know people here have ... across the board\nFor us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so this is something that yeah we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know car carpet bomb us
