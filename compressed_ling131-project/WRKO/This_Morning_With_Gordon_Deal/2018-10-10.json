advertisements\nRepresenting an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president is an avid watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly in fact can friend in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening ... little ... them over at the Fox business channel until the general public notice and still have lobbyists and\nLobbyist have found that in effect give way to get a message in front of the president is to\nAdvertise during his favorite TV program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like a fern what example whose airing what\nWell we took a look at the story now because

News programs and groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same program\nIs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see that he can gauge sometimes directly after an ad\nThat pops up on TALK on this happened to win a group of a steel workers with advertising during boxing fan in March you know as the ad came up president started talking about the issue to suggesting that he had seen the ad [laughter] um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last\nYear billionaire Tom dire who constantly in fights with the president and started an impeachment movement I'm kind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do that ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only the president watching but the the program some towns have really strong viewership um during the administrators and the viewership has written and still have the ad rates and we've actually seen some ... from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the ... are also watching and so

being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategist also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president and express dislike for programs on on those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about\nHim and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may be some types of advertising and and death flag it to him\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach how he feels like he just suspects at the president's watching and knows he can talk and it was like a little elbow and the ribs kind of add\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting here is the president has been very disparaging of Saturday Night\nLive as a show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some evidence that he was watching and groups are also starting to put
