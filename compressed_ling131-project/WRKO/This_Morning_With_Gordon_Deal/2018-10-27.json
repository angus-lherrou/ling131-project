the mega millions jak part of the Powerball but he's still wondering what if I did and there's nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves\nVisionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what are you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real\nAnd starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way we know that the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch relief far\nSo that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at our lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way\nAnd so people me things that give them hope and when we dream and we wonder and we think if I go by that ticket why would I Do that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance integrate or way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however\nI see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about getting out not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't yours and you have to go back to work that day\nWhat you want to do is say OK why can't I have\nX Y Z and instill that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with and so it's about being able to put into that\nStretches and it sets and pension really different\nIs there's such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to or I don't know I\nSure I mean if we dream that did that then we don't follow it up with any yeah then I mean that creates us to go into things like anxiety or even to be depressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we felt again we self doubt we self sabotage\n... speaking with Laurie Dixon visionary coach based in Dallas texas returning about how you can turn your big lotto dreams into improving your life or a somewhat of a reality I'm so explain

... uh what do you say is the fastest way to destroy your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotage by others but self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we
