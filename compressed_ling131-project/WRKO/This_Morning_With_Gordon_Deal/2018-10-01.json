like the people in the Bronx and paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans\nIt was like they were too perfect not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle\nThe cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that their records their their sounds\nIt was in those sim woods where I heard this a ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection these humanoid that I saw in the woods or more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans\nAnd hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nAnd well we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's

where it's quiet and there's nobody around her out\nSit there and went down to looking at stars to the ... and I heard that same sound that he's talking about is just as I Know what he's talking about um ... at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but it was kind of like a what do you do end up here and in\nA second guessing but oil and really far away and you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept a now look at the stars and about and it and they closed oh I'd say at least three miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche congressionally all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd may I jump to my car so bad and got out of there\nAnd you know I never really piece together what was you know I'm

doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a ...\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm

and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting

starting today sports to tie breakers needed today to decide a couple of baseball division winners and wild card teams and how Dunkin' Donuts fans are responding to the company name change that story and about twenty minutes\nTen years ago this failure of Lehman Brothers exposed how cavalier the world\nHad been towards risk households have bought homes they thought could never go down in price and banks had made loans they thought would never defaults and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nWe've got to ... basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who thought that the loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know boom about sort of crises [laughter]\nBut it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there's several rates for that one is that well um [noise] we're dating country so maybe fewer people eat home [laughter]\nBut also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who could buy a house and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious than investing and so we see investment if you look at housing ambulances methods combined it tends to be a little bit more muted [laughter]\nYou don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age in a sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise] sure you have your ... months there but it really kind of the ...\nShouldn't you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook\nThe level of new businesses being formed actually historically quite low I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry that is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested in there for some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ...\nAnd fell into that so in some sense that some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that some of the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to get a bus in a recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off [laughter] I don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which\n... start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk of a kind of like goes away to sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier tried to find a way around it and\nAnd we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like ... companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks a private equity funds so you some sense skill at risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether the system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter
