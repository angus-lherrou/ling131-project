before Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee it looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the mid term elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle over judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors so Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races that were pretty close and Cavanaugh is\nA factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand\nWhat really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which had been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republicans in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on Tuesday as ...\nA big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining\nUndecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nWho are now in the upper single digits or in terms of his lead and the polling average is a you know that was a race that's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely to vote

vote against capital she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch\nHuh Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state and it's been really hitting her\nOn this issue on the issue of conservative judges so she has\nA much narrower leader in the polls there are some polls still there was a recent CNN poll that did have a history but in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead and this could be a race that's influenced by by the Supreme Court matter\nWe're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states ... probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance in the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor a but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections where Democrats are already pretty energized\nBecause they dislike President Trump they dislike Republicans are doing a Washington\nThere seems to them like another power grab by narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote for Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump for the first place was they wanted conservative judges cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court\nThey didn't want to see that particular to go to a liberal that Anthony Kennedy she go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid

there's nothing small about your business they provide one on one partnership and reliable dill PCs with intel core processors to get business done President Trump's new trade deal with Canada and Mexico isn't nothing it offers new protections for us intellectual property along with data and digital assets\nIt slightly improved American access to the Canadian dairy market and new provisions on autos could protect some us manufacturing jobs\nBut his trade experts scour the details of the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement they wonder why so much effort produced so little change so says Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman Rick how do you see it\nWell I mean so let's talk about what different um uh the uh there's a slight increase in the percent of\nThe a Canadian dairy market that us farmers will have access to a they're going to be some new rules on 'em using I'm a high cost labor in the production of cars if they want it passed\nBetween the tree country duty free without attach so that might protect some of\nThe American jobs but it's also going to raise the cost of cars\nAnd the one thing where I think Trump does deserve credit for improving upon the original NAFTA isn't there now a new provisions that protect intellectual property and data and digital assets\nWhich really were not part of the original NAFTA which went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four which was before the Internet as we think of it today even existed so it ... the agreement has been updated just to take\nAccount of changes in technology so that's a good thing but guess what\nAll of those changes would have been in Trans Pacific partnership deal which also would have included Canada and Mexico which Trump pulled the United states that\nYou're just a Trump paid her and like the pedal fake news isn't it [laughter]\nNo it's not true ah I read something called the ... report card you're a finance or we're give Trump were accepting that Trump's performance on the economy on a monthly basis we're currently give him a B\nFor handling of the economy uh that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an a or would probably be a better wage growth\nAnd better or exports which are to the six factors we look at it but we get we are saying what tropic presiding over a stronger economy\nUh I I don't get into whether Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say look the economy kind of thing\nBut president either get credit or blame for it so\nI'll be doing okay on the economy um but some of the things she doing you have to say what is it really worth all the controversy and disturbing drawn of oh we're going to tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're going to make some minor changes in color victory\nOr speak with Yahoo Finance columnist ... knew him and his piece is called Trump's base strategy on trade re branding how much of this still might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\n[laughter] well I think what we've seen in Trump's\nOverall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year\nKind of like picking fights with everybody or he picked by to Europe or\nHe picks fights with everybody who in court room and image United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through the development it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd and he's actually listening to trade experts say look I'm we really don't have much trade problem with Canada we really\nDon't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else they basically ally so why are you picking fights with our eyes um when you need their help to put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement or a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... we should first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries and that is not a given um if it turns out the Democrats take back control of the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be a very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible\nWe can be stuck with the old NAFTA for the indefinite future\nIt's Rick Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman\nReminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter with the username at this morning
