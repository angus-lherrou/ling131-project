Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and ah you know\nOne thing that Senator Cruz said not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the party establishment kind of coming in and and helping them out you know the vice president making money or the president's on campaigning for and the president offering to come down and campaign for him\nAh so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the quintessential out better candidate got to get help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rate them and make it a you know give them an edge on that in fact the\nAnd how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting with what I think even Cruz supporters of course the ... they would argue that you know the conservatives are banned but he always was a huge though you know you have an abandoned value but what about that I talked to attack the comments actually you know ... the change in his values are are becoming more of a moderate you the collapse\nSupport uh and that's not really what's happening is that he's just relying on helping the more collaborative bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I talked to last quarter of it\nWhat are the are as you said the pieces campaign ... earlier this year uh why is that what ... what Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I think the thing about that or get out of money and out of the ... um you know he only crazy amount of money with all of these rallies that you know thousands of people were going to and and he got it\nPark sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd he was on the currency without bending occurs on TV and not backed by a\nDemocrat could be outspending out raising at a\nRepublican impact that especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so\nIt just a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement what's real and pack and I think his campaign and how they can just kicked into\nHigh gear towards the end of summer and going into the kind of thing that they were challenging and you know they step it up and call in shows that that that was pretty clear that running away with it but he's got a healthy pretty safely\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and again they charge that over thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter while at is just an absolute record\nRestrict what James ...
