good what's on your mind\nOr is it was very is there a new wave hit a practice or maybe there's something you do before you go to sleep to help you um uh out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that so I don't know Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nYeah there I mean done in his book I'm On dreams doesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other folks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know\nSay things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice you'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian good sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is the first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan got good morning Brennan\nMorning weather on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so\nI keep having episodes where I'm I'm I'm I'm just a little tidbit I'm I suffer from insomnia so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nConsecutive days very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip or on falling asleep on my body is falling asleep in my in my mind's awake and I guess they call it sleep process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always deems that icy and usually are trying to get me and told me out of my body\nAnd not only that I can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious\nUm what your thoughts are on is this just in the ... you know might loosen eighty and like your Internet or wicked PTO will say that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that during the state of my body\nThen I'm able to actually I don't want to say ... you know something along that lines into that it is very scary actually yeah yeah yeah right yeah I think you would call you\nRented let's let's let's Christopher a response thanks Brandon for the call started to sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also\nSeemed to I I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete in there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are there are things that happen when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleeper our thing is it's scary ... is a very common you know people wake up and they can't move 'em\nYou know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so\nYou know uh get the question is is is merely a\nA physiological biological hum\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening spiritual world\nI guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness I'm you know that they'll pocket in terms of psychology and neurology\nBut um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of the spiritual realities maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions hum\nA that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a ... aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that now there are

S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders handlers to identify certain characteristics that up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious this\nThinking about this is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening in I think it's sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts in show [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing [noise] um but you\nKnow the good news is any package that to put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up and these facilities as we speak but UPS\nAnd FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here\nNow my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the post the postal service and so um you know the postal service has investigators who have deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these\nPackages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know it's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to stop it and that soil to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail room and so\nAnd the good news is the government certainly had the facilities stop these also the private and private companies are I think it will really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski [laughter] you know it's like Eighteen years to track down how where he was of course in those packages for of course spread out over a much longer period of time than the ones we're talking about here but I Do think that you know it's getting

she got\nA mixture of factors that are playing a lot of races around the country I'm the chief from being that the Republican incumbent in a district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican and they are almost became a governor a few years ago\nAnd a brand new political candidate first time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's where she will play on districts across the country where there the suburban\nWomen voters who are ... that risk losing and the thing about this district which occur outside of Seattle is is a GOP gonna lose those voters at a faster clip and um the district was recently redrawn and faster than voters can keep up with Republican [laughter]\nUm so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for Barbara updates like heart before and if they can keep them in the old and that's where the Democrats have a problem strict\nIncome above polling to indicate opening like\nA slap in trouble in on both sides that show the statistical tie so both sides car commit start going to come down to turn around and you see\nThat playing out across the country where [noise] um it's really about who can mobilize voters that most and we're seeing in polls that a national polls that Democrats are more energized than Republicans I'm an African the trend of the\nParts so ah the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's a this Kim Schrier\nController okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff\nThat's right I mean she's a bit of a direct appeal to people who um are nervous about their health care costs for seeing their costs to go up [noise] um and\nWho have pre existing conditions [laughter] um and she feels from directly as a pediatrician in their community um she's got a thousand or patients that are in that district\nUm she gives them after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition and he's with that as part of her pledge to support that provision of Obamacare\nWas a very direct appeal [noise] um that a Democrat from Washington state and in the capital believe make her buried a

thing now in canvassing summit his ears and that is the thing that they push that promise wires stump speeches and the the\n... of this district is will that be enough to keep 'em some of these Republicans in the fold or will they send a check on Donald Trump to wash\nThis is a long held Republican district\nHas drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the census I'm In Nineteen eighty and it has never been a Democrat to wash 'em but even though it has that can kill keeping records showing it to the Democrats for President Clinton Donald Trump there by about three\nAnd a mistrial or you said is getting support actually from Seattle or should have voters right\nRight it's really interesting I was trying I was out there I was trying to talk to people at an event of hers who lived in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle a common you see that in other races where people um even for cross state lines to get it to get into it because they volunteer money\nI'm sure this is just another example of that where people in Seattle [noise] you know their districts are reliably democratic\nAnd if they want to be part of the blue wave what they think will be a blue wave
