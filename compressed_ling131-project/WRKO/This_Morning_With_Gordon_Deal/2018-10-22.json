where Democrats are considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final\nStretch here have become closer than people expect that they would and we've seen that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter] so maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president some\nParts of one of them was like in ... in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive\nAnd that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise] um she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or\nHas been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman butler and Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as the\nHighest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual waste there in that um this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points\nUm so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent\nAnd this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for a democratic controlled house\nAnd are often more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there\nGot it speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near or to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes said this is an interesting way to connect with all its definitely being outweighed by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of more like classic suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and ... as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and a sort of you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise] uh and then the second that if the Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nUm this is a little bit [laughter] probably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a

criticized the fed before George Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last president to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president [noise] I'm In a short way to say what he thinks the fed should do with it and it has not happened trying to Ninety two [noise]\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been a kind of a difference in many respects the president and if another example is saying things about the fatty blaming them for the market fell off his thing that they've gotten crazy\nHobbies that they were his biggest corrupt up and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\nThat's what he said I'm a part of this has also laying the groundwork to blame the fad or if anything should go on in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there was some speculation there about why he's doing this if you look at ... the president has\nInfluence that policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people sit on the board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents are not picked by the White House boat every few weeks on monetary policy\nDonald Trump or not people who would really tick monetary policy in a radically different direction I'm sure what he's been doing this just to kind of a running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd you know the fed faces choices potentially over the next year\nAnd while the judge has put it on for criticism isn't going to change how they operate does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know if anything does\nTo go wrong the presidents of probably going to blame them for it [noise]\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president does something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent [noise]\nFor exactly right [noise] um [noise] people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed has to end but President Trump\nIs probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow [noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as a black disappears and the economy because you don't want to have inflation\nWould what President Trump is saying here is the worst inflation why would you need to raise interest rates [laughter]\nWe're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter who's ... presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be caving to the president\nSo they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\nTo write the question isn't very [noise] um difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates\nSo the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case so you're from now [noise] but see you're from now you have the unemployment rate continuing but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a coach or you don't have as much conviction about the policy path to the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously\nThe point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin the question of such credibility\nAnd that's even worse and so it might actually from their backs a little bit [noise] um but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore that we're we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that next\nBig wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick ... is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
