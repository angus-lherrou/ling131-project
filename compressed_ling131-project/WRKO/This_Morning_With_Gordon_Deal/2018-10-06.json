tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex 'til many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody once this law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system has taken over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we're in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so\nUh there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm a NATO summit sometimes either
