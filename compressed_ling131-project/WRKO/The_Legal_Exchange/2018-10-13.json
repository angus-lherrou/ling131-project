{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Guinea I have to ask you a choir and a half\nSo ... for all your radio listeners out there Kenny has a fabulous spirit guide me right now is fabulous and I'm saying that because\nMy son and I both have no capability whatsoever of ever growing up here [laughter] but I wanted to ask you can tell you it's ... I Know you're doing this for a play yes but what are you doing about walking your daughter down the aisle are you going to\nHave to have to before my daughter Mars wedding I'm going to shave the play and Sunday and then following Saturdays Mars wedding so I guess is Sunday night Monday morning you know comes and does it hurt when you have something like that I you know I haven't grown it in about Twenty years or so so I forget I might even go to the barber and have them do it for\nI write I mean that's serious Tyler and I never have to worry about that you know we it's unbelievable I total jealousy speak more out of the hill\nOr you know it's a it's a hipster dad in Maine I might I I can grow it again so I could decide to after the wedding to to do it again\nNow do you have a big moment in this play is like a ... year\nOld they're all big moments and all around it okay okay I like that and we're where's this play being held\nHow is it the note employers which is actually technically a cat and um so yeah coming up the end of this month and what's what's the uh the ... the lion in winter\nOh yeah and I am the lions are you the lie on the menu of the aging king that well [laughter] no comment you say that if you are in the beard helps out a whole list is the only time will ever be the ... exact right oh so you might as well into exactly I Love that [laughter] anyway well\nLike I said that's great break a leg in a couple of weeks when it comes to that and definitely when you walk to your your daughter down the aisle that'll be fun\nDefinitely shave the beard for that showing up on me and recognize me I think back all the good for you good for you so but we talk about social talking about Social Security benefits and there is a a cola adjustment of living adjustment coming up this year of what's going on with the\nTwo point eight percent baby that's a big number down a good number especially when you think about\nAh last year it was two point oh it was point three percent and twenty Seventeen and it was the goose say wow twenty sixteen by the way whenever the coal adjustment is zero it wasn't a good year and the markets All right I think about it that way or the year before not in the markets why\nBecause if there's no need for cost of living adjustment that means there is no inflation if there was no inflation that probably means things weren't exactly humming along has so this year going into twenty Nineteen uh the the uh your cost of living increase for your benefits is going to be two point eight percent you're going to see that in January\nA and you know the good news here as this increase maybe even felt more by retirees because the overall price increases in in the past year have been concentrated in energy cost including gas instance retirees\nYou know they don't have to commute to jobs daily they may feel less of a burden associated with what happened with your car and the other thing I'm is at the pace of price increases for medical care has ease since twenty sixteen\nAnd so that grew slower than inflation\nDuring the same period of time so both those things could mean that this two point eight percent actually means that retirees are actually gaining on it a little bit off and they will actually stay more than we've inflation potentially ahead of inflation as it relates to the basket of goods and services that they're actually consuming with their\nPayments and the older you and I get the ... more potential we are paying to those\nWhile that's going to say on starting to focus on he was a little more at this point but we also talked earlier\nAbout the whole idea of what someone should pay for a financial advisor Wall Street journal had an article discussing this\nUm ... you are financial advisors so let's talk about that in contact with how you charge your clients from is this is really something that I think people are always thinking what should this cost me ... or what am I paying other hidden fees\nWhat's reasonable and all that kind of stuff and and you know this is a along with everything else in the investment business it's going in the right direction for the consumer okay meaning\nYou know whether it's mutual fund expenses are trading costs you'll some trading costs are going down to zero yeah uh and even hedge funds who are notorious for very heavy fees\nAnd not only are they disclosing their fees but they're reducing their fees as well and you know that trend has not evaded traditional investment advisors including people like me so some of the pressure is coming from robo advisers which are you know if you will technology solutions for people\nUm that offer\nA investment advice for the mass market for example vanguard awful offers robo advice for point three percent of your balance per year now this is fine for people with very simple portfolios or one portfolio and they want to just trust it to a robotic advisor in other words a formula\nUm but that isn't uh what what uh many many people choose to do because their financial plan their financial advice is far more complex than just trusting at two artificial intelligence and if you will\nA a robot well used to call it active management if it's being managed\nBy robots no well yes and no it's active\nIn that it's not just using index is necessarily a and if it's it depends what the artificial intelligence is doing if it's purely using index funds then no no it's not acting\nOn the other hand if it's buying and selling and and doing something other than what an index would do and that's no longer past events active and and I would say\nDepends on what the robo advisers doing\nSo let's just talk about what the current fees are then for people like me human based financial advisors that provide an array of services to our clients part of which of course and very important part of which is managing their investment portfolio but it's also\nHelping as it relates to putting together a total financial plan for them helping them with how much they should contribute to their various plans\nAs well as making sure that their trust and tax strategies are all in line as well as legal and tax strategies are on line as well to protect everything that they're trying to do while minimizing taxes\nRight now currently two thirds of investors\nWith approximately one and a half million dollars in assets\nPay humid advisors between one the one point five percent of their assets annually according to sue Rowley associates thoroughly as a consulting firm are located here in Boston one third pays less than that\nAnd the average rate is about one percent for that amount of assets so if you've got to call it a million and a half box a million a million and a half\nBlocks around one percent of the average and the great majority peso merging one for one and a half percent if you have assets in that in that amount now if you're a smaller town say a hundred three hundred thousand dollar balance\nOn average people pay about one point three percent for a an asset base of between one hundred and three hundred thousand dollars and by the way that's primarily dispersed between one to one point seven five percent okay\nAnd clients on the other hand with you know very large accounts safe five million dollars in assets they pay about point eight percent of assets on average would only twenty three percent paying one percent or more okay\nSo you know the lion's share are just under one percent there are people with five million box\nAnd our fees are absolutely in line with the industry um but investors should also by the way make sure that their financial advisor is using the lowest cost investment vehicles available to effectively\nImplement their strategy let me explain that so you got a financial advisory fee and in this case we're saying\nWe got a million a million and a half bucks should be about one percent but on top of that\nYou should make sure that the underlying investment vehicles that are being used in your account are low cost vehicles for example we use individual stocks and bonds when possible since they have no ongoing management fees if we purchased a mutual fund or an ATF\nWe make sure it's the lowest cost version of the vehicle both from an ongoing expense ratio\nAs well as the void in all sales ... sales charges front and back and loads and\nMake sure that you asked about the expense ratio of your investment portfolio if the weighted average for your portfolio say above point five percent\nThen you're likely paying more than one and a half percent in total fees including adviser fees and that can start to become a significant drag on your portfolio perform shore okay right so think about it this way if you've got a million a million and a half box\nThen maybe one percent for your advisor fees and I would say probably no more than point five percent\nIn addition to that for the underlying expenses of the of the investments that you're also in total expenses about what you know should be less than are equal to one and a half percent that's probably good guideline for that level of assets\nSo do you think most clients ask their financial advisor what am I paying is that something you address on friday I should be something you should address up front but to actually do that\nYou know they should the short answer I can tell you we make a point of telling our clients exactly what they're paying not only that were fee based advisor and as a result of all we're going to charge them is that if you will one percent for a million bucks but also\nUm we make sure that we identify for them that were choosing the lowest cost underlying investment vehicles and I can assure you our our cost as well below point five percent for any kind of a portfolio we're managing for our clients at this point\nOnce again post over number eight eight eight nine seven two seven five to six eight eight eight nine seven to plan or you can go online to plan strong dot com fall enjoy this fall weather and we'll see you next week I Can't wait Kenny daycare is the plans drawing for national for [noise]\nPurchasing annuity yeah thrown investment company you could actually lend money not to to a family member\nSo you give them the money yeah and then they use that money obviously to pay you back mhm uh under the terms of a promissory note well obviously these promissory note terms have to have certain rules that you have to follow much\nLike the annuity very specific requirements they have to be correct so remember before you think about the annuity one somebody should be in the nursing home yeah obviously you've got to make sure that Smith you also go to make sure that you've met the other requirements so for a single person that after the a promissory note is established\nThat you have either if you're single less than two thousand dollars\n... otherwise you'll be over assets right and then you'd be denied when you apply for Medicaid because you have too many dollars not because you did a promissory right\nSo you want to make sure that after the promissory note is done you have less than two thousand dollars if you're single\nOr if you're married the community spouse has less than a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars right 'cause I remember is the community spousal resource allowance that you're allowed to keep a when one spouse goes into the nursing home so why would you want to do a ...\nI'm Sorry no versus an annuity like we are an insurance company I'm definitely going to get to that I just want to explain what a promissory note is how it works and then you had an annuity and how it works and then I Want to compare the two okay so those are some things otherwise also make sure your monthly income\nIs not larger than the Medicaid rate\nAnd again remember the payments from the promissory notes some of it will be interest some of it will be return of principle so that won't be income right okay\nSo great so those are three basic requirements before you would even think about doing ... or a promissory note or an annuity mhm remember even with the annuity you're going to want to make sure that you're you're a community spousal resource allowances met and your two thousand dollar\nAsset limit for a single person is Matt\nAnd this is you would use either one of those when you have too many assets and you're in everything over\nThere right in front amounts I got a ... and also it's it's these are the dollars that you can keep everything over that is considered an excess resource\nAnd you would be denied medicate yeah because everything over two thousand dollars is so excessive right the state is just crazy craziness so if you're single and you have more than two thousand you're denied that's why you think about this if you're married and you have more than a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars\nFor the community spouse than you are denied right okay so\nHow does it what is the no I have to say itself to uh to work one it needs to be actual warily sound mhm what is that what does that and so it needs to pay out over the life expectancy of the borrower\nOkay so you can't take out a note that is longer than the life expectancy of couldn't be a thirty mile promissory note if someone's in their eighties right okay that's exactly right you have to look up these tables that are put together and they'll tell us\nWhat the age life expectancy has it doesn't matter what your health is just matters you looked at age and then you look to life expectancy on the table and it tells you OK so like I think Seventy five year old is like twelve years okay just to give you an example\nNext so that's one number two\nThey must have level payments\nWhen I say level payments I mean payments that stays the same throughout the term of the loan okay monthly payments right and they got to start or you also can't have a deferred or balloon payment so the words you can start immediately yeah you got to start immediately you can't for\nAnd you can't have times where you're not paying was a big balloon payment at the end at the end All right\nIt's got to be level payments from beginning to end has to be actual warily sound\nAnd here's really the the the kicker the note itself must not preclude cancellation on death translate that to English for us which you yeah so what that means is\nThat if if you took out a twelve year I'll take my Seventy five year old person for example and you took out a twelve year a promissory note right at that point you would have to you would have twelve years of payments right so during that time you you must continue to make the payments\nAnd let's say you died a three years in yeah to a twelve you know you had a stroke and died\nThat no can't terminate in other words it must continue to make payments for that individual so now where where to pay it would pay to the estate perhaps right of the deceased person so keep that in mind can't just and okay so\nI suppose will and will talk about how that compares in contrast with an annuity\nAnd how leans on annuities exist okay so those are your three things actually early sound level payments throughout no deferred payments and make sure doesn't can select\nDeath and you know what folks Todd's

language that must be included in your area\nOn the air you're listening to Todd let the apartment with a law firm of pushing and do and I'm Susan Powers a financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group and we'll be right back with more on the legal exchange with toddlers ski\nTime now for Wall Street and we can move you look back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMake many of our listeners are approaching retirement and the next few years what does some of the key issues that we're seeing out there now\nWell you know saving for retirement can be quite difficult in require serious discipline but honestly the process of adjusting your portfolio\nFor retirement is one that requires an equally serious strategy that oftentimes overlooked you know for starters it's important to consider a few key factors such as life expectancy though you might need your retirement savings to last upwards of Thirty years or more these days the other big issue we frequently Caesar retires plan for other too much\nOr too little stock market volatility retirement\nYou're either stance can lead to detrimental results and retirement if you don't consider\nAll of the other related factors unfortunately there's just\nNot a good rule of thumb for you all retirees ... so what makes up a sound retirements strategy when you've formulated strategy definitely identify all of your potential income sources you don't want to take Social Security and pension into consideration first for instance and then during retirement is usually smart to\nThink about covering your essential day to day expenses but just regular fixed income sources\nAnd then when you're discretionary expenses commend those can be paid for you know well with other sources of assets or income there are a lot of factors to consider when developing our plans such as inflation healthcare costs market volatility insurance needs\nAnd that's just naming a few so with all these realities in mind we decided to put together a guide this month\nTo help address some of these initial questions when it comes to specifically preparing\nFor your retirement years the name of the guy to how to develop a retirement income strategist only available this month from the Armstrong advisory group\nThinks my folks to download a copy of this month guide how to develop a retirement income strategy visit our website Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street weaken review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan Powers [laughter] ...\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're talking will answer your questions about anything and everything that including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan\nComeback sign of a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Brian in Milton math and Brian writes\nMy sixty six year old wife was diagnosed with the progressive former Parkinson's disease about Eighteen months ago\nShe currently has an IRA valued at around two hundred thousand in listening to many of your past radio programs you've mentioned an emergency action of buying an annuity with all of the funds the IRA what are the mechanics of purchasing this annuity if and when necessary and is the annuity income protected or at rest\nRight in line boy and what we were just talking about\nYeah so that that's good and I know the last thing we we spent maybe more time on the promissory note side of the equation and\nYou know you probably could do as a promissory note side of the equation here as well but let's focus on the annuity since that was your question we spent time with the with the note but here's how the annuity would work so one\nYou know because it's an IRA I Want you to know that even though it's an IRA you could not have\nPlanned in advance for it so I don't want to tell anybody here that the planning in advance could help because IRAs cannot be put into trust in advance without paying a a exorbitant tax ...\nAnd even if there's going to be attacks do now I Would always wait to incur the tax until somebody is in the nursing home yeah I don't want to pay in advance and even then\nAnd I might have to ask some questions here although Parkinson's is not a disease that takes your life quickly\nSo it's likely that this is something that could be ongoing mhm right so I say that because even when somebody comes in and says you know we want to go on Medicaid in in a lot of their money is tied up in an IRA yet I still ask the questions about\nHow is the health of the person in the nursing home because now says right 'cause if it's going to be short term\nI'm not sure I Want to win the huge tax liability if I'm going to be paying more in taxes than I Would have paid the nursing home ... right so but I'm pretty sure in this case you know it's probably going to be long term so\nAnd the dollar amounts not overly large right so what happens\nThere's two hundred thousand dollars like when I was explaining the annuity in the prior segment\nIs going to put the community spouse over\nA hundred and twenty three six ... now I don't know what other assets are are but let's just assume for now there really isn't any maybe let's say maybe there's fifty grand mhm well the fifty grand and the bank account can go to the community spouse husband yeah in this case\nLeaving us with this two hundred thousand which is in her IRA exactly and that's the glitz you and that's the great question that that's here is this is in her IRA so she can't have more than two yeah so we need to get this out of her IRA you\nCan't have part of his one twenty three sex be left in her name and your IRA correct so that oh so you need to get it all out and to come out so that two hundred becomes what yeah when something no one can take the whole two hundred oh no no I Know but I have to pay the taxes on it\nRight so now the mechanics are you have to take it out because I Can't allocated to her a hundred and twenty as you're saying but in terms of the annuity I'm going to purchase yes yeah so I've got fifty and I'm going to take two hundred and put it over to her side of the ledger now as you said Susan when I Do that\nAnd I pull two hundred outta that Ira I'm going to create a income tax liability race\nGood news is maybe prior to going into the nursing home this year\nThis tax year they might have incurred some medical expenses ... if they did then this can offset oh yeah the ... tax hit but yes it will be a taxable event ...\nFor the individual yeah okay so now I pay the taxes and and let's say we we lose twenty grand in taxes mhm okay I don't know even if you're going to the top rate you know I I Can't imagine this going to put your morning the thirty percent bracket rail\nTwo times three sixty grand mhm so say say you lose fifty grand yet so you're down to a hundred and fifty plus you've got fifty mhm so now we're at two hundred thousand left yet\nWe know a hundred and twenty three six would be non accountable mhm so yes now that this community spouse has the money we can allocate it\nAnd then that leaves the excess the excess would then be a new attack about Seventy five grand in the face ... so then we would take the Seventy five grand and we would buy an annuity in the name of the healthy spouse and that would convert that asset into an income stream and it would\nWould the annuity company would pay a monthly check to the community spouse which is now non ... income right because it's converted to income now\nSick spouse can go on Medicaid and we've saved so in a minute not at risk for Brian because it's in his name is not going to be in his wife ... so the answer on that we converted to is not at risk anymore\nAnd you know what folks if you have been thinking about creating an area vocal track because you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide is going to be really helpful for you it's designing an income only eerie vocal trust in your trust is only as good as the drafting folks Todd's guide includes important language

Karen writes\nMy husband and I created revoke ... trust in two thousand and seven the attorney prepared deeds that transferred our home from joint tenants in the entirety to join tenants in common individually is this what you would recommend shouldn't the properties be transferred fifty fifty to our respective trust\n[noise] you know carrying I or Susan and care and I I have to tell you\nThat I have no idea what they're doing here I mean this is one of those things where I'm really just trying to scratch my head and see what do you actually gain from doing this if you have\nYou know revolt couple across I I don't look at things and just\nDecide that it's wrong I I really try to think about what the attorney might have been doing here\nWhat the attorney might have been thinking here I don't know so it if we have revolt will trust let me explain to you folks would I Would do and what I think should be done here\nSo when you create revoke about trust and you all your listeners may have these right so if you've got revoke about trusts\nThe goal is to fund those revoke ultra shares to put things into it [laughter] right like what like all your investment accounts not IRAs not for
