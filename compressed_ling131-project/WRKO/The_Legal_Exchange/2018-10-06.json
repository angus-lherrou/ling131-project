E. and their troubles one week later the c._e._o. gets fired and now there's a new sheriff in town G G E what's going on\nYou know whenever I think of a new sheriff in town I think a Blazing Saddles right you know I mean it was such a funny movie rights and and that actor did such a great job in that movie among ago my\nWhole thing was just a great movie of course I think almost all of its politically incorrect now I don't think they can probably show of it any more\nI think you can only say the word ... no I I just remember the beans ... of course you know around the fire I mean there there were so many funny and again this goes back to our youth maybe you can run for Supreme Court just no no I Can't I Believe me but anyway it's\nHappening it's G. E. and it and it's big and there is a new sheriff in town it's G. E. and it's in our next in our backyard editor and their unsteady unsteady to say the\nLeast yeah so John slant already who who had replaced Jeff him out as the c._e._o. and ... had been there for quite some time and had you know kind of a ...\nTo him that a lot of people thought was very attractive as you know he was an advisor to Brock Obama and he you know he was kind of a mover in shaker and\nI you know there are a lot of people that were drinking the Kool Aid while he was running GE um and and then um they turned it over to John ... was very much a different kind of a character is more of an internal guy he was you know kind of a bald guy was you know good looking tall guy and\nYou know ... it was more of an internal kind of operations guy to take over\nAnd he lasted all of fourteen months a CEO before the board decided he wasn't moving fast enough\nTo implement the broad restructuring plans that G. E. N. and by the way are not\nIncidentally he missed a whole bunch of important financial targets and you can't blame it all on the guy but at at the end it's the buck stops with him and they weren't getting the job done and they weren't doing the restructuring that had happened\nYou know let me explain to what she is trying to do at this point they're trying to spin off their health care business their oil business\nAnd one other business and at the same time they want to end up with just their power generation and their aviation businesses so they're they're trying to you know do very very big deal these are not small divisions major shifting absolutely and\nYou know the health care business has cost them immense amounts of money because\nYou know they they wrote all of these um long term care insurance policies and guess what people are living a lot longer they're going into nursing homes and living a lot longer all of that is so much more expensive\nThan they ever entertained before because the demographics have changed and frankly medical care is improved so much\nAir G. E. the great G. E. who\nAmong them did not know that we're living longer\nYeah and and they make a lot of the equipment to the diagnosis of it as well they say they should know amongst anyone but the the short answer is that they've gotten themselves into a real pickle and frankly a lot of it had to do you know don't forget in two thousand eight\nG capital should have ... down G capital had a whole bunch of those bad mortgages and the government is actually bailed him out\nAnd you you may remember Warren Buffett I'm invested five billion dollars at the time so they already had strike one there then they you know ... more recently they had this whole thing with the health care insurance and long term care insurance and huge liabilities there that they can't you know that they're very difficult for them to cover eat into all of their profits\nWhat's the end result the result is their stock price drop like a stone over the last couple of years and what did they do they finally they they set the flattery listen you've got to get this restructuring done we got to stop the bleeding we've got to offload some of these businesses and we got to move forward and ... didn't move fast enough for are they too big to fail\nThat while they were let me put it that way and they probably are they probably are too big to fail um they ... I'll tell you one thing Hank Paulson wasn't willing to let them fail in two thousand eight that's clear but that was because at that point they were more of a bank than anything else\nNow what's going to happen is Larry ... is the new CEO\nAnd this guy joined the B. O. D. as an outside director and he came from Dana her if there's one thing that Dana her is known for as those guys know how to do deals and they know how to do them fast because that's how they've grown and and kinda paired their business down is through the art of the deal so\nThey need right now to have the right person in the in in the right place and it seems this might be the right move\nFor a while and and guess what the ... the stock market noticed and agreed with you because what the stock market did was immediately\nThe stock was up eight percent to twelve dollars a share ... upon the news of of ah Larry called being hired and it's now trading north of that is in the twelve fifty rents got a long way to go it's especially down over half in the last year\nBut and there's a very very important stock but at the same time I think they're finally doing the right thing here jeeze got there got their work cut out for him and they need somebody like this guy to make it happen\nWe're going to keep an eye on GE we're going to keep an eye on their new CEO and it'd be as we do that we're going to look at another CEO that can't seem to get his foot out of his mouth [laughter] seems as just stopped doing the wrong thing\nBig troubles lots of headline news he lawn mosque sued by the FCC but he reached an agreement shortly thereafter what is going on with our smoking electric car friend\nWell can I I forgot about the smoking oh my that is so funny so let me tell you something his first inclination when the when the FCC said they were going to come in and and and uh take action against them like he wanted to fight it and he said to his board either you fight it or all resign immediately\nAnd then what happened was when he took that position over that weekend stock futures dropped twelve or Fifteen Percent and he saw in writing that\nYou know it was going to impact a lot more than him it was going to packed everybody if if they took that stance and so he revise this position\nThey came to a preliminary agreement on this past Monday and you know just for those of you that have been only following the cabin on trial and don't know what's going on with Ilan must he pulled one of the most bone headed moves I've ever seen a ... a CEO do and that was\nA several weeks ago he tweeted a in the middle of the night he tweeted I'm\nA I'm thinking about taking Tesla private right up a funding secured at four hundred and twenty bucks share now the stock was trading at three hundred three fifty a share at that point and he said that that's a public company that's a ... and he's the the L cannot do that so he did that\nAnd the stock went up to three Seventy or so\nAnd then it became clear he didn't have the funding secured and ultimately the stock dropped down to three hundred bucks a share and so you you know she really created a mess you could certainly say it was fraudulent what he said because he didn't have the funding secured\nWe just discuss G. E. and how the wrong CEO can make a stock sink very quickly Iran mosque was really built him in the stock was not really the car the stock with him yeah you're absolutely\nRight and now the start going down as really hit that's exactly right where does this go with him well does it stay does the stocks go up because he leaves no she doesn't know possible to think oh no so he has to say he's got to stay there and now people have to have faith\nWhile they have to have faith and they have to have the right new chairman\nA working with him to to kind of rain him and certainly from a communications perspective they asked if somebody who ran submitted a bit\nBecause this is we've just you know he's just settled with the SEC and the SEC by the way we're really kind to him and I don't say that often the SEC ... let him away with a frankly a slap on the wrist forty million dollars in fines\nYou know he can't be the ... you can't be the chairman of the board for three years but he can still stay on the board I mean these are minors slaps\nWhat are the chances the FCC does something like this make some minor move because they know he's such a major player in the stock market\nI think it's very likely I think you know they say they're apolitical they say that they don't look into this stuff I have to tell you I think if you are I did this uh we'd be removed from the position exactly businesses business businesses business but\nUm this is just the beginning I mean he's got a lot more fish to fry here you know he also has a criminal investigation or he's got civil suits\nOh so this is just one obstacle that he's gotten out of the way or the other thing I should say is after this deal was struck this preliminary deal was struck this past week I Can't believe it but the guy came out on Thursday\nAny any taunted the SEC and that the tweet he said was let me say that the short seller enrichment commission is doing incredible work\nHe that's the acronym for the SEC and he's saying there is there to help the short sellers against him\nInflation bio to speak so since Nineteen eighty two to two thousand seven the CPI consumer price index has risen about three percent on average\nVersus the elderly population three point three percent a sort of what their spending and where there was where they're headed plot\nSide of me because the health care costs right they're spending more and healthcare\nIt is sixty five and over ... and you hit the nail on the head expect to spend two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars on health care if you're sixty five and over and retiring and guess what that does not include\nLong term care ... nursing home cause yeah that's that's a bonus yeah okay so that's where the out nursing homes so that is up six percent from a year early\nNow the thing that's being missed here is that the elderly population spends Fifteen Percent on medical care whereas the regular urban worker spend seven percent\nSo it's it's skewed right in terms of what's happening so and finally Medicare part B has increased a hundred and Ninety five percent from two thousand to today\nIt went from forty five dollars and fifty cents to a hundred and thirty four dollars so\nFairly certain that your coal adjustment is going to be wiped out by the Medicare part B increased yeah but you know at least ... something folk so I just wanted to give you that's more of a an F. Y. segment if you will yeah\nAnd you know if you think about that two hundred and Seventy five thousand I think you said the average person will spend on those healthcare costs\nEven if you are in a more reasonable nursing home to her and it's ten thousand dollars a month and I'm only taking that for because it's easy math for me right you know what they're using them as high as sixteen grand a month here in Massachusetts so\nAt a hundred and twenty thousand plus per year how quickly are your assets going to be wiped out if you and your spouse\nOr go into a nursing home or you or your spouse we had we do certainly do have clients who are both positive have ended up in the air and it's it's not it's not on site but it can happen\nBut I don't have to be the same time it could be one and then another Clinton leaving their plan for both\nAnd you know what a lot of people don't do their planning in advance and maybe we can just kind of remind folks Todd that what we mean when we talk about doing advanced planning which is what's outlined in this guide in terms of timelines\nShore well if you're going to do your advanced planning it's still the five year rule and it's good to bring that up occasionally because I'm Still getting people out there who will tell me oh I heard it's going to be seven I I heard it's going to be ten yeah you know I haven't heard that lately folks I Know there was a bill many years ago where they propose that I'm pretty sure it's dead in committee\nAnd I'm not trying to scare people but five years is still five years mhm and and I would hurry I Would get my ball rolling\nAnd what we're talking about putting in these trust when we talk about funding the trust I mean your your primary residence as a no brainer but there are assets that can't be protected right in the U.S trust\nThat is true and so what you're not going to put in these trust would be things like IRAs four oh one case\nAny kind of a retirement account that requires minimum distributions to come out or that is not taxed yet ... and the reason is you can't put them in because if you reach in to pull them out\nYou have an income taxable event mhm so you're not going to take five hundred thousand dollars out of your Ira and put it in a trust and give the government forty percent right you just won't do it so that's money you live on first\nAnd that you spend down for us because that money is going to be continued to be at risk or the inexpensive\nAnd live on it that's why it's there that's why you saved it put the other assets in the real estate the vacation home the rental property your taxable investment accounts put those in the trust and and I think that's important and and um are these the kinds of things that we we talk about right not just how to\nCrawl around his stuff as in the guy but I don't really find that the Russians how to fund the trust what type of assets go in there what type of acids don't go in there you know there is there's a whole there's a couple of pages about\nProblematic trust provision so for folks who are out there that already have a trust this is a good sanity check for them to say wait a minute I have this paragraph or I have this paragraph you don't want to find out when you're going into the nursing home that you have a troublesome trust\nRight so look at the different kinds of paragraphs that are in there and and you know what we can talk about funding and that's certainly important I think the lay person who might not have a trust or who might have a trust on already might not understand what to look for in the document I think this these paragraphs will help you\nKnow they'll they'll they'll still stand out when yeah getting through yours and folks if you haven't done your document planning yet right\nIf you if you read this you'll see what to look for in the document draft that the attorney gives you ...\nIt's a great guideline it's a great starting point to educate yourself and how these trust operate on a day to day basis all of these wary wary causes that are included in a lot of trust that just don't hold up\nTodd does this for a living day in and day out he is your subject matter

the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMike Lee just entered the last quarter of the year and investments often associate the month of October would pour stock market returns how are things looking for this year\nYeah you know you're right October's oftentimes singled out for poor performance that mainly has to do with some of the particularly severe stock market crashes we've seen in the past\nYou know as negative sentiment reflects historic crash the Nineteen twenty nine eighty seven\nAnd then of course most recently in October of two thousand eight when the Dow collapsed the full Eighteen percent in a week which by the way was the single worst we can do history going all the ... back in Ninety One in addition yes involves October months are back in Seventy eight Seventy nine in Nineteen eighty nine all of which add to this negative October sentiment so I'm sure some\nOf this is coincidence is there anything different about twenty team though\nYou know there is I mainly that we're in a midterm election year and that changes a lot you know if you look back to Nineteen fifty they're Seventeen different mid term election years and you'll find that the Dow average the three point one percent gain in those specific mid term October months\nIn fact of the Seventeen election years twelve of them ended with a positive stock market return they're taking this a bit further mid term elections seem to be a positive indicator for the stock market over the next three quarters the nine months stretch from October before mid term election and then June after the election is produced average returns of twenty point four percent of the doubt\nAnd Twenty one point one percent for the S. and P. five hundred and that goes do straight back to Nineteen forty nine so we all know the past performance can be used to predict future results but I Would pump the brakes if you associate October with only negative market returns because history does tell us otherwise\nThanks like folks if you have questions about the markets the economy or your portfolio please visit us that Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with ... and Susan Powers [laughter]\n...\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan followers\nBack to I have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from David in Framingham mass in David writes my father has been in ... in a nursing home in on Medicaid for the past year and I've been maintaining his home by paying the taxes utilities and maintenance\nSocial Ming houses in his name and dad's name I guess us pay ya\nI don't want to do anything to jeopardize his Medicaid eligibility but I cannot afford to keep doing this and the house is worth around five hundred thousand what am I options [noise]\nWow [noise] that's a that's a nice size house I'm well here you go folks let's let's explain let's delve into this a question a little deeper a first of all you know the the first thing that comes to my mind is you know how to ah get eligible for Medicaid when he has a house right\nRemember folks own past shows we have spoken about how a home is a non accountable asset as long as is located in math and you're single and check the box that I intend to return home\nAnd it's under eight hundred and fifty roughly eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars of assets of value mhm he's there so folks that's a message to all of you as to how he's on Medicaid even though he has this home\nSo for all of you who have not done planning a that is at least a way of still getting on Medicaid so I I\nI get that he's also absolutely right that as a single person\nSomebody's got to pay the maintenance and upkeep of that house right keep the heat on well that's the kids ... kids I I don't know what your financial options are but let me give you a little motivate motivate motivation here and that would be\nIf she passes away\nAnd you get the house you're gonna have a five hundred thousand dollar home with no mortgage fry and with a step up and basis so you could actually sell this for five hundred thousand dollars in have zero\nZero capital gains tax and zero estate tax mhm federal and state so it is a big win right even if I had to get a mortgage now or a home equity line of credit just to pay a little bit so sometimes you need to understand that I can take out a he lock on my own home get a tax deduction\nAnd use this money in and sit in a in a bucket just to make these you know what is it costs to maintain that house ten grand a year I don't know\nBetween taxes depending on where it is yeah taxes and keep utilities on and so that's probably high so so that's one option that is one mortgage out on his own home so that he can pay yeah the ... the only other option and that's the one I'm leaning towards\nThe only other option here folks would be to sell the house which you absolutely can do and if you sell the house or you could you could take the money or probably get there might be a tax on a vacation number one\nCause if you sell it and dad gets a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar capital gains exclusion there might be more than two hundred and fifty thousand of gain built into the house right so you might have a capital gains tax liability don't know got to run those numbers\nEven at that though Todd now dad's got a big bucket calf\nShe's going to be booted off Medicaid unless you can either buy on Medicaid annuity your throat into a pool trust mhm so not a great option\nRight Alan keep it how else could you keep it you could rent it\nOkay so if you rent it out now you'll have the money you need to pay the bills because while that will be rental income for dad yeah income is treated differently than an asset so renting it is not going to cause him to come off Medicaid\nAnd let's say you rent it you get to use the rent dad gets to use the rent to pay all the bills and only the excess rent\nWould end up going to the nursing home and you don't care 'cause that somebody else's money right and now the child the child's ability to borrow or pay for this property\nIs gone mhm it will be maintained especially with no debt right you know it will be maintained by the rent mhm you would definitely be able to generate enough rent\nTo maintain the property with excess rent going to the nursing home to pay a bill and that will help\nTo reduce the amount of the lean that's been placed on that home 'cause it's he's qualify for Medicaid so that will help you in the end as well so good\nPoint Susan what Susan's talking about there is that even though this house for a single person is non accountable\nIs Lena bull mhm so that means whatever amount of money the state is paying yeah on behalf of dad in this case is a lean on the house and so if we have Social Security of two thousand going too\nA nursing home and now we can pick up a thousand a month extra on the rent yeah the ... rent mhm now there's three thousand dollars a month going so the amount the state is paying drops from four to three right and so the lean is less I say four to three because full pay on Medicaid is about six ... so\nThat's a great that's a ... I mean when I Would do or here or rent it David so rent that out down by the way to guys\nFolks if you would like to not have to worry about this last minute ... that you have to do with your assets do your planning in advance\nTodd has written a guide for all of us designing an income on your income only ... trust and it is the type of trust you need if you want to protect those assets from those long term care expenses\nGet your free copy right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com or you can download your free copy\nTodd our last question comes from Brian in ... math and Brian writes my father died in a nursing home and twenty Seventeen while receiving Medicaid and the state contacted me with a bill for his nursing home care\nCan they make me pay the bill he gave me is home seven years before he went into a nursing home and only held the life a state other than that he didn't own anything the bill was around sixty five thousand do I need to pay this\nYou know this is a great question and folks what they're driving it here and what Brian is sort of bringing to the forefront is\nThis thing called a state recovery mhm right ... we just talked about how they could have been a lean on a person's house right and when he died the state would say okay kids you're going to get a bill for what we paid\nBehalf of the person who was in the nursing home that being said they're going to say you need to pay us because we have a lean on your on dad's house because that in that previous example owned it in his name\nAgain d'alene was a friend that was still weigh less that would be do and you got to keep the house uh\nSo you know take out a mortgage and pay it or sell it and pay it either way a note taxable event\nIn this case this was the same thing so she had been in a nursing home and they've been paying and now they're looking to say is there anything available for eh state recovery to reimburse the state for the money paid on behalf of a dad in this case [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Legal Exchange", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
