{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Economy's doing I think the market's doing because the your assessment of the overall economic and market landscape should really drive your overall investment allocation so do you want to be a a neutral Woodstock sources bonds versus cashed\nYou want to be overweight stocked it would it be underway stocks and so forth a huge part of that should be dependent on what is your outlook for the economy at this point what's your outlook for the market at this point what's your what's your sense evaluations and self and listen by\nFar and away the biggest concern of investors right now is a calming at some point market down turn to the question is when and how much more is there to go and you know that we're late in the cycle how do you not go to ...\nTo early right because you don't think of it this way\nIf you go to defense too early I'll give you the red Sox analogy if you if you want to defense too early and you didn't it didn't wash and stay up for the last inning of the game last couple of Red Sox games that you would have missed a couple a really nice home runs right sure\nAnd so the question is should you stay around for those later innings and do they make a bigger a make a big impact to your overall investment performance in your financial portfolio and no no uh no surprise there they actually do in a substantial so come to that and I met so let's first talk about some key metrics\nTo think about when you're trying to a fast overall what's the economic\nEnvironment right now first of all\nEconomic growth has good GDP Growth is good and has been accelerating lately so check on that one okay good economic growth employment is really go yeah unemployment's nearer fifty year old low right and there are many more open positions now than there are unemployed people\nOkay think about that third inflation it's Goldilocks we've been talking about this for weeks and weeks now core inflation to point two percent right wage growth rate where you kind of want to see it and at least\nYou know when you look at the causes of the lower wage growth ... doesn't concern you as much because some of it at least has to do with retiring baby boomers and then them being replaced by lower wage earning younger people that that is not oh wages are being artificially suppressed its a demographic issue is that right\nSo so far economic growth good check employment unbelievably good\nInflation goldie locks right how about corporate ...\nWhat do you think about those ... those were the great height right and and earnings per share is going to grow twenty to twenty five percent this year after really good growth last year and and you know the only warning on the horizon there is\nTwenty Nineteen we're gonna see deceleration an earnings growth and the question is how much deceleration\nSo that's one that you say really good now but ... let's keep our eye out not going to the future what else do you want to think about when you think about stocks will have a valuations if if if you've got a great environment but they're already priced through the roof there's nothing left to get\nRight on the buyer's have already bought\nBut valuations right now are not excessive\nIn fact the forward price earnings multiple ... five hundred it's now just under sixteen times earnings and you know what that is that's below the twenty five your average is sixteen point one okay okay so valuations ... not too expensive they are not cheap but they're certainly not excessively expensive point\nHow about the fed this is something that people talk about all the time or oh well as the fed going to come in and raise rates to fashion squashed\nThey're saying oh that is going to be the end of it well the fed is being very patient normalizing policy I don't believe Donald Trump would agree with you [laughter] that's true [laughter] that that's very possible but the the fed right now here's an here's some data you know that I use when I I say a statement like that\nTo the fed is raising rates at a rate of about one percent a year right now twenty five bases point move for me right so called one percent a year\nI think about what they've done typically after other recessions they raised them usually two and a half\nPercent a year and okay so when I say they're raising rates and they're being very patient the way they're normalizing look at the day okay they're ... they're raising rates at about a forty forty percent rate compared to how they usually do it not nearly as fast as they normally go so that's good news\nAbout global growth global growth is relatively balanced at the same time you know you've got developed countries\nThey are continuing to expand nicely\nOn an even emerging economies are slightly expanding or at least they're not contracting\nThere is no yellow or red on the grids that I'm looking at the U.S all green at this point although the emerging economies are growing as fast\nAs uh the the developed economies are so if you get on that list of what six or seven key metrics when you try to evaluate yeah hey what's the state right now you know in in weather terms I Would say it's sunny and then the sunny investment environment for now and and maybe the\nOnly cloud that that you know I've mentioned so far is this idea of ... D celebrating earnings a little bit you know at some point does it run out of gas simply because we've gotten so much earnings rose in twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen and we'll let you know go on to twenty Nineteen certainly not the same level as twenty Seventeen and twenty eight\nOf course things are not always sunny or the ball here on the one that's for darn sure I was on the rise and then\nAnd there are are some clouds and I I Would not want to make people think that there aren't there certainly are and in in addition to this idea that earnings eventually earnings growth eventually is going to de celery extra and the question is how much but there are other things as well certainly trade tensions right because terrorists don't benefit\nAnybody right in the short term they hurt they hurt whoever is applying the tariff and they hurt hurt whoever ah is is trying to buy the good you're both of them are miserable okay so that's and that's certainly not how a helping in the short term but longer term it may be actually advantageous but not in the short term\nEmerging market countries are showing signs of strain because\nYou've got a stronger dollar and too much dollar denominated debt that they have on their own bucks right okay so\nEmerging markets not doing as well as you'd like to see him you certainly of American politics in the middle of yeah you do and you know I can talk about what's going to happen in the next election but here's what I think is going to happen we're going to have divided government\nAnd divide government's going to be okay and that means no big policy moves are going to occur uh and so\nAt least for the shorter term I don't see big risk associated with American politics but there could be really big changes coming in twenty twenty including health care for all and bigger deficits\nIf for example the Democrats get the presidency and both both sides of the ... of the house and Senate\nSo at least shorter term I don't see that being a risk for longer term a little bit more of an issue there and then finally cornering so the question is our current earnings kind of at peak you know that they're they're already built on record margins it's fully ... full employment\nA and a big reason for a margin levels is lower taxes\nAnd that could evaporate as well if you know the Democrats come in and they turn around the tax bill now they can't\nDo that with a split house and Senate ah and and a Republican president and they can't even do it um ... unless they got a two thirds of the house and two thirds of the Senate which is numerically impossible in the short term but I but I have to tell you it is something to worry about for twenty twenty\nSo what's an appropriate investing strategy and fall looking at the environment does you see it using all your metrics what does it mean for investors\nWell as I said first of all it's a sunny investing environment right now and there are few clouds but they're kind of on the horizon they're certainly not you know coming in anytime soon\nAnd and J. P. Morgan Chase actually use is a very good expression here they they say make hay and fix the roof at the same time in other words a wild ... while the sun's shining it means invest for growth but also prepare for a downturn at the same time okay\nAnd you know that's the reason you want to do that the reason you still want to invest for growth is because in the late innings of a bull market historically significant returns have been earned right up to the peak of the market let me just give me an example of that you know the average return six months before the market peak\nIs Fifteen Percent so if you stay in that last six months you will have historically have earned an extra\nFifteen Percent that's not that's not the last five percent that's Fifteen Percent so staying in the market has real benefits are as you approach the peak and getting out too early can be costly\nThe other side of the coin though\nIs wild growth equities have outperformed year to date value stocks historically out perform in a downturn and so you know you need to think to yourself and might too overweight in growth stocks at this point because when this thing turns the best way to protect myself\nIs in more value stocks at least based on historical results\nIn the end the punch line is a balanced portfolio tends to do well compared to other asset classes at this late stage of the investing a cycle and as a result rebalancing is really important now and probably more towards a more neutral asset allocation at this point all still\nDo them as a matter of course right we look at the clients assets that type of assets the dollar value of the assets the age of the client and the family dynamics of the client and all of that factors into whether or not\nThe recommendation of an irrevocably trust might be there\nBecause I Know when you sit down people Todd you go through all of their objectives right in a nursing home planning and protection isn't one of them you don't discuss theory they'll they'll try\nI think you're right Susan when you said they're object 'cause I I use the word recommendation and and we don't really tell people whether they should protect us from a nursing right they need to decide if that's important to them\nOh I went through this with this particular client and they did seem to want to protect us from the nursing home but when I looked at the numbers they were worth about six million mhm no never mind the six million isn't what's putting the off four point five million of it was\nIn an Ira wow I said\nI Can't do Medicaid planning for you was for a million dollars in an IRA and I explained to them right even if you wanted to protect the other two property such a hat and some other money\nWhich we could do you'll never be eligible for Medicaid mhm because of the Ira\n... and even if I was to try to do the Ira last minute planning which is the only thing we can do for IRAs and we've explained that on the show we can do last minute planning for an Ira but in this case it was his and if he got sick and went in the nursing home in order for me to a movie Ira permissible early to the healthy spouse\nI'd have to cash it out oh and think about that tax bill if they weren't millions on point four million I ran a numbers I said there's no way we're going to write a check for one point four million just so I can get you his Ira start paying the nursing home because even if he lives three years at fourteen thousand a pop it's like four fifty\nYeah I Can't stomach one point four million in tax you know and then can you imagine if you made the transfer thinking he's going to live a while and six months later he has some catastrophic something happens in the nursing home and he dies right now you spent one point four million in taxes when you would not have needed to do that\nRight and that money coming out of the IRA although normally it's taxable completely when you take that money out of the IRA in this case if they are private private pay were tiny arraigned money tax benefit\nAs right Susan you'll get a ... for\nThe uh for the money you're using just spend on the nursing home so you're actually believing it out almost not quite tax free but now just about yeah get a big deduction for your um medical expense so yes I think we educate we don't advocate one over the other it's very important to you come in and see where you're at\nSo we know that you can't put those IRA acids whether it's traditional area Roth IRA although you don't have the tax implication of Iraq I re but\nAnything that's still in that IRA rapper cannot go into that tries not not in advance you know what else would you put into the trust while you're going through this process for someone who is in heavy on the IRA side they decide they want to do their evoke about transplanting what kind of assets would you actually transfer into that\nThis this well when now let's go to someone who who is more of the everyday client right you you got three million unless you're likely to be there's really no question that you you'll probably concerned about nursing home care right and so now you've got that vacation home your primary residence those are two usually big assets that people want to protect\nThey can go in ... right and usually they're there's also maybe an investment portfolio\nThey would want to put some of that and that can go in ... not the Ira but the taxable investment portfolio\nOr even a or even a rental property 'cause remember when you put the rental property and you still get the right to the income right so it's still yours you haven't given it away in that regard and so yeah they can put the rental property and and and get that protected so pretty much anything you want to protect other than the Iran and put in\nWhich is great so you you have that flexibility get that clock start and you know what it's it's really about education this whole process tied everything that we do on this show is to educate people even if it's when they go and sit down with someone else another attorney to get their ... their documents drafted\nIn the back of their mind they can be thinking\nHuh I don't think that's what Todd\nSaid oh no they are able to do so we know that there's a lot of bad legal advice out there yet and lay and and I think part of the reason\nWe this this do we do this article this way is it it does provide you with some of that information about how to begin the process how to decide what belongs in what doesn't belong in things like that so ... and\nHow to to know when to do it right I had a forty nine year old couple of come in now they got young kids miners you know this is not yeah not ready\nFor that yet you need to do regular estate planning and they

with more on the legal age change with Todd let ski\nTime now for Wall Street we can move you look back at the markets performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong\nMy currently interest rates are on the rise in in the past three weeks alone the ten year treasury has jumped from two point nine nine percent to three point to three percent now we've kind of settled back down around three point one five percent do you think this is a sign for investors to pull out of the stock market\nYou know you're right in the streets are on the rise but it's really not being out of the norm or a ... three two three is actually below historical average\nFor the tenure treasury but you know thanks to a decade a very low interest rates following the owner and financial crisis the economy has become accustomed to these low rates which is why we saw the large sell off in the stock market the last couple of weeks contrary to popular belief\nStocks don't always fall when interest rates rise you know rates typically rising the economy is strong which is also the main driver of equity returns according to parents have been\nFifteen periods in the past sixty five years when rates have risen in stocks have gained with average gains reaching twelve and a half percent and they're only been three instances and those rising rate environments when stocks of actually fallen\nSo what sector is can we invest in that could actually benefit from a rising interest rate environment\nWell I mean one sector that benefits typically from rising and straight as financial ah banks make money by you know buying deposit cheaply and then selling them for higher prices while higher interest rates will force them to pay more for deposits interest rates on savings accounts and other consumer products typically rise much slower\nThan interest rates on loans you know the average rate on a one year CD for instance climbed from point to seven to point seven eight and started sixteen whereas the home equity line of credit rate went from four six nine to six point one nine percent\nThanks my folks if you have questions about the market about the economy or about your portfolio please visit us it Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street weaken review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with time ... and Susan Powers [laughter]\n...\nListening to the legal exchange and it's done for us to this and we were talking a little answer your questions about anything and everything will be glued to me is they blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Bob in Boston mass imbibe rights I'm interested in protecting my sons inherited his inheritance from creditors however if he remains married and then ... says his wife\nHow can I include her and my plan [laughter] so that she would receive something after he dies but keep the majority of the assets interest from my grandkids so he wants to include the daughter in law and his plan\nThis is very strange\n[laughter] well um I I said I don't really feel the same way yeah [laughter] but\nYou know I mean I I Do\nUnderstand that you know you you think\nYou know that you want to you know you love your in laws and even though you really only think your love your in laws are but\nAnd and you want to try to take care of and it's kinda hard to have your cake and eat it too though [laughter] so what I Would what I Would think you would have to do is you would just have to say that you know upon I think in in the trust Bob you create you would say upon my death\nYou know if my son is married ... make sure they're married on the date of death right so if my son is married to acts on the date of death than I Want to carve out you know a percentage some percentage to\n... her just give it to her you know a little piece and even even if the sun's living 'cause they'll share together mhm right if if if\nIt's something you want her to have and you ... and since you want her to have it you really don't care about it being\n... the divorce comes or not you don't care because you're giving it to her than than than give it to her and then her but even if the sun's living they can enjoy it together yeah\nBut if they get a divorce or whatever you gave to your daughter in law would be subject to the divorce which means your son would get half\nAnd she would get half so it's not horrific ... as long as you put a percentage on the amount you want to go to her\nAnd then you say the balance of the assets so say I carve out ten percent of my state mhm I Want you know ten maybe even five percent I Won five percent of my assets are and and maybe you would even limited you might not want real estate to get involved here so you might say I want five percent of my non\nA real estate trust assets yeah\nTo go to a share for the benefit of my uh daughter in law provided she is married to my son on the date of my death ...\nUh and that share can be paid out directly to her again\n... if they're married and sons living than they have it together so it's kinda like you gave it to your son right no different than if you paid it out to your Sunday would share it yup same idea\nOkay so that's off the table then the balance of the trust assets Ninety five percent of what's left ... would be held in this\nTrust designed for future creditor protection divorces and bloodline planning down to the grand kids which is what he's asking about here so I think Bob you're going to have to get the lawyer to get some creative drafting\n[noise] but I have yet to come across the situation that we could not accomplish one way or another you just have to understand the pros and cons of doing it\nI Would not want to put it all in the divorce proof language trust where it's supposed to pay out in the trustees discretion for the don't or or for the children and the grandchildren and the spouse of the sun\nTo me that just smells really bad ... I mean if the divorce comes later and she says her attorney takes a look at that language right and she says you know I'd like half\nOf what's in that trust that Bob put together yet right and Bob says well it's not mine or ours we always have to ask the disinterested trust the for the distribution I suppose the disinterested trustee could say no\nEven though it's\nRight for ... but it but because it's for one of the beneficiaries the right dose right I just don't I don't like it I don't like how it feels\nI Would think that he could then are you to say wait a minute she NPR both beneficiaries of this divorce poof bucket this credit because so yeah I get that plane yeah but I\nStill think that to just switched to trust the ultimately could say no I don't have to give it to anybody if I don't want\nRent and and it would probably work out but if it were me I cut the making lean I'd cut it off I'd say you know what\nWhatever piece you want her to have give it to her and put the rest in the divorce proof crushed for children grandchildren spouses are out\nOkay good advice there folks Todd has put a lot of good advice in writing for you with his guy designing in income only ... trust he\nHas written this guide for the month of October ... gives you a great foundation of knowledge when you were starting out in the process of having your trust ... ... Luke lose the important information that must be in your trust in sixteen troublesome provisions that absolutely should not be in your trust\nYou can request you're free copy\nOf Todd's designing your ... trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show\nDot com taught our last question comes from Janice in Milton massing Janice writes I Am I on the power of attorney and she is now in a nursing home we are private paying at twelve thousand dollars per month\nShe only has a home and we're in the process of selling it because I can no longer maintain it and I'm not in a position to be able to rent it is there anything that can be done last minute to protect the two hundred and fifty thousand that we will receiving proceeds from the sale of the house [noise]\nYeah that's too bad I'm I'm going to spend just a few minutes on the part that they said they can't do and and really explore that you know I Know clients say they can't rent it or you know they're not in a position I mean to me rent it you're always better off keeping the house\nI think mhm than selling it\nIn a house ... especially a primary residence when you're dealing with last minute planning techniques\nOr a primary residence is non tolerable just because of what it is mhm so I don't have to do anything fancy ... will I get it for a single person like in this case\nThey'll put a lean on it yet but at least for beyond the Medicaid rate versus the private pay rate much slower much lower than private pain we won't be a twelve thousand will be at six thousand ... a month so so keeping it as always in your best interest uh and and even if you don't rent it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Legal Exchange", "city": "Boston", "day": "20"}
