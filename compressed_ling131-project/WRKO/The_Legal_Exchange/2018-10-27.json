I suppose it mail bombs to democratic leaders you know what's coming next you know uh but I you know think of it this way the Kavanaugh hearings I think\nMost people would acknowledge backfired on the Democrats are and it's got to be interesting to see if any more surprises kind of help or hurt their case at the ballot box or in the end\nIf the Republicans can hold both chambers that I don't expect to see impediments to continued good economic activity and associated company performance let me set another way\nI think um if the Republicans are able to hold on it's probably the best case circumstance or for what happens for investors over the next couple of years\nNow we've been talking about earnings quite a bit lately pull out and another good big week for a huge week so overall her company's doing and what were some of the highlights and of course and workable low lights as well\nFor war there are so ... and even those weren't that bad um but you know think about it this way earnings season always kind of goes in these waves a couple of weeks ago the big earnings were the banks right\nThis this past week very big week for technology why is it important because technology's really carried the water to a great degree or in the last year or two more\nThe substantial gains are in the marketplace and so obviously people are very interested in can they continue to show you know really knock\nOut of the park kind of of ah earnings and revenue growth and forward a guidance\nAnd you know up to this point earnings have been pretty good you know to date for two or three earnings\nYou know we're we're looking at about twenty three percent as as the um estimated earnings grows law for cues free after twenty five percent and you want you to I mean those are very big now yeah OK\nAnd twenty three percent of certainly nothing to you know shake a stick at and at the same time revenue growth is up about seven and a half percent versus year growth I get really again another very very good number\nOr an eighty percent of those reporting have beat earnings and that's up more than the typical average of about Seventy seven percent earnings estimates\nBut here's the deal they're beating them by lesser amounts though than there are average beat ... and so\nI Would say it's a it's a good start a really good start earning season but not the best of all time kind of a start suicide and winners this week well certainly one of the biggest winners was ... they were up nine percent and they reported their first quarterly profits since cue for sixteen\nAnd they beat on both earnings and revenues are expectations they also said\nThat they think their production is getting much more efficient\nThey reduce their labor hours to build a model three by thirty percent\nJust in one quarter amazing ah and they're and they're also dealing with many people said they could never do and that was to have a sustained weekly production of five thousand model three's a week so ill on mosques somehow some way of getting it done and that's all stock was up nine percent pay pal Powell was up a lot of nine percent\nThey also beat on earnings and revenues and the peer to peer payment platform you know ... that had an\nEighty percent increase in total payment volumes for the corps incredible right my Microsoft up six percent\nThey beat on both earnings and revenues ... and their cloud revenues for as are up Seventy six percent year over year now that's down from last ah quarters eighty nine percent\nYou're okay we're both but still yeah Seventy six percent it's pretty darn good right Twitter up Seventeen percent and again they beat on earnings in revenue\nAnd what they did was they cleaned up a whole bunch of accounts and they still\nOverall solve their daily active users going up by nine percent the score to that was good news for them Ford was up eight percent on better than expected earnings and more details of their restructuring plan aimed at improving efficiency Comcast up five percent beating earnings and revenues\nThey also had more high speed Internet customers and lower than expected net drop a video customers today at all good news alright and finally visa was up on better than expected earnings and\nEleven percent volume increase in total payments and guess what if you got a strong economy and strong consumer confidence you are going to get people spending on everything from luxury goods to day to day essential prayer\nAnd they feel positive about the futures and they're not afraid to charges that's exactly right and of course we had some ... well not all good news yeah you're right\nAnd and when we say that you know it's funny because they're losers but in some cases they're not let me explain why I'm going to say that Andy was down Fifteen Percent you'd say that was a bad week for a in advance micro devices\nThey make trips we all know about those but the end they beat earnings and they were close on revenue but they're forward guidance showed ... weaker revenue for the rest of the year but keep this Fifteen Percent in in context again the stock has been on a tear it up more than a hundred and twenty percent year to date\nSo it's down a little bit but it's like\nYou know it it did unbelievably fantastic and now they're just taking a little bit off the top okay that's not my idea uh and and if you look at the underlying earnings report it's not a bad earnings report OK okay\nHa anti they were down eight percent they actually didn't have a good quarter and they missed on both earnings even though they beat revenue expectations\nThey they lost subscribers or on direct TV and they also they're direct to consumer streaming offering it didn't have nearly the kind of subscribers that I think they'd hoped for the other two gorillas in the room though were Amazon and Google and a half\nAre tied to answer on the air and hopefully his answer will stop you from being one of his next\nReal life stories top when we talk about funding the trust we talk about actually\nTransferring the ownership and transferring the assets into the name of your ... your great great question which is feels kind of life for a lot of people giving your assets away so if you were to give your assets away whether it's to another person or an eerie vocal trust do you have to pay gift tax when that happens\n... is the first question if you're given outright to the kids is that what you're asking if you give it outright or if I get laid off and I want to know it all so if we give it to the children and we want to compare the two ... giving it to the children will in fact result in a completed gift for gift tax breaks\nAnd so yes you would have to fill out forms seven or ... or ... do the same time your income tax return is do every year or so in April\nAnd the seven o nine would be acknowledging that you made let's say a hundred thousand dollar gift to the kids have a portfolio or five hundred thousand dollar home if you gave away your home\nYou know less the Fifteen thousand dollar president interest exclusion that you're allowed to give away so that's the freebie gas that's the freebie file anything don't even need to file if that's all you were giving away\nBut because this gift exceeded that amount you would file it reduced by the amount of the president interest exclusion the Fifteen thousand dollar freebie\nThe amount over that would be considered\nThe taxable gift and so if it was you know a hundred thousand dollars minus the Fifteen you have an eighty five thousand dollar taxable gift yeah\nDoesn't mean you're going to pay tax because you are going to eat into your eleven million one hundred and eighty thousand dollar once in a lifetime gift tax exemption ... by the eighty five grand\nThat doesn't hurt as much but in Massachusetts and depending on your state even though there is no state a state tax ...\nI'm Sorry no state gift tax yeah you do have to reduce your estate tax exemption\nSo if you only had a million dollar exemption and you ate into it by eighty five thousand dollars well now you are under a million and if you gave away a five hundred thousand dollar home let's make it a real gift you now have five hundred thousand dollars left of your exemption not helpful\nYeah they taxes and a lot of people don't realize when they say oh I don't need the attorney I'm just going to put the house in my kid's name\nThat's a gift that's a gift and we're not even talking about all the other negatives and loss of control and things that go with putting the house in the kid's name but a forgetting that you're right it's a gift\nAnd it's a taxable gift and it really does impact the estate tax calculation going forward right for the person who made the gift not the recipient mhm the recipients folks has no income tax or gift tax liability OK okay ... go\nAhead and how does that I'll defer if you transfer assets into a trust you still need to do that same tax form the form seven and nine and so forth\nYou know and that's the beautiful thing about these irrevocably trust everybody says things are so you know rigid inflexible and scary scary word that every local I've given it away and all this\nI tell people right in the beginning when you set up these irrevocably trust they are in complete gifts for gift tax purposes you are not giving anything to the children who you are not giving anything to the trustee\nYou are simply putting it in the trust the trust what own it\nBut for gift tax purposes it's an incomplete gift because you as the creator of the trust have retained and you've heard of spoke speak about this before\nA limited power of appointment which means you have the right as the donor or to a point the assets to charity mhm\nWell because you could appoint him to charity\nDuring your life we don't really know who the gift would have been made to right that's what makes it an incomplete gift he can change your mind you can change your mind so therefore no seven o nine gift tax return really needs to be filed and there is no gift tax liability\nAnd not only that but there are big benefits to giving your assets to transfer in your ... trust\nVersus just giving away their kids from a capital gains tax cut or active so you you may be unnecessarily creating a tax for your kids were none what exists that's exactly what I just kept it in your trust or even in your own name that you're doing that from a tax perspective\nAnd and also the creditor issue yeah or you don't own it anymore I mean this is a whenever I clients telling me well why don't we just put it in their name I'm like I won't do it yeah you need another lawyer because I'm not going to have my client give up the ownership rights to their home they need to feel comfortable that they can live there the rest of their life they need to feel comfortable they can sell\nAnd downsizing in Yahoo to another state and and not be impacted by adverse gift or capital gains tax consequences we\nDon't like paying taxes let alone unnecessary taxes folks if you hadn't been thinking about creating an ear evoke

advisory group will be back and just a few minutes on the legal exchange with Todd let ski\nTime now for Wall Street we can move you look back at the market performance last week here's Susan Powers and Michael Armstrong make\nThe American jobless rate is at the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine in the unemployment rate is at all time lows do you think the labor market has reached unsustainable levels at this point\nI mean the labor market is just like all other markets you know when employees are readily available employers can pay less for workers and when\nUnemployment is low like today employers are forced to compete for workers often through wage increases when workers become scarce employers have to attract workers with wage increases and benefits and while there is an upper limit to the number of people that can have jobs without ruining it for everyone else there's still significant room for growth\nFor those looking to be fully employed despite this low unemployment rate you know one indicator of this is the inflation adjusted compensation per hour\nWhich has only grown by four percent since two thousand seven you know in addition average hourly earnings and dollars has been very little gross suggesting that inflation is not yet a threat to the labor market\nSo when you say that there's still room to grow for those looking to be fully employed what do you mean by that Mike\nWhat what I mean is that there's a large group of people who are underemployed these are people that have part time jobs but would probably work more if they could find reasonable paying jobs are looking at Americans age thirty five to forty four who are\nYou know a group of workers most likely to be employed you can see that they're still significantly less likely to be employed than they were back in two thousand seven to eight Nineteen nineties or even the late eighties\nSo according to barons about three percent of American part-time want to work fulltime but and that's comparable to the weak job market to the early to thousands which is another sign away remark is actually not over here to\nThings make folks if you have any questions about your portfolio or the economy visit us that Armstrong advisory group dot com\nYou've been listening to Wall Street we can review with Michael Armstrong no back to the legal exchange with Tom blood ski and Susan Powers [laughter]\n...\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us when we're done we'll answer your questions about anything and everything that included in the big blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan ...\n... ton I have a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from Linda in lake worth Florida and Linda writes I Am widowed and have two children my daughter's financially well off but my son is not and he recently moved in with me\nIs there a way that I can make sure that he's able to continue living in my home if I pass away\nWell I think that the question that's missing here Linda is do you also mind if you just inherit your other child ... shouldn't say that in this question I'm going to assume the way she's phrased is that\nShe doesn't want to just inherit her daughter I Would assume so she just wants to make sure that the son\nWho doesn't have a place to live it sounds like the daughter does right or can can live in the house so let's make some assumptions so let's assume we don't want to just inherit anybody 'cause most people don't\nAnd let's expand this a little bit because I see a lot of problems here in addition to this one you talk about our vocal trust Susan it is I think is one of the most important things to mention a and I know we discuss it in the material\nThe ability to change your mind yeah right if this had been given away to the kids\nAnd reserved a life a state and that's all and now later on when she wanted to just take care of the sun not\nNot as guaranteed you can't do it because the daughter has half mhm you even though you have a life of state you've you've lost the ability to rethink how you want that\nRemained her interest to go unless you get kids permission so not as good a ... a way to do with the Iraq a couple trust if it was in there and\nCan you do it I'm going to assume yes we need to trust even if she doesn't have one ... so if we take this house instead of doing a life a state Linda we put it into an era of a couple of trust one just like we're talking about in our materials\nThen what can be done well\nThen once it's in their ... Linda would be able to call let's say I was the draft her she would call me and say you know Todd I we did this trust and you know two thousand six and now my son has fallen on hard times and I need him to have a place to live the rest of my life can we fix\nIt yes we can fix\nIt in the trust that we don't need to talk to the children at all we can simply name uh exercise the power of appointment in the document allowing her to uh just how she leaves the assets to her children\nSo now that we know the flexibility exists to do this in an era of a double trust even for all of you folks who might have done one years ago\nFor Linda it looks like she hasn't done any planning so we will create the trust now and we will put this house in it and we can set it up this way from the get go\nThe language and the trust which say upon my death I Divide and allocate everything equally to the children however with regard to the property located at X Y Z street mhm that needs to be held in\nTrust for the benefit of my son put the name and\nAnd the language in there should go on to say that my son can continue to live there the rest of his life but to put some teeth in it that says provided he pays all of the bills real estate taxes upkeep maintenance et cetera\nWhy because one there may be no money in the trust to do that right and then what the house gets sold or by\nThe real estate tax people put a lean on the house and force the sale you don't know ... right so you need money to maintain it the least he can do is maintain it\nPlus the rest of the assets might have been divided equally to the kids and maybe you wanted them paid out so maybe the daughter got her piece mhm and the son got his peace well then use that money son to pay the bills\nAnd you'd be looking at any or evoke will trust in this case 'cause we want to make sure that houses there for the sun so we've gotta protect\nThat that's exactly right planning that would be done here would be an irrevocably trust so that the nursing home can't take it in case Linda\nFalls into one before she passes remember we still want to protect Linda ... is all about Linda first and then the children but this would give you that ability to do that so and if and if she if he doesn't pay all the bills than the house can be sold\nAnd the money simply amongst the children so we've got to send her to the Donner\nInland and if you are any folks listening are interested in finding out how easy or even a couple of tries to operate on a day to day basis\nGreat place to start is with education and Todd's guide that he's written for the month of October it's designing in ... trust this guy will show you exactly how they operate it will also include information about the drafting of your trust in information that absolutely\nIt's being there in all those problematic clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust you can call right now do it soon because it's your last chance folks because the month is over eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine minutes eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTodd our last question comes from bill in ... burn math in bill writes\nMy wife has MS and has very little assets in her own name years ago when she was first diagnosed I transferred the home\nOut of her name and put it in just mining and my question is about my IRA that's worth around eight hundred thousand should I changed my primary beneficiary to my kids just in case I die before her she would like the likely have to live in a nursing home if I pass away before [laughter]\nThis is a very interesting question and and it reminds me of some other real life stories and\nAnd you know the the idea of planning through short cuts\nIs not always good planning or trying to do it in a you know a quick manner or some kind of a cheaper approach I don't I don't think it always is the best and so when I look at this and I say OK I understand that\nMy my wife has MS we don't know from this what stages she's putting the house and your name now really doesn't do anything you could put the house and your name last minute as she goes in the nursing home putting it in your name now I guess\nOf I'm not even sure why you would do it it doesn't help\nAt all because you can always do it last minute right and again I Would imagine that since she has MS that you guys would at least have powers of attorney in place now so that you could start signing her name and paying bills and transferring real estate in case she does go into a facility\nBut more importantly the fact that you've got and that that that your wife has MS\nShould be saying never mind my house and my other non IRA money\nWhat should I Do was forget the IRA from it all that other stuff\nYou should be doing planning yeah not just sticking a house in your name what about your investment account that you didn't mention in here that might have you know five hundred thousand in it mhm", "show_name": "The Legal Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "27"}
