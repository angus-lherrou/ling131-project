O. D. transfer on death payable on death\nTo her husband Jerry basically a beneficiary attached to her bank account Tribeca go correct is not a brokerage but a bank account then later on she created a revolt couple living trust and then died in twenty Fifteen mhm\nWell Jerry went to claim ownership of the account\n'cause she's listed as the table on death beneficiary you shouldn't have to go to probe it shouldn't have to go anywhere you go get the money that's what that means ... well the bank said no you don't own it\nShe transferred this to the trust mhm and she said that there was certain statements out there that were you know I guess they produced a bank statement or something in some some computer generated records and and they had a copy of the trust\nBut interestingly enough the only thing that they found that was signed was the original signature card and that was signed in\nHer name alone ... so the point of this was the whole decision\nCame down on a a a summary judgment that the bank was gonna say look summary judgment should apply here meaning there is no question of fact just approve this thing right allow me to be right the bank said that's what some re judgment means\nWell this court said the ... the Missouri appellate court reversed the lower court and said you can't grant\nSummer a judgment here not when you have a sign signature card and her name alone even though you might have other bank statements and the like\nThere's a question of fact that needs to be resolved and that's all they said here they didn't say whether it was actually find it or not funded they just said that there is a question of fact it needs to be resolved we need to go to court and pursue these facts\nI Know that when we funded trust Todd so let's see we had an individual transfer on death account and they create one of these trusts\nWhether it's ... ... we open up a whole new account and transfer the assets over there is no linking and just changing the title on it it's an actual Newtown and the name of the trust without a beneficiary\nYeah and that's a good point I think what ... what the argument might be here is that maybe she kept the same account number ... changed the name and now because that's what you did there still may be a beneficiary designation attached to it so even though you change the owner to the trust if you left\nThe beneficiary designation on their friends then maybe it isn't\nIt's going to go according to the beneficiary designation not according to the terms of the trust although the trust doesn't die for their lives in ... well that would trigger that yeah it's interesting so it would probably pass outside the trust outside the will according to the P. O. D.\nAnd I think that was the issue here was yeah it it still have\nIt's the the P. O.

Christian send them back in ah oh three oh four she was protesting the war she was ahead of a protest and manage come like you know any campaign opposition research sort of come out dribs and drabs which he has some good stuff to in terms of from Sally for her to hit her head does send them on she was in charge of a protest it had\nThese fliers it depicted soldiers as skeletons and talked about American terrorists during the Iraq War um\nShe right now with all that with a quote where she sort of blew off some guy who said he on the machine just sort of blew up the idea of some guy was that he wanted to join the Taliban and she said oh yeah you can do whatever you want so and that's become a big part of that campaign my mic Sally who's of a a ten pilots first female I'm a combat pilot in American\nHistory uh she she hit her on it and said you know you've you you are abiding\nBy saying that this kind of radio show said he was going to join the Taliban and she just kind of laughed it off that with all that it's still a tight race in Arizona and I wanted and I mean like we always say like ten years ago that would have ended someone's political career I don't know why you know\nBut the reality is\nIt's Arizona is a border state and I wonder how much would this campaign with all the back and forth and reason I focused on this one race in terms of uh veterans' issues because\nThis could be the difference in the Senate you know just give me the difference in the Senate now you're talking if you add in ... all the other local issues and we talk about is a border state I'm twenty five percent of the population in Arizona is that Hispanics do ... how is this going to God I think none of us know when we won't know until after the ... or after the race over but\nThis can't be when you're running a campaign you can't like this sort of thing because you want variables that you can control and just as one you can't and as you were saying how whether it's going to be um easily managed on the\nBoard or not they won't make it to the border until well after the campaign so I think it may be kind of where it is right now but these are these are big issue and I think I could have it if it ends up being something that it ... or Rosa tied in this and that this could be something that can\n... country look at next door in Texas I mean we have a Ted Cruz in ... or be told or chief is going up or jumps them in our congressmen who Joe Kennedy is going down and I'm\nAssisting oh chief actually a driving them around of several times has gone down near the king I'm paying for um\nCan I say though I just I mean he's been on the show he's a gentleman who I've been very nice to us I'm not sure he's a big vote getter in Texas\nAnd all you well know where I'm raising\nMoney for I'm In Texas is what he's doing\nPerhaps but what's happened is oh chiefs of numbers have gone down the road difference because it was it has been widened the gaps widened and Trump has gone to all the campaigning for Cruz who in the past\nHe couldn't you couldn't tolerate you couldn't stand but you know it's the same politics might be a strange bedfellows as long as they do\nThere they they think it's a given now that the Kavanaugh yeah hearings really brought a lot of Republicans home rice because it's one thing the Republicans can agree on is the court and sort of and in Texas especially\nThat without a doubt um you know there's been a lot of things in the news we've got the air force are spending over a thousand dollars on on coffee cops um December ... takes then he'd better who I don't think so\nI think since the air force who were probably ...\nOh wow well and then when I did do another stories out of you know I'm One of my favorite story had to get someone from the air force on the show yeah [laughter] 'cause we we do too many knocks on the air force so let me ask you about actors like good news for veterans oh no no no no no I mean I think as long as we do that on the show he\nWas a but every time we do it it said there's no one to shoot has hit as lock on the air force that we gotta get someone on the show\nYeah and then John your Marines have been drawn a sky penises over California member of member that maybe it was doing a last year\nWell I like the the um have developed a creative ... to ... to Yuma\nI'm that makes me laugh man I Am I still go with the fact that their ... their fans of Toy Story and that was a top hat days yeah not only have ... says\nThey pay you go but day of it there's a there's there's a couple of pilots and in hot water over there but I Do want to talk about a real story the story I can talk a little bit uh in depth about 'em in Afghanistan and Kandahar a we had um an army general uh Austin Scott in Eller um was shot a\nIn a a a green on blue attack or an insider attack on Afghanistan\nOr which um you know also killed at the top a police officer and in Kandahar I'm\nJoel Rose IQ or that someone actually I met when I was in my uh\nMy deployment to Afghanistan and guy was a pretty brutal guy but he's certainly got a lot of respect and was able to to ah give it a lot of Taliban down there he was killed so evidently they wanted the Taliban wanted to kill the American which I'm surprised about because when I was there they were more interested in killing local officials\n'em by has a very successful attack\nA that's for sure um you know and it I don't think it's something that's been getting a lot of a play here in America you know I kind of general wounded in battle what went on an insider attack I mean in a in a nation that we're trying to build and we've been trying to build for over twenty almost Twenty years\nThat's a lot of good side\nWhen I was a a new one neighborhood in Kabul when I was in Afghanistan I was not there but with him but I sort of imply that the general green hair of major general how green was was the highest ranking he was right\nYou've asked a in a ... point along with the NATO alliance is\nRight in and he was the highest ranking I think since Vietnam right who was killed and it but does inside of threats are real\nThat's a that was that was happening all the time when I was there um you know wasn't very hard for the Taliban to get to get uniforms or what they were able to do is you know maybe they knew there was an Afghan police officer in the area so they'd kidnapped their family or something and and you know blackmail the that officer into doing something\nIn recently there was I said recently might have in the summer there was another attack on in ...\nRight which is a rather places supposed you know you cannot save a baton supposed to be on a ...\nYeah and I think a lot of that comes from and people who\nDon't know\nI Would say that it is the way you want to explain it to people is that the person who's doing it half the time most of the time already knows they're dead right whether or not their family is going to be a lot I mean ... this is that that's how brutal life it is over there so that they were going to do the story kind of came out this one in in dribs and drabs okay\nDid you know first they were saying that the um the general wasn't wasn't wounded dentist story came out that he drew his weapon and that he was very close to it and then now it's come out that he that he was wounded\nAnd I mean it it it it really is crazy I I I think uh but he he was close with the the Afghan\nGeneral issue or the Afghan or was he was he still um that the person who was killed the asking the Afghan official Zeke so he's known him for years and actually he came out and said and it was like sort of a a a personal loss for him to not just for this for the uh service\nYeah they got the top intelligence officer um in Kandahar a and they the the governor was also there who I also had met when I was in Afghanistan um you know the ... the tell a lot of high value target\nThe Taliban these days I be incapable of a mounting any a serious military of threats and you know reduced to doing terrorist activities this out is I think it depends on the region\nFriends on yeah it depends on a region they still have a shadow government operating a lot of places I'm sure it's still operating in Kandahar data that a lot of power that I mean that's where they were really that's where they were ... with the ethnic pass Jones um which are commonly found in the southeast I'm so they've had a lot of strength there um\nYou know and\nIt's quite honestly Pakistan still backing them up I'm sure there are backing them up when I was there because Pakistan doesn't want a very strong Afghanistan right to you know neighboring it\nCould\nMean or what is it moved just a couple of weeks ago when we were reading and talking about how are you ... ... was basically out of business these days\nMore and throughout owning property deal out of business by a long ago was changed names but yeah I mean and they and they actually a good thing about what's going on ISIS is they don't have the ability to generate an income from the ... I mean that's so there are\nNo money no land I mean they're they're dead in ... in terms of actual power but you know what's what we talked about on the show they'll just morphs into some other name and you know five years or wherever we leave and don't pay attention to\nIn longer term they have credibility in certain areas in the jihadi circles I mean they at least temporarily reestablish the caliphate right I mean that's what's so it's not so much I mean it's evil but I'm just saying in terms of like I don't think they've gone away like you said even if they changed their name and there's an offshoot to it\nWhenever we call it it's going to be around for probably sadly enough our kids are going to know about it\nAnd just coffee um I barely worked out rapists yes repeats and uh and and my diet was was ... or something [laughter]\nYeah you can ... the dollars that you can buy the hall versions of the dollars over there for those who don't like these little energy drinks you got to its monster ties like ten yeah and you live on that on deployment\nAnd and I basically lived on that and even coming back and twenty ten I found that a year or two three four years after coming back I mean I was still\nOn that diet I'm not working out or you know just calling myself fat and lazy fast forward twenty fourteen I was you know one of the recruits a statement ah instructors Qadri member I'm so training the soldiers getting them ready for boot camp and\nI found that this is twenty fourteen that there's a huge emphasis on fitness uh but nobody's talking to the soldiers about their life after basic training and once they get to the unit and start that one weekend a month um and even nowadays there's a huge problem uh of um the prevalence of\nObesity and and the service members that can pass height and weight or can't even pass the physical fitness test and uh they just get the pink slip to get booted or adverse evaluations and a\nTwenty fourteen I you know I was a year into my graduate program so I decided to ah create a couple of programs that I started doing their uh during the recruit training so I Would talk to them about their wellness about nutrition\nAnd a couple of years later ah that program I developed another program that the yellow ribbon started using so\nThey need was to create a health and nutrition program for the military and it kind of sounds unpopular a but what I found that and still to present day there's a huge emphasis on fitness or a you know an abundance of resources are for fitness and then a huge clip dive\nAnd then we go into mental health interventions behavioral health so nobody's really talking about the daily you know how the nutritional habits a man and I think there's a huge need for that and that's what I'd been advocating championing for for the past several years\nWell I'm ... cooking [laughter]\nNo don't worry I'm I'm not I'm not that kind of nutrition guy so\nUm but so prominent platoon or started off as a nutrition education resource for service members are back in twenty fourteen but it involved into a education and training service so now\nWe're providing a health nutrition and wellbeing training to a military groups that are in groups nonprofits and corporate groups so anything and everything from a performance and productivity to nutrition education programs that seem to be the uh the missing component and many health programs\nOr something like ... certainly talk about on the show a lot you know ... on his side do CrossFit paleo\nBut we've talked about stories where um you know it's a national defense risk that we have an entire country that they may have a hard time recruiting people uh you know this goes beyond a health and fitness all supposed to education and and criminal backgrounds but it's becoming harder and harder for recruiters to even find people to get in the military\nSo my guess is that they're probably recording people that are barely qualified especially on the outside and you know and\nIt's easy to lose weight when uh they control your sleep and you're eating and your exercise and you have to do it a couple of times a day\nYou know when you don't really want to know like you said then you get out either and in the guard reserve or even active duty ... and then once you get out of the military entirely you don't have that that\nLet's call it motivation\nYeah yeah I mean absolutely it's a I mean this was several years ago where I was an ambassador for the Institute for responsible nutrition but one of the individuals that was there to he was another ambassador that was in the military but he wrote a thirty page dissertation ... it was longer than thirty pages are but\nUh it is a textbook definition of a homeland security issue it is when there aren't enough ah\nCitizens to you know to be ready for the for the armed services are who can't pass a physical at maps um and then the other thing that I'm once they are in\nAnd you know once they are in boot camp is one thing they receive all the fitness training there\nSo they already know how to be fit you know and that's been my my mission for the very beginning it's a just addressing that knowledge action gap because my audience you know the military and the police force it's it's a population that are already knows how to be fit they they already know but many things got into way so\nMost of us you know we use that label fat and lazy you know I called myself at least several years ago um but families is just an output and nobody's really asking the questions so what's the input you know there's things like a you know psycho social barriers um you know cognitive stuff\nFinancial stress worry anxiety so all these things that nobody's really asking you know the easy label is fat and lazy but\nThey're you know as far as adult learning and that was my my my major in graduate school adult learning how adults fine and how they develop\nTheir several factors affecting somebody's health and and they're you know and their fitness and um my programs basically address those things and you know we identify barriers than we talk about strategies\nNo no I'm I'm going to um go along with the ... when you served with who when you go in the military and they control everything in the ... sweep the amount of virtual SARS Nineteen sixty years are joined the marine corps with my brother\nAnd when I went in there were two hundred and forty five pounds but I was a football player was wiring him and I was used to lift them very heavy weights\nBut all I Want to do was one ton at the most movies fifty yards and then are cute dumb that would have if you don't know\nUm my brother he was a basketball player and he worried about two one ... one in mind would run back in ... he was little but Paul wouldn't be run back and forth all big one\nAnd the boot camp I worry about ... married he ... he ... to ... see was to wander ... yeah and I could run for ever could do pull ups climbed most ropes do everything the Marines remarried wrote to 'em than go when you up but it was a whole different form of training and uh\nAnd I remember just before the day before we graduated\n... to ... you know who would be worth a ... foot two hours for most of the goals but most of America and he said you a mother is ... ... ... ... ugly for putting them do all with\nRegard to how can a buddy of mine and ... what's being ugly has to deal with it [laughter] there you go to the general\nBoth know was really you know we had no one outside from helping us we had no prob rooms and the one boosting of nutrition or anything yet and ... and ... and what are you doing today is ... ... you are going\nTo be absolutely and and that's still an institutional training gap where there's fitness training um and then a cliff dies and then you know next thing you talk about is all those mandatory suicide awareness ... sexual harassment but nobody's really talking about\nYou know and today we'll go to a ... there's so much in the fast food\nIn ... when I was growing up we stayed at home you know good food being put in your system and it was a lot of it but we used that was good\nHave you visited uh any military bases lately law or warts uh yeah yeah it's ... baby yes on Burger King and Charlie's Yellen's big one and the thing is like you know like I I Love pizza you know I'm not saying that fast food is the devil but when that's like the only option\nAnd I mean we're not in the basic training and basic training environment anymore where you're preaching everyday I mean if you're not an elite training unit\nThen you're basically working the typical nine to five job at a desk with all the stress worries and and all that other stuff that you know normal civilians go through and if you're not teaching three four times a week well then ah yeah it's very easy to gain all that way\nYeah well I go to the next step too and I certainly felt this myself as you get these habits when you're in your lower ... you know you're young twenties which work you can manage fine\nThen you start then you turn thirty or you get older white ... a ... well yeah and then but those those those PTA habits you had don't quite work as well as they used to\nKnow and I think a lot of it as a childhood obesity is a big big deal now um you know temple mothers of American as you know it's a joke but um I you know we've talked about it I lost about a hundred pounds and I went into my doctor\nTalked about how his ... when I was at a breaking service and decided to get fat so when I got back I lost some weight came back in\nWith the doctor told me I went to the doctor and I said jeeze you know I feel like I can put on weight like nothing and he said yeah stupid you used to be fat and now you're going to gain weight fast and that's why for children when they gain weight is and and this is a very layman's understanding is\nThat there really aren't people if you were heavy at one point you have to be very vigilant because\nYou can look at it the the you know they would say the person who can look at a cake and gain weight because the fat cell is always there it's just doesn't have the fat and that has got to go in and putting it in in that when you set a child up for failure you know you let's face it a lot of knows enough a lot of kids who\nHave gland problems and different things but a lot of it is just people being overfed yeah and I don't mean to be mean but it's usually not as much overfed it's not as much activity for a young kid a kid to burn off stuffed in night right and I think it just eating habits like you said teaching them how to eat somewhat health you know younger", "show_name": "Soundoff: The Veteran's Show", "year": "2018",
