I mean even if it's a hundred thousand I well I mean he could have lived there could have been twenty four seven twenty four seven chair and it's and it's a hundred and fifty thousand a year you're I guess you're getting there\nI Would think you'd have much of a case if you're not gonna complain about not getting paid for a seven or eight years I Know I kind of a accepting here fate here\nAgain that isn't really the point of view point of this stuff goes on every day and I think this was obviously a stranger not a real not a family member yeah I didn't care\nBut I think we need to spend some time on certainly if it's a stranger I just say family members step up look out see you know see who this person is that it's caring for your loved one and make sure you've got your hands on the ... yeah uh but what about\nAll the family members that are providing care for other family members that are moving and I think we need to add that fact pattern yeah to this case and explore\nThat a little bit and I think you share with us last week Todd that there are more than thirty five million\nUnpaid family caregivers so you need to loosen up for this folks because this is great advice Todd's gonna give you he's also giving you some great advice and writing with his guide that he's written for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust\nThere's so much that you're supposed to know about what should and should not be in your ear evoke about trust so that it works it's all about the drafting folks but how are you supposed to know what should or shouldn't be in there you don't\nFortunately for you Todd who is our elder law expert\nHe's written this guy that will give you everything you need to know including what must be in their sixteen different problematic provisions that should not be in there\nAnd he's also included a question and answer pretty comprehensive section on how these trust work every day you can request you're free copy and Todd's designing in income only irrevocably trust guide right now by calling eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com and you can download your guide you can download our podcast and you can make your questions for Todd the answer on the air\nSo how does it work if you're you know a loved one providing care I think you have a lot more to worry about ah in this case a oftentimes you're not worried so much about the stealing or they're not getting paid in fact lots of times you don't even want to get paid right um but the parent wants to pay yeah a\nLot of times they do because you might be reducing your hours at work you're all circling the wagons you're all pitching in what you might even give up your job right here for our parents full time\nAnd you need you need a financial flow of money yeah so so if you're going to do that folks than while we're not worried so much about the elder abuse part of this case or the criminal aspects of this case\nWe're worried about future medicate application you know things that you do well you're living ... out of normal acts of kindness goodwill actions that you take your don't always realize the impact that might have on a future medicate application\nSo if you're a parent that you're caring for ends up going into a nursing\nHome right 'cause they're adults to cry and you can't uh you get to a point where it's beyond your capacity yet acute medical care or effective so so what do we do in the interim what we want to get paid if you want to get paid you must have a personal care contract\nEspecially if you're a ... a family member doing them like you need the personal care contract and you need in the personal care contract to itemize out the kinds of services you think you're going to be providing\nFrom running errands to doing medical prescriptions to doctor visits to uh things around the house and the type of care you're actually going to provide for the loved one whether it's toiling transferring bathing medicating okay put all that and\nAlso you need a paragraph in there about the hours you think you're going to be spending ... and how you're going to get paid whether it's twice a month whether it's every week and the hourly rate what's a good rate do you think taught as a guide lies you know I've seen enough fair hearing decisions come down on this that that hourly rate\nFor a non a nurse practitioner right here just a family member you know stick around twenty dollars an hour okay I think you'll be okay but even at twenty bucks an hour if you've moved and you can justify a lot of time\nEspecially if you don't have another job and so you could be moving you know five thousand a month out ... easy um and if you're doing that you need to then not only have the personal care contract with all of that information in it\nYou need to then make sure that you take the money and\nDeposited in your account\nAnd reported on your personal income tax return okay so it goes through that process as ordinary income that those two steps to contract and the reporting it on the income tax return converts this from a non from a loving arrangement where you're not expecting to get paid ... an actual\nYou know I expect to get paid proposition yeah\nAnd you might even have the parent issue a ten Ninety nine ... at the end I read it as a gift right we want to make sure so there's no gifts so that if she does get sick and goes in the nursing home later\nThe transfers are not considered disqualifying transfers there is no five year penalty period you've cleanse that and you get to keep what you weren't in the end you're faced with just a last minute planning for for the loved one at that point\nYou know folks you need to have a solid plan in place Todd's guide\nThat have written for the month of October it's designing any income only ... trust it will show you how these trust are working and it's all in the drafting\nThis guy shows use six different um ... must be included in your trust in sixteen different troublesome\nProvisions that you want to make sure I'm

I think technically I think just technically be but I don't think it's I I Would never say I was Native American with that type of a of a background would you know no\nI mean I mean who who are who I was going to say when their right mind would say that but what she's trying to say is all I had a freedom we ...\nA background that when you said some when you had a cook book or whatever and so the high cheekbones remember that are that are in Seoul to substantiate is\nUm to to move some DNA tests but the DNA test those are really prove anything it's you know most Americans could come up with that you know so I'm just saying that\nShe's coming up with a Native American dream which she's going to be able to say yes I have a Native American dream but from\nMy point of view those that may ... a Native American I'm going to say no but she's going to say well technically are ... and the argument will go on a tomato Simon\nTurkey nations says the ... that DNA tests is useless that a turning a travel citizenship or they said it was inappropriate wrong\nYou know go now to Native Americans or\nDo you know the the um chief of the Cherokee tribe at one point was that would send them would go over you know well that was right after the American revolution in um there was a ... who married the daughter of the tribe\nAnd um had a son ... son off to a ... and um do with the\nThe the sun claim a Native American what happened\nWas the son who is now the grandson of the chief of the Cherokee tribe\nI'm the father fought for the British during the war\nAnd when they watch the tour you when you watched he decided to move back to Scott won but he decided not to bring his show or the wife and son with him\nHe abandoned them they returned to try and the sun grand ... the chief eventually became the chief of the tribe end\nWound up leaving them in battle against the um the U.S defeat at the U.S in a number of battles and eventually piece was ...\nThe charities wound up going out to Oklahoma that's true too yeah not all but does that make me a Native American oh even though we have the ... T try I mean you know where you relate to them\nYeah I mean that that's the thing about you know we have my family has done or the ancestry dot com sort of stuff and you know we've got ties to the civil war bunker hill which is pretty cool but yeah yeah ... years so far removed from it\nYou know we got connections that the people I found in Cleveland, Ohio evidently but saying you know you don't have every new these things are even heard these stories\nAnd that's you know and and we're talking to six that ten generations back\nYou know you know challenge over the middle of on a ... ah we're sitting at a conference and\nBefore we start going over arrive family background we discovered where I forget what the fourth or fifth cousins but I mean where were you worried it but I Would never claim him as a cousin because he was so far removed you know I'm so for me to say\nI'm a Native American and I because I have a little speck of\nA teeny little Jean and yeah I I wouldn't do that but that's me you know she's seen seems to think well hey I'm Native American but no tried to the subway gonna would middle now\nNow if you imagine you know a military aspect of how many people can say is there a gold star family member now Joe six generations on someone got was a ... yeah you know what I mean it's yeah it's a it's a slippery slope for sure All right John another thing that happened this week is I'm\nSenator Jack Reed he's a Democrat from Rhode Island I sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and he's been pretty critical of President Trump has a claim that President Trump hasn't visited the troops overseas in a combat zone and uh I guess that's true um you know I certainly can't think of a time when when he's done it and don't want to get your thoughts on on what you think about that\nYeah well um I did read about that and I bought a little bit about it and\nYou know although it would be nice for the president to visit the troops I think it's more important but he supports the troops and that I think Trump is a pretty good at a helping fund the military jumped him ah\nEquipment that they need to put her in a you know John rules and we lose that are conducting the Warren worried that should've been conducted before a and he's gone around to a lot of polls here\nWhere we just visited troops when they've come back in the East Village with the troops a prior to them deploying\n... and also it's been a very contentious period of time for him as president so we had a lot of other issues to deal with so although I Would have white tulips seeing them\nGo over and visit the troops I'm not that upset that he has some I'm sure at some point she will\nYeah and I mean from a military perspective\nA hated when generals visitor us in Afghanistan\nYou know ... you basically get away from the mission you start clean and things that shouldn't that don't even need to be cleaned up I'm just so that you know they can get the photo op to come out never mind the security elements that are that we ... we had John I'm ... I'm came in and checked out a bizarre that we're building in Afghanistan Kandahar that site\nThem the weeks and weeks a planning to have him come through for half an hour and we had to have um a whole company of infantry men that were on the outer court on and you know he had his own security if people just uh the the dog and pony show was ridiculous and never mind the fact that\nYou know ... you're risking a serious serious um security breach now you know when something bad really really bad could happen you know you have all the the Afghan national police and and after Afghan Army that's you know that it's been compromised\nYeah you could you imagine if you want you know and and and got hurt or killed or from a Democrat I'm forever we'd open notes exactly me out a letter I don't you know that's how the problem is that when people you know that that's not how we should be thinking about the commander in chief now and um you know and it's OK yeah obviously he's not going to go into Syria or you know\nA racket the Green Zone you could probably do well without a ton of concerns\nBut other than that you he's going to Germany or or Kuwait which isn't a combat zone technically right but I mean does it help around [noise] you know you could see can say a lot of things from from what I'm here to have to build morale\nI think what else morale was the ... dropped the mother of all blondes right let's do migrate oh I think that helps morale and I think when he says hey I'm putting a boost general about general women turned them loose hey I think that helps\nMorale gotten Mattis are being secretary of the fence was as a as a pretty big morale boost start off\nUm but yeah I I don't know every night there Dr seuss is on a basis is done yeah I mean and there and this variation of\nA terrorist group an obviously they've gotten more and changed their name to something else and right whatever but when you see that happening I think that helps ... yeah ... I think when you see bad stuff happening\nThat's what helps morale not who the president coming over and ... when I\nDid I say I spend all this time cleaning day cleaning rocks you know you're you're an average Joe you're you're cleaning rocks so us cleaning concrete T walls and ... and things like that it's ... it's the opposite of morale belt I don't know\nHow many people were smoking but you make sure no cigarette\nOh yeah yeah and uniforms gotta be squared away at all that sort of stuff that you know you're in a combat zone it's very hard to keep your uniform super clean\nYep yeah I don't\nI have a feeling the average Joe isn't isn't too upset so I just say hey you know\nLike January Jack Reed is uh is he is a veteran so yeah you know there is that you go to these guys you know not just what he's also a Democrat and he's worked in their words to mark the ... of course but you know I haven't been on a roll was Stacy ... home runs\nAnd there's a lot of like um all of the Boston teams\nLook at that China you know what a Segway yeah exactly and it was optics looked pretty good then the very open and ah even taking care of business with Philadelphia the sun ...\nRed Sox doing or what they show them when I'm going to have to I'm going to have to waved a white flag here and they've done they've they've done more than I ever anticipated and\nThe patriots fine we spent a come around ... order is restored job in the wrong so you know ... they were up there in them and give them some time\nWe're joined today in Studio by Jackie holiday uh she's from the Bedford vi should have a community outreach over there and so she's trying to enroll veterans in the VA healthcare system and does a lot of other things she was a lot of hats so Jackie welcome to the show thank you it's a pleasure to be here\nAbsolutely could tell us a little bit about the Bedford vi and and what you do with them\nOkay so the ... da is health care system in and of itself relocated a little north of the city of Boston and we are basically an out patient a healthcare facility with inpatient mental health and long term care\nAnd we do a lot of mental health a research as well as treatment there so we are trying to\nCoincide with the the secretaries agenda of\nUm crisis prevention is one of our main goal is right now so a veterans crisis line is always open twenty four seven so I Want to kind of talk about that a little bit veterans or veterans family members who are in crisis or perceived to be in crisis\nCan call the hotline and at one eight hundred two seven three eight to five five and press one for veterans\nOr they can text eight three eight to five five or now there's also a lot chat a option for veterans of family members who are perceived to be in crisis and by visiting\nWWW dot Bedford da di ... you'll get all of this information and all the ways to contact our veterans crisis line\nI'll tell you I'm a patient at the Bedford ... I've been patient there for about seven years and they've always been great to me a lot of different appointments there and you know easy to get to um surprisingly you know I don't think never really been to Bedford before in my life other than going to last ... small sleepy town Lexington Concord area and um\nYou know springs road is where it's located and it's kind of a\nYou know it's kind of a quiet little road you know it's like a residential area so and then there's this big sprawling VA campus so it's it's it's it's definitely a good thing it's a ton of parking which is what I really enjoy about it and you have a golf course there is a golf course yeah it's raining Hanscom oh you know it's a kind of give people an idea where it is and I know it's\nA great story or do you think there is also the of the um if north um regimes hospital were ... and you know you really know that also for 'em to for the uh ... over ...\nYes Bedford has the largest long term care facility within to be a system already so we're quite proud of that you're\nSo some ... getting up in the ... year you're becomes more and more important to me I [laughter] that's\nTrue and we also have a community based outpatient clinic have climates in Gloster Lenin have are all in the communities that I'm I'm veterans live in so the veterans can receive treatment in their facilities\nAnd along those lines are we do have a new program where we are providing eligibility support in those clinics ... re occurring basis so that veterans living and in and around those communities can find out about their benefits the benefits at those clinics on a regular basis\nYeah that's great and I'm now you guys are hosting a couple of events on the bed for vi campus right that I don't even want to talk about it it's a good opportunity for veterans and their family members to to go and learn about a lot of the different services that are available\n[noise] yes I'm On October twenty eight which is a Sunday were hosting the ASA five K. run walk along with the whole health fair bet the VA has a focus now on integrating\nPhysical and clinical treatment so we're host or hold healthier will feature a flu shots but eligible veterans yoga\nA cooking demos tai chi and a few other things that are now available to our veterans as alternative treatments I'm so that we're now approaching the whole health of the veteran not just their\nTheir physical health but their mental and emotional health as well this is a free the whole health fair is free and again it's open to the general public however the flu shots will only be for eligible eligible veterans and if you're a veteran out there and you're not sure about whether or not you're eligible for vi benefits\nWe will have staff on site that will be able to register you I'm In providing the information and hopefully we'll have someone from the BPA there as well to do some claims and take\nAnd again that's on Sunday October twenty eight the race starts at nine o'clock the race and the whole health there from nine to one\nSame day registration for the race starts at seven thirty and by the way veterans run free so veterans that present a proof of ID either duty to fourteen or veterans Audi car will be able to run the five K. at no cost\nAnd the first one hundred veterans with proof of id will also receive a long sleeved T shirt or we proudly served T shirt for the day\nThere you go are done at the race before and it's there's a lot of health shot off to tell you [laughter] you know it's it's a beautiful beautiful course and uh you know it starts ends right at the VA hospital and you saw a gun is plenty of parking there so it makes it a lot easier now you get the whole health further to yet so\nAnd then I talked about flu shots and I think we talked about on the show before but um you can get a veterans can get their flu shot at Walgreens now too so that's something I did this year for the first time and\nUm there was a it was pretty easy we just have to have EA healthcare id and um yeah your show it to them and it took like ten minutes and you just feel a little forming a little you know signed and\nThat's that so that was nice and easy but you can go to this race and the whole health fair and go down right track\nYou share can you get your flu shot practice some yogurt tai chi ... if you're a runner participate in the run but if you're not you can cheer on the the folks who are so we're looking forward to being a great family event on that day\nWas going to hope for a good weather right [laughter] [noise] yeah well what's how it is an outdoor event pleased dress appropriately\nThey have a couple of times it's been a little cold but a good running weather though some of my favorite time to run 'em\nSo you talked about yoga touchy ... V. aids moving into some of the other sort of\nUm you know alternative or eastern health and wellness gets a little about that I mean I Know I'm I was able to use carrying a community through vi and to get acupuncture and I'm so that was a been a pretty it's the first time I've ever used that the choice program a caring community program and it's been pretty easy\nYeah we're proud that um the VA is leading the nation in the attack on the opioid crisis so we're able to us\nFor veterans a lot of alternative treatments I'm as opposed to to prescribe drugs so yoga meditation tai chi acupuncture these all things that are um\nHelping to develop the veteran as a whole not just again his physical health or their physical health but their mental and emotional health as well\nSo uh the vet for VA does have these yoga tai chi that are available in sessions on the campus on a weekly basis and again by visiting a website W. W. W. dot ... da di da ... and get the schedule classes so we're pretty proud of that\nYeah there's I mean the thing about the VA to it's like there's a Big Jim there you know no one ever you know thinks about a hospital what it what a gym and that's where a lot of the physical therapy happens so I don't want to talk about some of the other things that you know that are at the VA hospital I'm into a pool of this is how one of the tunnels uh it's over a mile right\nI think it's like one point eight miles so yeah we do have an indoor pool as ... as well as the gym facility that's open for veterans use 'em if you're if you're eligible veteran\nUm for care the only thing required is to have a physical claimants through your provider that says that you're physically able to use these facilities and yes Kyle the gym and a pool also use the physical therapy for recreational purposes as well\nYou know I'll tell you I went up in um\n... uh to bed for for the installation ceremony for the new director and it was a great day but you had a actually a small parade all round the whole facility and then they had a call on food ... it was just a great day you know\nI didn't show the whole facility\nThat is a lovely campus is a beautiful place to to work or visit and yes we do have a new hospital directed Dr junk Clifford she's been ... for a few months now and hopefully she'll be a guest on this show sometime in the near future so she can kind of um a share her ideas about the way forward the effort\nAnd another thing um public transportation or will take you to uh to bed for a new can\nIt can be a challenge but it can have challenged but you can get a candle happened\nYes ah as count mentioned we're tucked away in a nice little neighborhood so but the public ... BPA busted does run their cell bus sixty to make up around the day so they're getting their by public transportation is an option\nFor veterans who live on the north shore and in the mirror ... valley uh we do provide transportation from our clinics so and\nVeterans are receiving their primary care treatment in one of our community based clinics but need to come to ... especially care there are shuttles that leave those clinics daily to transport the veterans to the hospital and for the apartments and then back to their communities", "show_name": "Soundoff: The Veteran's Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "20"}
