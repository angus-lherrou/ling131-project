the trust therefore all the assets and the trust her accountable\nSeems logical [noise] no no no it does not does not [laughter] and and interestingly enough one of these decisions said yeah yeah we like that\nAnd in fact we're going to deny the Medicaid application on the ground and say that you are now denied Medicaid the assets of the trust accountable\nGo away [noise] so we're going to have to do something about that but nevertheless again not my case but one that that came about mhm\nFive days later another fair hearing officer exactly the opposite result and as you might imagine I think it's the other a fair hearing officer being correct and I'm going to explain that to you and why the difference in a minute\nAnd you know what folks you need to make sure that your trust is

exchange show dot com download your guy download our podcast and submit your questions\nFor Todd [noise] so why is the difference again I'm going to try and keep it as non technical as I can well a couple of things one\nArgument really is\nUnderstanding the definition of a limited power of appointment mhm K which is what this is you are limited don't or to the ability to a point to a charity but the definition itself\nIs that a power of appointment is not a property interest so you don't own any thing\nNumber one and the definition says that you cannot exercise the power\nIn any way in which you would benefit directly from the exercise of the power mhm so even if they were to say you're going to put it on some kind of a condition we're going to condition this distribution to the charity only if the charity uses it to pay for my care\nWell then you could not exercise that power to that charity right because it would benefit you win that would be a violation of the definition itself\nWhich is technically fraudulent right and in violation of your own power you breach in your own duty I thought\nThere was a big case that came down with this earlier this year and that kind of put this issue to\nWasn't there something that well there was a Supreme Court case that addressed it as a possibility to look at applying the any circumstances test it didn't rule on it that was had said maybe mass health should consider this as an option\nDidn't rule on it just seems to me these they're hearing officers operating a cone of silence that themselves they're twisting around things right and you know there's more that can be done here right so in this case\nYou also have the very definition the essence the Internal Revenue code that says what is it\nA five oh one C. three charity these are how you get the dust sharing on your income tax return if you give it to a charity well when you read the definition of charity under five oh one C. three which is an Internal Revenue code section it says\nThat you are absolutely not allowed to give to a charity\nIf you do give to a charity the essence of a charity means that the charity is prohibited from using that money to benefit the giver mhm or if it's a nursing home and you have private stock in the nursing home you can't benefit a private stock holder\nSays that right in the Internal Revenue code\nWell then you see there is really no direct path when you give it to a charity who's a nursing home to know whether or not they will use it for your care or even if they're permitted to use it for your care so how can you say it's a way in which you are accessing the principal\nGrasping at straws you you can't write ... you can't do that so and of course by do share duties do apply so even if the trustee is the one that has to issue the check if you tell the ... the don't or tells the trust issue to issue the check\nTo the charity knowing that there's been a condition applied to it that it's got to be used for your care one I don't think the nursing home can accept it and to\nThe trustee was purchased by do share duty if it then did that mhm distribution remember a gift to a charity that benefits you is not a gift to a charity it's a gift to yourself right and the other fair hearing officer said we agree not accountable\nFolks if you have a trust now or you're thinking about getting a trust call for

her I'm sure he's against war I mean I mean it's probably on the liberal side of things but he I don't think he's necessarily\nThere's about anti war but this is just people who don't get it this I think is more of a symptom than the problem this is a symptom of ... of multiple generations having so few people serve they don't understand the word they don't even understand what it means when they see veterans all they see the guy getting ten percent off his coffee they don't see what it\nMeans and yeah and I think they see the the the free education you get from the GI Bill the free health getting it from be a health care you know the the license plates you can get from the state welcome home bonuses the job training the all the career centers all sort of stuff and ... ... one of those guys get a what can I\nCan write and using go in my in my in my youth I was testifying in at the statehouse and someone asked it was about ... uh paying for college and someone one of the senators said to me something about what was on where you you didn't have to pay for college and I politely reminded of no I paid upfront\nIn Iceland and that's what these people who think that you can expand the definition you can just change the word to mean whatever means so Boy Scouts in our veterans I mean this is foolish and it's offensive but it's like you said he he lays it out well I ... I\nMean it's the talk of and pulled Vietnam or or is he talking about ... ...\nOr you know full of votes he makes no difference\nIt makes no sanction Ron\nHe's he wants it all yeah and ... and ... and then I you you watch TV and you see people talking about this because the talking heads get going about it I guess we're talking heads to\n[laughter] but there are people who say well you know maybe the Peace Corps and now the ... the discussion is whether or not it should be given to someone else we're having a discussion about who we should give it to\n... and I just think we as veterans need to stand up and say no it isn't about the ten percent discount it's about the word well\nI was ... opening segment John I really like to do it do you have an opening for us\nNo I'm I'm Still I'm stuck on this one was on the road out here for five oh well it was ... before the show huh [laughter]\nRegard was so I think ... or something the market was a you know for storm here and uh I I'm pretty effects on it too drunk to be honest I think we all and I think that you can talk to a sort of fix on it I mean one of those listening they'll go show who's got a brief him those guys out of his mind\nWell yeah I Know I don't want to sit here and give you all the cliches but you know we've all done it all the holidays you miss you know because you're in the service\nOr a matter of fact that you know your government property and they can send you wherever they want and the the uncertainty that you had you know we have people ... the smallest ... a lot of people have is just just four years of their life you know just four years of their prime now mind people give twenty Thirty years\nYou know never mind the people that you actually saw combat no amount of people actually got hurt and combat you know wounded in combat and and that's what these people want and you look at a lot of the the the ... you know obviously there are plenty of benefits that that are for any veteran but a lot of this is Taylor to people who were wounded or who have service connected injuries\nWell one of these social justice warriors entered from well no doubt that was the split up from the sign it they were holding\nTheir paper cuts do not mock those paper cuts out but you know and and they think they're doing something important maybe they are obviously protesting is important part of our our nation's history and you know and we had a good time throwing ... and the ocean you know that ... that's about all your all that's all right well but but you go protest on a Saturday afternoon and then you've got to go home\nYou know and you got to see your family as opposed to someone in stuck in Afghanistan or you know you're not seeing anyone\nHe references Tom Thomas Jefferson in here the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams would be embarrassed\nIf you if they if if anyone tried to compare their what they do have to\nYeah and none of those protesters or you know no no you know I I I'm sure he sees no difference between having them when when they sign when when all those guys signed a declaration of independence\nAnd we're obviously involved with a revolution\nIf we if we had last that was not a day they were only get killed in ... and ... what do you see that I think there is a point to like this is part of the when people talk about if we've all had as veterans we've all had people come up to us or at least to hurt people talk about things like civil service say well you know don't get me wrong and then the real point comes out\nYou know that you should get everything and then the the point is everything but what I Want\nSo you know you grow up and you want your little your kid to get on the police force and now he he has a hard time getting on because there's an awful lot of veterans in the way now of a sudden well you know do we really need civil service to be all for veterans is making up for what you just turned it on ... face that people made in time for your home and be able to get\nMy God what a jump resonate limited what we've been talking about physical danger in physical um we're a veteran a real veteran those support him or herself in harm's way well also they've given up their freedoms they they don't have the right to go out and protest\nI remember my drawing struck the telling me we're not here to practice freedom where's your to preserve it so you give up a lot of your freedoms you can like go and do certain things\nAnd so it was a result of this for a number of years you up the preserving freedom ... you know preserving democracy\nAnd because of that you've given up a lot so when you come home and you become a civilian\nTo compensate you for that they give you certain things they give you a civil service they try and make the playing field even a gun and that's why\nSome guy who's been sitting home when protests them and do what other little freaky wants to do one every wants to do this is not a veteran and you know a lot in titled all these things that they put their life on hold like like veterans did\nKnow and and I think this guy here it's it's it's I don't even know if he's a good guy or a bad guy he's trying to hurt anybody but it does speak ignorance in the truest sense of the word\nLike they just don't get it they think that it's just a word and it doesn't mean anything and they don't understand what like you just said ... what do they mean when you top of the time that really is the key I mean never mind the fact that people sacrifice physically and emotionally and for their families\nBut it isn't the same thing and and and I just don't understand I Hope people listening because these are these crazy ideas that pop up\nAnd we all laugh about than say they're crazy and then slowly they build a little bit of momentum and then five years from now we'll find out that well you know\nWe weren't really call them a veteran but for for the purposes of benefits over here the this group can do it that that's what scares me about this is it's the opening salvo of a of a discussion that is going to lead to really diminishing people service\nOr ... what about ... ... try and do some some what ... rice and not know that's the wrong person at the office and\nPoison into you know and and the worst part of that as it turns out to be at a a navy veteran\nThat's just just just the way I just was sad about that because that's what what we haven't heard I mean that's crazy\nYou know it sounds like he may have been a little disgruntled um I think he did like four years and and uh was demoted twice you go you know I think maybe one or that sort of situation\nI tell you in a large I thought you'd be fired up you know that is is your favorite marine General Mattis is one of them\nIn trouble you and I like um what you like yourself but I have to say that while the Marines so you know dumping temples right or wrong with the marine corps brought by the way I think if you\nDidn't get mad as mine is isn't it it got it tells you the security dollars no I'm not I mean math is I don't think is open his mouth you know why [laughter] he's not saying that his dad would've just returned ... [laughter] yeah my uh my my wife worked in Congress back when the uh\nWhen the anthrax was sent there back right after nine eleven and everyone I Know that's a scary thing and they're just tell you how crazy the world has become but I I think the looks on the bright side the security measures seemed to work well in this one but they but like I said I mean I don't know why he was asked to Madison was uh\nI I think it just got to describe a veteran and he is I think he is and I think is but it it's hard because now you're going to find as everyone goes into that whole idea what you know when you see for veterans when you're watching to see that as a veteran don't you kinda say oh\nMan that makes us look bad yeah it wouldn't have ... ... ... jumbled dumb for her to grow up the top three ... you know Marines ... ensure the country's run on well\n... yeah and I I but I think uh I think we talked about it I think you know matters I think this is a special kind of guy um but I I I'm just ... it's incredible that this was the ... the science of it in the law enforcement that they found this guy so fast\nYeah I'm In the ... you'd expect that and ah you know it's the giants have it all your Marines and you know they put her her her know nicest there I think we're pretty much right or right the obituary for that group\nAt least in a battlefield yeah now the turn somewhere\nElse lots of things up them more in some other organization you know as soon as we look the other way but you know but that is important\nBecause ... they do the idea that they had that and you could call it the caliphate that mattered it mattered in terms of recruited terms in terms of the money they had from the oil I mean they do is they they were they were able to use it wasn't just land and they put a flag on it they were able to use it to make money\nThat well and you had Europeans going to join them [laughter] it's crazy I yeah\nAnd that's just I I think ISIS is going to be around for a long time or some version of it and I think that um\nAnything we can do to keep money from them is is going to help us in you know being I'm On the battlefield keep money from them but I'm concerned what's going to happen in Europe because so many people from the middle east have gone to Europe and I am not immigrant bashing but just that that that that\nI'm so she helps me plan events and do 'em\nDo the work that I Do for the commonwealth I'm so we have an event coming up in November at the state house women veterans appreciation day on November first\nUm so that's the day we give out the Deborah Sampson award um we have not chosen a recipient yet this year but we will be doing that hopefully next week I'm so ...\nJohn you know I haven't gotten your nomination for it and it's all too um but you know if someone wants to send went in will consider it um\nBut counseling does great work she's super supportive of the network and super supportive of me\nUm she helps out and does a lot of stuff um but the VA has been changing um over the last several years um as Mike and I were talking earlier um when I first came home from the military in Nineteen Ninety nine things were a little different um\nGenerally I got called sir uh [laughter] which doesn't happen anymore I'm but Carolyn is super I'm up to date with all the changes that the VA has made in women's health care so um she can talk about some of those changes so I don't know I I could just\nLet Gail talk for a while [laughter] you know I'm feeling pretty good right now [laughter] uh so I'm Carolyn Mason Wylie I'm the woman veterans' program manager at a Boston I'm\nOne of the biggest things that I Will tell everybody out there is that no matter where you are in the country there um every facility has a woman veterans a program manager that helps women coming into the VA to access their care to\nUm to establish their primary care mental health any other care that they might need and really help them navigate a system that can be a little overwhelming at times um but I Am very grateful to be here and thank you very much for having me\nSo Carol in the um VA now offers some fertility services for women veterans\nSo would you like to talk about that the VA does does offer fertility infertility uh workouts and and care um a lot of it is done in the community by um by providers who were in a contract with the a\nUm but this is also available to men so there's a lot of um a lot of the world cup that can be done um under VA um\n[noise] the standard benefits package there are some that are a little more restricted like the um in vitro fertilization is very restricted to those that have a service connected disability um that er that's related to their infertility but I'm a lot of lot of changes going on\nBecause he does it does have a major change in the way or the views and views have been doing a great job of trying to answer that that me women I mean women of different health needs in men and they have different ... and and it's it's ... it's a good to see that the views trying to address them\nYeah well I mean where you have to think about um maternity care and and contraception and I'm a menopause management and and um breast and cervical cancer screening and and all of these other issues that are very gender specific\nPlus the different ways that I'm ... disorders like um ... TST affects women and the way that um [noise] the way that that they that that might affect their\nPhysical health and their well being so there's a lot of connection there and ... really tried to change and keep up with the times and and welcome women into their their programs\nUm but I also have to say that the women veterans network in Massachusetts has been an amazing way to to bring women together and um and really try to offer some community and and support for women that are out there\nAnd I mean I I don't think as government or the federal or state government can can look the other way on women veterans who they are the fastest growing a veteran population the no comprise about twenty percent of the military\nAnd then what's different you don't want to I Want to make a blanket statement but a lot of times in World War two was it was a lot of medical nursing type of care that women veterans were and now the combat arms\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan there were many women veterans who saw combat ... completely changes the dynamic of what it used to look like\nWhen the war is over when the war is on the road\nYou know what was combat [laughter] it was a combat and wants to know that you know as you're talking to them and even combat and militias are opening up to two two women so it was going to be a different world um\nAnd that's the only job with the demographic shifting that has to change how you even you know you reach out to people because they you know women may have would they have different or if they're in trouble they may have\nFamilies with more than men or younger children so with the wound veterans' network or you know you're the acting director of the women veterans number for the state of Massachusetts\nI Am and I've been doing that now for a couple of years um and so it's you know I have a different um\nDifferent mannerisms in a different take on my role um but I Try to make\nIt more ... I ... I Want it to be more relaxed we all have enough stress in our lives so when the women are with us I Want them to be relaxed I Want them to enjoy themselves and I want them to know that there are appreciated for their service um and I also want to be um\nAnd I'm I'm a conduit I Want to be a conduit to\nThe women's programs at the VA I Want to you know that I Want to get them connected that'd be a health care because obviously self care and taking care of yourself as a mother as a wife those things are really important to do because there were so many stresses and things out there um and an\nEnd to to find out the the Facebook page for the a woman's veterans' network is Massachusetts when veterans if you just look that up on\nYeah I mean women veterans um so that's our Facebook page um we also have a Twitter which I don't have the Twitter handle at the moment but we also Twitter tweet Twitter tweet whatever [laughter] um I also do all of that so I'm when I'm not from\nFor people to find out that that you just have to find out what's going on including this event on November first she wants to be to add a little bit\nYeah so this is an our fourteenth annual women veterans appreciation day so this has been around a for several incarnations of\nYou know the women veterans network um and it's changed over time but we do now I'm offered the Deborah Sampson award um which is we take nominations usually beginning\nIn August September um we try to wrap up into\nThe reward is is with the woman veteran of the year award is over\nThe Deborah Samson award [noise] um so it's named after Deborah Sampson are revolutionary woman I'm so we um give that a war to an outstanding woman veteran and we take applications from everybody we take them from via so we take them from family members we take them from anyone who knows the woman\nThat trend that has gone above and beyond in her community um and ... in her service to other women veterans and the veteran community as a whole you know someone that is really outstanding outgoing and sort of just on the spot doing all kinds of good things for women veterans and veterans that like\nUm and we get several great nominees every year it's really hard hard to pick because there were so many outstanding nominations every year we really just get done and we're like oh oh my goodness you know\nUh I I definitely have to ... the women that have been nominated for the Denver Sampson award um have just been really outstanding um\nPublic service their military service their um their connections in their communities I I'm so impressed every year when we see those nominations and have to go through them and identify one I mean I Want to choose like ten every year and\nUm so it it's an amazing award but I think that the the\nProgram as a whole at the state house I'm really pays honor to the service that are women have 'em have engaged in for our ... our country\nUm it's one of my favorite days of the year it's it's such a beautiful ceremony and um it's nice to see the um\nDifferent senators and representatives and folks from the state has come down and and also pay on her\n... year when we go for some little school groups the former president and oh and she's a big supporter of Trump so\nYeah and you know we every year we send out um invitations but it's free you know I mean we send out invitations to different senators and and everything but it's free it's open to the public anybody can come um you know we do serve coffee and doughnuts and light refreshments at the end\nHow ...
