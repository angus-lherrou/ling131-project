New York times story they talked about how each party is sort of handling getting the veteran vote in a different way where the Democrats are running a ton of veterans a ton of veterans I sort of like they did in two thousand six and only about five out of fifty actually won\nBut what they were ... they really article which was really interesting it was time how the Democratic party\nIsn't reaching out in any concerted way to veterans themselves and how far ahead of the game the Republicans are on that\nI Wonder if that's going to a show some ... pay some dividends for them in the in the upcoming a congressional race how do you I just don't understand how you can micro target is that what they call every single demographic group and have no concerted outreach to the veterans\nThey would their argument is is uh from\nThe DNC is that they're twenty million dollars if they're putting into a outreach across the country will filter down to veterans and their they have again\nI mean I think nationwide they say four hundred veterans running for Congress this year as a ton of veterans\nBut I just it's going to be interesting to see whether or not people vote based on that or or on other issues I don't think anyone's really done any real studies on exactly how veterans' vote they just sort of expect that veterans vote one way or another and then they read into it but I think the shows that the Democrats on this one are sort of shooting blind\nYeah and I don't think of veterans is going to automatically blindly vote for a fellow veteran either\nNo and then it's shown and I think that um some of the people that have running I mean there's only so many West Point graduate you gonna run for office\nAnd I don't know if that I mean that's not bad you know West Point but I just don't I think uh they said six percent was the difference\nUh in the two thousand sixteen election veterans voted innovative six percent higher than non veterans why wouldn't you look at that twenty million dollar pool with twenty dollar twenty million number of group of veterans and try to get to find what's going on because they all have families to\nYeah and you know what I don't think it's just because you're a veteran you're going to vote for them you want to look at these issues that concern you know I mean\nThere are a\nLot ... particular issues that concern you as a veteran right in the union address in ... another veteran be more likely to address those issues on ... and I think you're going to vote for the person that represents your best interests\nIn issues is I mean here in Massachusetts let's face it it doesn't really move the needle we all knew I was going to win in four weeks we all know who's going to be the senators me on the regime your congressman\nThe uh the the fun part of it the next month will see the three debates with Elizabeth Warren but I think even deal if you ask them was some truth CERN will tell you he has no shot at winning what he's trying to do is is inflicting damage in those debates on was with Warren should she run for president and raise his own his own profile or nothing wrong with that but let's face it we know he's not going to win\nNationwide these in in swing states these could be the difference these votes can be the difference and the Republicans have a lot of data on veterans in terms of votes that the voters that the Democrats just don't have and and I don't know if it's something that's just about veterans or is this symptomatic of a bigger problem with the Democratic national campaign committee\nDo they not you know because I knew anyone who's read about the ah sixteen race not to get too much in the weeds that people in the state level we're always screaming that the Clinton campaign\nAnd the DNC were not working closely with them and not giving them the resources they need it on the ground and do their job so well it it can almost be sort of a canary in the mind that the DNC is in his organized as we thought\nWell yeah I mean running candidates for Congress is risky anyways 'cause you're you're talking most likely someone that\nThat that may be their first election and you're going for a major seat as\nOpposed to someone that kinda organically worked their way up from a ... council or mayor's office or state rep state senator or something like that so you know you wonder if they're if they're just using veterans just to say that they're trying to get the veteran vote and\nMaybe this is the way they you know you do get ... ... any which way you slice it if they get in a Congress that is good for us I think that's good for the countries they do you think on average if you have more veterans in there but again going back to what motivates a veteran devote I think it depends on the veteran a new career military where the end for four years do they go where where did they serve\nAnd I don't think we've ever seen any real studies encounter if you've heard either um\nThey talk about what issues motivate veterans is a defense do they vote differently on foreign policy issues than they do on social issues right ... people are in in or what they considered a cross pressured you know what I mean you could be a a person who's very liberal on social issues on on economic issues but more of a conservative on foreign policy issues and how does that break down when it comes\nTo venues you become an older veteran like any old was ... you might have interests federal real wind would dump you might be more concerned about transportation medication things like that you know what's going to help you when you're old wife you know well\nThe interesting because under the Trump Administration the last two years the VA past the Congress passed a VA mission act\nOr so that's a big fundamental change with with with the department of veteran affairs or you know primarily focused around um choice in privatization a little bit\nIf you have the desire Chris

um but I wanted to follow up a little bit on it the or the social justice lawyers that one veteran benefits\nNo it all started off because they want ... percent off a a from a veterinarian bail 'em but this was this was the take from Dr Warren Jay blooming felt a he's an adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst\n... didn't you go there you'll ... yeah well you know he he I guess he's jealous you know and he thinks that social warriors because you know they promote peace and and liberty and things like that I guess\nUm you know they should get some of those benefits so I managed to uh you know ... would they be eligible for VA benefits and veteran license plates and things like that so on get you guys are take on it and and I don't think there's some other thoughts to\nWell are they\nGoing to stay out of social ... water use a ...\n... post ... you know maybe they should yeah nothing until the war started and then the coming up to social ... sweatshirt some old ... bumper stickers sober convention ...\nTo ... you know this stuff but\nI think gives you a bad reputation you know I mean I mean it's the I'm happy valley you know that's what you wrote to what people what I mean what the heck the ... of a sacrifice you know\nWell that was my you know one of my big arguments you know he thinks he deserves temples shut off because I don't know no he's he would probably say no I don't deserve that I just want the title [laughter]\nI Know he doesn't even to serve the ... it's a slippery slope because you know if they if they get the discounts and they're going to want the benefits is a little bit of pushback though there was another article written in the by the Brookings Institute\nA by a guy named uh or two people a murder Carlin in order to win and forgive me Alice ... fried friend forgive me and\nThey talked about how there's it's not right that the people who were in the military get confidence from the general public about having about being good people and they ...\nWe should not ask you for your sort of yeah well they they're they're they're upset that they that there are people getting hired to be or when people are talking about foreign policy they're looking to the military for it and then they're blaming the lack of confidence in the civilian leadership on the military being praised two different things\nThat I mean it is but it is but there is a pushback how they'd like these people here they were talking about it almost in terms you can tell they were like very upset because\nThey think they're smarter than these guys were in the military\nOf course of course that's what it is I'm a little bit of that feeling from this guy to\nIt's a myth they say it's a myth more virtue if you're you're in the military you\nKnow it's funny that the you know they have all these opinions but you know did they spend any time in Iraq or Afghanistan or Vietnam or have they spent any time and a third world and I was part of my argument to\nUm you know so you want benefits because yeah hell to picket sign for for an hour or two and and then went home to see a first world house that you know you have a roof over your head you have food you have electricity have plumbing there were veterans give up you know when when they're on on missions or or their training\nI go to a little bit I think there's something to be said for the fact that in this country no one can ever be felt made to feel bad\nAbout some you know you can be made to feel ... you cannot be made to feel like you're less than someone else so why wouldn't people strive for that title\nEighty percent of the country has confidence in the U.S military as opposed to twenty five percent of Congress looked at you know that's what this is a ... it's ... in a jealousy and like a kid jealousy but there's something like ... ... oh yeah it is but it's if people want to grab onto that title and when I'm On\nThe military what is your putting homes where whether you've gone to Vietnam War but you are over in Iraq Afghanistan whatever\nYou'll have given up your freedoms you're serving in an era where you where you do not have personal freedom you're subjected to\nA military control people tell you what to do you up here to defend your country and to defend double people and you just do not have free will you have to do what you're told and you're doing that for two three four six years and you\nGive that up and then you're ... other people you appears back home\nGetting educated\nAnd throwing in the career is progressing buying homes so when you come back and they say okay we're going to give you a ... a bill or whatever because guess what you want them to make much money in the military\nGuess what we're gonna help you or obtain civil service or a protection get a job because we're trying to even the playing field that's the only given you a break that's just trying to make things even those four he couldn't guy whose home\nHolding the sign periodically do you know advance who's believes\nThat's going to win the any thing and he wants to get a discount because of that I find that absurd and I don't see the logic and the and what does he teach ...\nI don't know well because the shouldn't be philosophy you shouldn't be watch ... because it just doesn't make sense what he's doing\nWell with these uh which friend and Carlin from the ... Institute are saying is it the admiration\nFor the military has come at the expense of our civilian leadership no no the civilian leadership and our country has screwed their own ... the reason people don't have confidence and it was 'cause they've earned that lack of confidence is not there isn't a zero sum game you know where it was like there was a hundred percent we took it away the fact is no one in this country has sacrificed\nFences nine eleven we told me after George Bush call what it is totally want to go to the mall and there's no bonds there is no nothing no one rationing anything no one did anything for this war for the last Seventy miles except for the people who served\nMilitary were and after the you know what works and what doesn't work and they stay focused on that they're not entering into foreign policy or anything like that they're focused on what's working in the military field and the answer it but\nI think part of what he failed to realize is that military does a lot of peace keeping missions yeah I Do a lot of humanitarian missions\nThey think that these social justice or is it only on one's doing peace and you know do the only ones doing humanitarian help which I Would I Would argue or you know or are they doing anything for for victims of of of natural disasters you know what exactly are they doing um the other thing I Do more ...\nThey look at your guys the veterans without a lot of even once they will be the military these guys are imbued with a sense of social justice where they come out and they'd go while the countries that help\nOr develop our water or resources some things like that you know that's right and then there's something they've learned that in the middle of a ...\nI Do think this comes from an easy thing it's just not for you yeah like you can we can pass you on the back of the good things about you but what makes you ... how entitled of a society are we people grow up seeing you know I Know everyone uses word veteran and it has a good good a ... a vibe do it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Soundoff: The Veteran's Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "13"}
