that's what happened ... came in there and no one noticed or that was my idol maybe this is the new model [laughter]\nHave already you have anything that I yeah I Want to direct people to our website a cause I posted this I think it's hilarious video about\nIt's about a dog that the older address the dial up as a crocodile for Halloween read\nAnd I don't know I guess the owner like just position this dog and a local park is kind of like IV vigor dusk right and apparently this dog likes to run around and bark at people well it but the dog down just rate I don't know in the bushes there at all of a sudden like the first couple of ... and the dog starts\nYou know going out and it starts barking at them but it looks like it's a rocket aisle and so people are like hysterical they're like running and screaming and I think it's hilarious and this whole new\nShows this dog which is dressed as the crocodile chasing after people and it doesn't look like a you know accused the ... you know little crocodile literally looks like a crocodile and I think it's hilarious it's on our website W archaea ... since\nMorning show I actually saw that video\nAnd it does look real and it is you would jump oh yeah and he said but it moves a little faster than I think what your average down my because that little duck it it goes to what you said the other day though about how many people are dressed in their dogs up yeah hat's up for Halloween mhm\n[laughter] I got to figure out what my dogs are going to be I don't know yet so you definitely are dressing them probably well I think my fiance is actually he's he's into like he's he just do some of the dogs and loves you know driving them up and different things and so he's probably going to be more enjoyed the me surprisingly the hell probably pick out the Gostin\nOriented needs to get married and have kids ... and they need to [noise]\nI was actually given you can trust your dog up\nAm I Know can I stop it from happening probably not be will it be dressed up\nI Would start going as [noise] yeah I don't know whatever it is he's going to be pissed off about it he doesn't like\nIt and you know to people ever address their dogs as cash probably dog let that go\nI've never seen it but I've never seen a dog is a lion or any kind of again\nOh I've seen a cat dressed as a lion\nThat I dug has been a cowboy and electric on so far on let me go back to my tenure lightning said I've seen a cab dressed as a lion and as I was saying I agree she snuck in that was really cool I wasn't agreeing whether that was really old I was only agreeing with I've seen that\nI've got the big me I mean and it's just it's really\nFunny [noise] I think it's [noise]\nThey put their front paw through and then it's up around their head\nAbout that in ... do not one comes from a much higher than\nThe glad they're really not into it and yeah they don't like it is I I'm not into it that's for sure\nAlright friends we get all the right there oh we'll be back tomorrow I'm trying to think for giving anything away tomorrow no but we are going to we're going to have a really great interview tomorrow which is can be fascinating [noise] serial killer's daughter joining us tomorrow\n... he joined us for that have a great day\nVoice of Boston New York about one hundred point seven till UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] good morning I'm\nNick ... W. R. Keanu\nReeves tropical storm Michael is still bringing damaging winds to parts of the U.S today my power reports\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the U.S nearly fifty years and the third strongest ever Michael is now a tropical storm as it moves out of Georgia heading to South Carolina the national Hurricane Center is warning that the storm is still bringing damaging winds leaving tornado watches and warnings in its path you need she said it's expected that the core of Michael move across central and eastern Georgia\nTo ... going to push 'em up which is going to slow the economy or beef producers are going to have to say hey we can't actually pass these costs through the consumers so we can't pass these inflationary costs through less profit they're going to go down so it means one of those two things\nAnd so I look at all that and it's so similar to the ... we saw right after the super bowl in February where that friday the friday before we got a bang up jobs report in it for for the month of January and the following week that Monday eleven hundred and Seventy five points down on the doubt three days later on Thursday in additional seven hundred plus points down\nAnd we're sitting there going well what happened is is is good news bad again is bad news good what what is actually mean\nAnd the fact is this is a case where I think investors are so focused on the fear of potential inflation which don't get me wrong I I think that's out there too but I think the couple that with the fact that Jerome Powell a couple of days ago said\nYeah we think we still have a ways to go on interest rates we don't think we're anywhere near the neutral right we're going to continue to hike and we're gonna continue to move forward and I think it was just this combination of things if you look at what actually changed in the last week there was the only things that are out there we get nothing new one midterms we get nothing new on what's going on it\nI don't know about that I don't I I Know we hate to get into politics on this but the uh the cabinet thing has awakened to the Republican base in a lot of the country in a way nobody saw but to change anything from a policy perspective\nA you know that's a good point because you wind up with sort of the kind of divided paralyzed paintings and a half an hour could like with the exception of what happens in the house and\nYou know to what extent is even attrition pinned down by multiple investigations out of the house representatives so I I look at this and I say yeah they ... there's not much moving you aside from these inflation fears\nAnd when I look at something along those lines those are things that the market can overcome in the long run because we we saw earlier this year they they did okay the inflation that we thought we were going to see over the first six months to this year didn't materialize at least not in miserable for you know didn't show up in the CPI the PC or any of those numbers that\nWe look at and so those are things that the market can get over what it can't get over okay if you do have a material change from a political perspective Italy decides look we can't get along with Germany and we need to leave the euro zone hey that's the material change from how the world is today\nThat's something that you don't just get over that you have to completely rebuild your model of how the world looks and how it works\nSo from my perspective worries about inflation things that you can get over especially because Jay Powell could come out tomorrow and say\nHey I Know I said this last week but here's what I really meant by it and all of a sudden this whole thing goes away just like that it's done so and I tend to look at interest rate hikes from the ... we've had bizarrely low interest rates for ten years and you know it's actually it's banned the fed giving the\nKids a sugar water for ten years and the faster we get back to normal interest rates that can be lowered you know when there's an actual economic downturn to stimulate the economy the factory unwind the whole ... uh you know taking the streets down to zero experiment the better as far as I'm concerned\nIf it's a little painful and the short term and let's talk about that a little bit here okay because I think there was a really good case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis hey we've got to get rates low in order to make sure that the whole thing doesn't fall apart but then keeping them low for so long I think a lot of investors got accustomed to it\nAnd they stopped looking at stocks on a fundamental basis of what company can actually continue to exist if things normalize and they said\nHey the punch bowls open why don't we buy shares of tests well because\nIt's not going to let him go out of business still keep rates low so they can keep borrowing that's not normal though which the ... job and this is my not just my view this is how their charters written\n... job is not to keep companies in business doesn't say that anywhere in their mandated not hey let's keep the stock market up and keep companies and business the feds mandate control inflation make sure that we are as close to full employment as possible correct so\nFrom my perspective I think a lot of investors got a little bit complacent and when they finally got down in and said gee Powell signaling this and now you've got a little inflation showing up in a couple of places they panicked because they may you may have been out over their skis a little bit\nPanic so reversible you know it's again you can you can put that genie back in the bottle it takes time took three months to kind of get the market back to normal this spring but it did so I look at this it's a short term fluctuation I think you're going to see continued volatility do you think that's I mean these things don't go away overnight would you agree\nNo I mean you're at the point where uh you know let's remember that were nine and a half years into you know one of the greatest bull markets of uh all the time and you know they don't go on forever and there are\nA corrections and there are changes and you know you've seen in the treasury market or to see treasury trading around three point to the U.S at a tiny and seven years yeah and you know when the summer they were two point eight so that's been you know for a forty basis point move in the treasury market or in just a matter of weeks is\nYou know rarely do you describe the treasury market as dramatic but that's pretty

NASDAQ about steady\nOr we don't need drama like we saw yesterday [noise] no we we certainly do do it it certainly looks when we take a look just on a sector by sector basis\nEnergy and financial still getting hit hard today both of them down close to one percent a healthcare also in the red as well but tech having a nice little bounce back up point three percent communication services which is you know the new sector that was created has a lot of the social media companies and so forth\nUp about a quarter percent for some of the hardest to companies bouncing back initially I think time will tell us whether this is a dead cat bounce here or something that's for real\nAnother thing that I find fascinating Delta Airlines up close to five percent or improving as of right now you met a continental up a two point nine percent makes me wonder if a ... got a little oversold yesterday on fears of jet fuel disruptions out of\nHurricane Michael but that's that was an interesting surprise to me\nI was wondering what have you been uh do you have any fights planned or the rest of the fall or the holiday season or anything that lamp to for Thanksgiving what have you seen price wise they can't get my wife to agree on what we're going to fly so no you know it's a it's a a flying around Thanksgiving is just painful [noise]\nYou know I just buy the ticket and cause mass\nIt seems like those prices are a lot higher this year than one or two years ago and I wonder ... being able to if they're seeing hey we can actually push through some price increases because the demand is there\nRight now people are you know a three point seven percent unemployment and a comedy doing better and you know I always feel like I'm all the things I waste money on airfare for Thanksgiving to be with family that's something I'm pretty happy to waste money on but you know it's our truck I was\nGoing to ask her are you doing you're a annual a fly on the day after Thanksgiving this year\nNot this year and find two days earlier do go to our don't go down a little bit earlier otherwise would have been\nAbsolutely fine but I'm going to ... the big thing so I'm going after a Christmas this year I'm heading down to a Florida for a few days and just you know get a little bit of sun and you know kind of reset for early winter into force and the big thing that I'm seeing is the fights are just nutty right now like eight hundred dollars plus unless you\nA fly on Christmas Day or on New Year's day pretty much while I'm so it it's just nuts whereas in previous years you know I'd be able to find stuff you know half that cost a lot of cases even not on those May Day so it's definitely a lot more expensive it seems like\nI haven't got to the point where I was poking around on spirit that's how desperate I'd gotten to find a cheap flight\nAnd careful somebody's going to come on board with a squirrel that ... by the time I finally like figure it out like how much it was all going to cost if I actually had a seat on the plane if I had to carry on bag it was still going to be like almost the same amount as anyone else so\nI punted on that just because\nI flew spirit one's going to Atlantic City but uh you know there's a difference and being stuck on a plane for forty five minutes like that and ... dock on one like it sounds like a really great trip you fly on spirit airlines and then when you get off the plane you're in Atlantic City [noise]\nYeah it it everything kind of matches you know it's just like okay I I I Know what I'm getting into on this on all counts but\nI just for a longer fight I'm just not sure that it gets quite what I Want that comprise free trips to Atlantic City on spirit or what what's third more of them nine trips [laughter]\nAnyways that is Wall Street watch presented by leader bank and the rent landlords stop chasing down late payments and skip the trip to the bank now he can sit back relax while we rent collects rapidly chronically\nSigned up today at the rent dot net or call seven one six for one eight six nine one for details so that CBS edited the finally getting approval by the Justice Department huge news for\nOur listeners or a ... a listener audience a given that you could see the U.S and one second Rhode Island at night in Hartford and a part of the CBS has at least promising for now they're going to keep a several thousand jobs in Hartford for four\nYears uh but if this you know is a move that really kind of solidifies\nAre both companies at the end um CBS you know as you see Wal Mart getting into health insurance to so much cost pressure uh this'll be a very interesting deal to see\nIf the rationale behind it really uh plays out as we expect now I did see a number of states have granted their conditional approval to this is well I Know that New York is potentially holding this up\nOr just because New York if they're in the yard if you've ever dealt with the insurance market in New York\nIt's one of the most highly regulated in the country there companies affected we have to create specific products for the New York market\nSo I Do think there might be one last turtle there but it sure seems like this is moving in the right direction at this point and it's been a long time coming here and you get a signal that big a competitor to buy and express rips holding\nAnd just everybody is looking at this a shakeout turned going in the world of health insurance\nAnd pharmacy benefits and you know more and more as far as we can see\nFor the next several decades more and more of a health care spending is going to be going into pharmaceuticals to keep us alive wander and deal with chronic illness and that's the place to be folks severe landlord a property manager I'm sure you've heard me talk about the rent the leader banks tremendous online rent collection program but I'm excited to tell you now\nYeah and it's a matter of fact we can seen what happened yesterday before\nAnd here's what I'm getting at I'm going back to Nineteen fifty during bull markets and this is certainly a bull market there had been twenty times when the ... five hundred trade it down at least three percent on one single day and then if you look forward to month\nThe U.S and the five hundred and Ninety percent of the time has rallied almost seven percent so a we've seen this before is where is it is and in these kinds of movies in bull market do happen typically their opportunities to buy and you're absolutely right\nNothing mentally change yesterday if anything headline that the wall Street Journal literally just put out\nProbably you were calling the um is that a President Trump and she plans to speak at the G twenty coming up in November and from my point of view that actually is is a change and it's good news um so you know that that that that's my take on on where we are at this moment\nHad on the book to drill down to specific issues are is you're looking around at a individual stocks anything that's looking interesting to you today 'cause it took maybe too much of a pounding over the last week\nYeah my whole portfolio although in in you know I'm I'm kinda whispering past breakup look I go up you know call it and a half percent\nUm I gave up three percentage points over the past two weeks though that's been painful you know you have to go from ten to six and a half but there'll be a as I look at my portfolio now and I have forty nine name in position\nI'm I've been adding to them on the field that I think are most apropos certainly for our listeners um believe it or not China I think China's gotten way over done I'm looking at Ali Baba\n... be a be a bomb and that way though take or W.

next month it just doesn't make sense and you know the one upside uh to what we're seeing with interest rates is you know you look go shopping for an online CD or online savings account\nAnd those numbers are finally starting to look you can you can find two years CDs at two seven five almost three percent now and if that's money you need twenty four months from now\nOr you know in in my experience\nUh the last upside to you know money that you could have had in the stock market for two years is so much less painful than the downside of money left in the stock market to like let's say that you've got ten thousand dollars but you put away for a car you know you need a car in the next year okay\nIs it worth trying to get that up to eleven thousand with the danger that it could fall down to seven in my book it's not just because you don't know what the market's going to do in the short term so I I\nYou agree with you on that this does lead us to our poll question of the day how worried are you about the markets sell off very worried slightly worried are not worried at all Tucker what kind of results are we seeing in a in the pulled us for\nA leading the way right now is a amongst our listeners are not worried at all at forty two percent fall by slightly worried at forty percent and uh finishing a distant third is very worried at Seventeen percent\nAnd I I like already and I think they've dealt with threats you know it's ... and again it's not saying that you know you shouldn't look at this and say gee that's interesting that the market felt you know three and a half percent yesterday but if you've allocated yourself properly it shouldn't make a difference in your overall long term plan and that's that's the big thing that you need\nTo be focused on what to talk a little bit about what President Trump is focused on because we had a couple of comments from him yesterday specifically\nAre with regards to the Federal Reserve a with him saying that the fed had quote John loco arose rather was going loco ... he's bilingual who knew what's what's your take on this uh it it's a\nYou know it's a unique approach to a speaking about the fed or president has unique approach to speak about a lot of different things for you know the past forty four presidents typically a you had them not making critical comments about fed and fed policy and sort of\nYou know trying to stay out of that and um you know it's part of the whole deal that I think you get with this current president he's going to speak his mind in a way that we have not been a particularly accustomed to before this\nAnd um you know I Would say on the on the merits of it um it looks to me like the fed is being anything but logo you know now is the time with what we're seeing with inflation with economic growth\nIf now is not the time to get back to a scene interest rate policy when is\nAnd and I think the you know a lot of people talk about okay is you know is it appropriate that the president's talking about the fed and this and that and what the defense of bunch of grown ups thinking fend for themselves so I'm not worried about you know did the president break the fourth wall and talk to the fed when ...\n... they're grown ups they can deal with themselves they're all adults they all knew how to handle themselves they're all mature people who can you know deal with things like this\nWhat I'm curious about in in what I kind of get out of this\nKnow 'cause everyone will go through that and said oh you know defense supposed to be independent how could you do this I Will get in and ask what if he's right okay where is he writes ... is the wrong from my perspective\nI don't think he's right on this but here's why I don't think he's right when you look at what the fed is doing here they have a dual mandate okay their mandate is to keep inflation in check\nAnd maintain full employment okay there's supposed to do both of those things with the current policy that they are are they are doing both of those things inflation is in check it's not too hot and we are at full employment so when I look at what the fed is doing\nI don't really have a huge problem with it in the interim okay now they could get to a point where they start to escalate to quickly and maybe they start to cause a slow down that leads to unemployment okay hasn't happened yet hasn't happened so I'm not going to criticize them for something that they haven't done to this point\nThey don't have a mandate to maintain stock prices in the narrow range so\nI don't really get upset at the fed if the market you know it was kind of waking up to this and saying gee there's a threat here that we didn't really pricing properly and now we need the prices in that's the markets fault not the feds and you don't have to worry about mid term elections for weeks\nNo no it's ... and so when when I look at this I say you know it's it's it's interesting 'cause everyone jumped right to oh should the president be doing this I see what it doesn't matter whether he should or not the fed can handle themselves\nThe question is is he right is is he on the money on this end to this point the fed has neither caused a recession nor have they caused additional inflation and so when I look at it I say hey I I don't think the criticisms warned that if he wants to say it go ahead to Durham pelican handle themselves and if you're shocked by the president saying shocking things\nYou probably need to get a wake up wake up ... wherever you been for the last three years so I don't have a problem with him saying it because again the fed can deal with it\nBut the interesting thing is pay like ... if their merit behind this and that's where I think the ... really is on this would

I mean look at all the overtime games this year or two\nTon of 'em and and the the the games seem more competitive and there's a or the NFL is a quarterback driven league at this point oh yeah that it's all the rules against the defenses yeah there are so many good quarter but like whether you're talking you know people making their first starts like Patrick homes or someone like that\nYou have interesting stories in terms of quarterbacks to new locations you got her cousin's going up to Minnesota\nYou know you've got a lot of good quarterbacks now where did you go back you know five or ten years ago\nAnd the picture was just like there were a lot of teams that just didn't have a chance you know they they get on the field and it's a great you're starting Chad Pennington again great you're going to look like you have nothing that you can do their\nWares this year it's hey you know we're the Cleveland Browns we've been awful forever\nBut let's see what Baker may feel that you know it's just that there's a little bit more interest especially in some cities that I think down and out for a while there are other cities that are going to continue to be down and out for a while but it seems to be more competitive as a whole\nSo the anthem protests everything like that has had zero effect on the ratings this year you know and all the time they're not showing the old for that\nAnymore and I also wonder you know we're way has the uh current capital Nike ad campaign in some ways that ... to do that sort of pulled some energy on that whole issue away from the NFL and put it into Nike and that's probably good for football\n[noise] the thing that I still find fascinating on that whole thing is\nYou know you you of Nike sponsoring the NFL and that gives it it's a really interesting juxtaposition in I I don't know how I don't know if we've ever seen is to ... like that before but it's it's fascinating just to see how that works out uh with regards to you know what what's going on there", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "11"}
