I just don't have it on yeah but I mean I think ... I think that becomes very extensive thought well you know to\nMe if I'm going to take the kids the dinner if I go to cheesecake and\nYeah but I'm Talking deadline on day if I go to McDonalds it's not yeah but once a day that gets that gets ... cents of just going anywhere once a day you know Randy is ready to use to be the guy who was went out to lunch every day you know and then after a while he was sort of like my husband he's like oh no\nBut I don't get that bad morals for the price of Randy Starbucks I mean that's the reality of it like\nHappy meals in Britain yeah in kids' meals at restaurants as a general are pretty damn cheap some of them free of threads heroin in particular but uh some a lot of them have specials or whatever but anyway so those are the number\nOf interesting because I didn't want him to re and do it at least once a day\nJim how about you what's going on you got anything ... yep a\nJohnny Walker has announced that they're releasing a new a label special branch for the final season of game of Thrones and they're calling it a white Walker really yes\nThere will be a new a special type it'll only be around for the ones using the game of Thrones out and I'll be releasing it next year so what are the labels currently jam I Can't remember it's Johnnie Walker black genuine correct on her Walker read Johnnie Walker I think there's a green his air I Believe now there'll be white ad in the spring and yes\nSpecial blend has notes of ... of fresh red berries with a touch of orchard fruit is best served chilled king would have no other way\nThat will do very well mhm I'll bet it does and there'll be a group of people out there most of them you know feeling early thirties effort drinks for the first couple of ingredients you said okay that's an hour and the ... the orchard stop time\nAnd I mean it's a scotch it's going to taste like Scott like Ben Rhodes are all sort of subtle right right right right and\nI said it's a great marketing ploy to get more power to him good for them not only their first new one I I you know blend I think for a while right I don't know if they do that very often so that's pretty cool\nUm I have an etiquette question that I Want to ask and I think this is particularly a relevant because Merida is going to be getting married so uh there's apparently this\nBride who lives in Britain and she and her husband are having what they are referring to as an abroad wedding\nSo they're getting married and I'm not exactly sure where they're getting married and they live in Britain and so if it were abroad maybe here in the state it may be down in the Caribbean I don't know\nBut apparently they are getting married in the winter and they're going to a warm place so for gas it's a it's a two week extravaganza\nIt's incredibly expensive to travel at the time of year that the wedding is planned and they're having a wedding at a very expensive resort so um it's very expensive to stay there and now the bride has sent out a how she's done this I don't know whether it's through registration or whatever\nThat she wants what she is demanding nice gifts\nSo this leads me to believe that these are gifts that are above the average pay grad\nNight he just you know that's a dollar sign\nSo in addition to the fact that these people all have to go to the wedding and spend all this money\nDo something so this woman who is a member of our family but it's not saying has put out on social media the question do I have to buy this after all I'm not going to be able to go on vacation again with my family for a year and a half or two years because I'm going to this wedding\nI feel like this is just too much I think the wedding is too long and I have young children were asking my husband to stay away from his job for that long and I feel like I have to attend the wedding so do I have to have this gift\nNo I think that's rude I think that's inappropriate\nFor them to ask very nice gift like only by me this gift and by the way it has to be a certain amount of money or else I'm going to be happy\nHeard of good friend that is a friend that enough that you would travel for that you couldn't say to them hey I'm making an effort to come so forget the gift park the gift is the fact that I'm coming because you know how much it costs to me rain but it's really if\nThey're going to tell you that I was I was having a wouldn't travel on close friend's wedding and I was having a\nDestination wedding honestly and I knew that people were going to come there and spend that money I Would say on my indications no gift\nRequired or no gifts please yes\nBecause that's the gifted in of itself that you came and you spent that money and you came there\nYou'll have some showers along the way you'll have some opportunity to get the top of where you don't need to have somebody bring you a wedding gift when they've traveled and they're they're and they're spending money and doing all that I don't think people still give you something they will you're exactly right cheat on bringing\nUp these types of stories though because of that one draws near\nWill make sure she gets the message not to expect very nice gift\nDestination wedding singer I ... I was just you know should I have never been to a destination wedding so I've never been in that position to do um and there was no ... I'm not going to Hawaii for just a you're getting married no\nI thought about it we did think about it but a media we might be on like nope no we're not doing it because our family and friends aren't able to afford that and that and ... and I just threw out the idea and like should we shouldn't we like I was an adamant on it I just was like would it be easier and then you know they're not\nDoing it for people saw\nIt on your wedding that easily\nThe wedding song is still to be determined right down the day\nI can tell you this I mean this is not really compared but he did it was for me\nA good chunk of my friends got married in the first year and a half we were out of college and I remember I did have I was in like maybe eight or nine weddings there was I was I was in a sorority so I had a lot of girlfriends so there's a lot of ridiculous weddings and I had one girlfriend\nWho they put us up or they had a hotel room and all this when we get there it turns out worth the Ritz Carlton and I had to pay that bill\nI I really didn't have the money to pay it but we I put it on my charge card and this is after she had already had chosen address that at the time was like five hundred bucks which was out wages for me and so that to me was so expensive and it was a big deal for me you know\nYou can't get out of college and so the idea that now I'd be asked to go to some resort and the Caribbean and oh by the way you need to bring crystal\nYeah that's a little much I mean I I'm renting a place the night before but I'm not asking my bridesmaids to pay for it I like that something that we're going to like take care of but that\nYou do that I don't do that ask them to pay for it will get a good topic I don't know why am I right I actually have an update though I didn't talk about this in a while I don't know if I brought this up I\nDid choose just one maid of honor I did choose one maid of honor was he'd chew so everybody's already been chosen and I have a brides men\nI have a bright man and I are\nAwesome I Do I have a brides man what does that mean that the male friend of mine got to stand up and I thought well you have to bridesmaids no I have a ... man he stands with the rest of the bridesmaid's do you have to bridesmaids what about you but I had no I ...\nI don't vote yeah he ... Hanlin grinds man\nWill use your acted like you made a tough choice but then you didn't because you have two of them\nI think that's awesome the bride maid of honor and I made it look like he's just in Britain he's just wears ranting guy okay yeah that's where I'm no yeah I Know that now he is awesome I I yeah that's fine he's on he's excited and\nI Know he's like I'm not wearing a dress though have you on that one now\nUnfortunately we got to leave it right there we keep going on about ... wedding we well we got we have a great day everybody moved back tomorrow six\nBoys so Boston you walk working about one hundred point seven till you see a like a C to Boston and I are radio station\nSouth Korea ... their exports tend to correlate pretty well in general with overall earnings of global corporations just cause South Korea so heavy for manufacturing and they're they're they're they're kind of this key country where they export both to Asia which is growing rapidly\nAnd they're also big in terms of exports to Europe and the U.S which were developed there his sense on exactly Samsung L G those types of companies Hyundai all and then you go down the list South Korean exports year over year for the month of September ... came in at negative eight point two percent\nWow so you've got a proxy for China because China never tells the truth it's a\nProxy for China and forward demand in the U.S and so the last time that we saw numbers like this from South Korea mhm was back in late twenty Fifteen early twenties sixteen when we are all that money coming out of the global economy because of oil prices crying so\nThis is one of those things where I take a look at the chart and this number by the way if you go back a year okay a year ago that number was ... plus thirty four percent\nYou know the ... and a lot of people would have thought that number would be increasing because you're hearing about American companies like a Costco stockpiling Walmart is stockpiling product because they're anticipating these tariffs\nAnd and I think what this suggests to me you could see that what could you know you mentioned hey you know not enough workers can kick off the next recession it could also be what we call an inventory recession where companies have stockpiled so much product that they say look we don't need to order anything else\nIn factory orders slow for a couple of quarters and it puts you into a mild recession that doesn't mean the world comes to an end to but it it does mean that hey you might see a little pull back and markets as you go forward twelve or Eighteen months\nYou know it is interesting the fed yesterday a drone Paulos in Boston talking and he said you know I I'm not worried about labor markets overheating [noise] boy I Am I like I must be the only\nPerson that's concerned about it I I look at what's going on with with Amazon just did\nA and was other companies having difficulty hiring workers not a day goes by where we don't report on labor strikes for somebody's going out on strike or work or like good Mariette workers just went out on strike [laughter] what's the problem with labor markets overheating [noise]\nIt means that wages go up and in the short term corporate profits go down why is that a bad thing\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing in the long term in the short term it can cause a state if all of a sudden Mariette Mrs their earnings estimates quarter after quarter because they have to pay their workers more money or Amazon or BJ's or Cosco all these companies have to pay more money for their workers\nIn the short term it hits their earnings per share in Wall Street will cause those stocks to go down may not be bad for the economy being the economy might actually benefit from higher wages to lower paid work\nIn my view also is that stress is stress stress is what produces forward progress in technology and into the economy it's when you have a company that saying gee we can't figure out how to meet earnings because our costs are going up to watch\nIt if not a question of hey we don't have enough sales we can make it say what what ... what can we do to innovate to figure out how to degenerate better profit and I'd like to see that 'cause that's where a company like marriage says\nGee you know what we're going to figure out a way we're going to get better technology for our cleaning staff so that instead of cleaning it ruins the day they can do nine and instead of\nUh having our kitchen work in this way we're going to have that I like to see that I I like companies that are a little stress because it forces them to innovate sure I don't like when companies are all comfortable saying oh gee we got low borrowing costs low wage we would have companies had to do the last eight years to make money hasn't been too hard\nIt is it and they haven't had to innovate Tucker or when your son is born are you going to limit his\nUsually and said son [laughter] yeah even though you're having about do you yeah okay okay pretty sure I could ask how you know that but I don't want to know no [laughter] so\nWhen he's rolling is weird [laughter] very when when he's born I'm going to limit the amount of time in play on the computer you I I tell you the I think parents that have been raising a kid for say the last ten years maybe getting caught by surprise by how screwed up their kids are because of computers\nIt the more data that you see on this and the more that you read the more scared\nYou have to be about the use of technology on a regular basis it really got limited not just I I think for adults as well but if you're raising a child\nBecause that's where brain development is happening and everything and then you take you know said screen away from the child and then they get more and more aggressive it seems like you know they they just get more the angry when one of the big problems they're pointing out is spending so much time these kids like ten years old eight years old ... years old\nAnd they're not getting any physical exercise that into you know so that all seen the movie wall e where it's a bunch of ... around around chairs because they can't move\nFor you that I think is part of the behavioral issues do Tucker is you know if if a kid that age they have so much energy if they're not getting exercise that that can't be good to run around\nThe exercise and you know just normal socialization not you know trying to present an image on social media to all your\nFriends but actually talk to you know human beings and said yeah he like what's actually going on by the socialization\nThing is is massive because you go out to eat and you see you know some parents that ballot their kid at the table and you know the kid as his earphones and yeah and he's on that I pat I'm like well how is that socializing ... and\nAnd then you have the two parents that are sitting in looking at their phones like\nEverybody's out of their phone it's like you went out to dinner to do the same thing you would have done at home now\nAre you are just too lazy to cook yeah too busy playing with your phone to cook ... coming up we're going
