R. K. O. knew the death toll from one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever hit the U.S continues to climb NBC meteorologist bill parents has the latest\nWe just got an update from the state police in Virginia for additional Faye tallies from Michael from flash flooding yesterday that brings a death toll up to eleven\nThat along with that you've got these emerging economies better slowing down significantly and that's going to have an impact on the U.S with how tied in all of the supply chains aren't how tied in\nThe world economy is now so those things aren't going away and those are things that are going to be concerns heading into Nineteen but I think that the fed can mitigate it in the short term just by saying hey we said this but here's what we actually match or can we do a little bit of\nInterest rates went to one and why this all matters because it's not\nIt's not so intuitive it's not like a bank's went out of business and so the stock market's crashing when interest rates go up specifically the ten year treasury that is what you consider to be your risk free rate and so here is how I tend to explain it to folks which is\nAs investors were making decisions every day\nWe're saying if you're investing in the stock market you're saying I Believe that the stock market is going and going to go up and it's going to go up more than the risk free rate that I can get on my money which these days with a ten year treasury it's about three point two percent so you're saying hey I think that stocks over the long term are going to beat out\nMy risk free rate on treasuries\nAs that number gets higher it's tougher to justify\nSo why do you they you know the thirty five year old who is still working and saying yeah\nCare about the short term long term I'm sure it'll I'd beat out the risk free rates says yeah still invest in stocks well the Seventy five year old might be thinking of it differently and they might be saying yeah you know this the stock market has been pretty good to me but I can now go get a CD at my bag paying two and a half percent and that's good enough\nAnd so you've got that going on in also interest rates also changed the pricing on other assets as well in that let's say that you are Tucker and you are in the market for a home right now and you've been looking at homes over the course of the ... and he said gee\nThe thirty year a mortgage rate right now I can get a mortgage at four and a half percent which means that can buy a home where X number of dollars\nWill if interest rates go up by half a percent effectively cuts you're buying power by five percent so that the way the math works let's say that you were originally looking at properties in the two hundred thousand dollar range\nAnd all of a sudden rates go up by half\nA percent now you're kept out at a hundred and Ninety thousand it doesn't mean that your monthly payment is going to be more than one Ninety versus two hundred but it doesn't mean if you're selling a home the pool of buyers that you have might not be able to afford the way you were originally priced your homes home prices and other asset prices start to fall as a result of that\nSo the concern then is one of the major ways that we grow our economy is through consumer spending largely financed by borrowing if we can't borrow as much we can't grow the economy as much threat that's pretty much what we're looking at their so\nSorry for me a little bit technical and breaking things down to almost a dumb down inversion folks but it helps sometimes to get some context around why things seemed to be falling apart and falling apart so quickly\nThe other minor impact that may have been a factor this week that hasn't been talked about a lot is we're right in that in between stage where the quarter has ended but companies haven't yet reported earning yet so most of them don't do stock buybacks during that period of time and I don't know how big that impact is\nBut if all the companies that are out there that have been buying back their stock put a pause on that for a few weeks because they're potentially you know insider information problems that can lead to a little bit of you know access ah down selling in that period of time does that\nWorry you in the long term if that's the case years in a short term impact so\nI look at it actually the opposite way it in it let's say that the market is being kept afloat largely by buybacks and I and I'm I'm not saying it is but let's say the hypothesized that the market was being kept afloat by buybacks okay well when the economy turns down company stopped buying back stock which means that you're going to see a steep herself so\nIt's something that concerns me from that perspective in it\nYou know everyone always points to buybacks is just hate us by ... great it's going to keep the company afloat but what if the circumstances changed so that the company can't make the buyback anymore\nI agree with you I just don't think that that is what is actually you know floating up the stock market illness I think it's just a small piece of things that might have added a little bit of extra volatility on the downside of this week\nBut I just I always look at it people say yeah this buyback we'll put a floor on the stock and they go what if the ... you know like you're assuming that the buyback is going to still be there are some news coming out of China yesterday a China posting a record trade surplus with the U.S in September largely before or the latest round of tariffs went in\nAnd really more than anything else I think the signals that a lot of companies were trying to really you know speed up delivery of goods from China to get in before the\n... yeah I mean it was an attempt by a lot of companies that were buying steel that were buying chip processors to skirt around the terrorists before they went into place or\nI Would be much more interested to see what the surplus looks like next quarter\nYeah ... I think the next couple of months are going to be pretty instructive as far as hey we kind of go back to a baseline or do we uh do we now have a new lower number\nThat we are going to see in terms of Chinese exports going into the U.S let's take a break right now and when we come back we're going to be joined by miles oh the one from Yahoo Finance here to get a market update on where things are going as we continue through friday that's right after this break on the financial exchange radio network\nSexy were buried to six three five six six and let us know where do you think about the stories we discuss your tuned to the financial exchange radio network\nMany of you listening today are most likely nearing retirement age and if you haven't thought deeply about planning for your retirement type ... as a method for you that will help you through the process many of you listen to talk on for years on the legal exchange radio program know that he's an expert an elder law in a state planning\nSo if you're just starting or into the retirement process you're going to have your trust documents to be prepared properly so that your assets are protected from the nursing home\nIt takes five years to secure the protection and you need to make sure that you aren't wasting your time and your money on legal documents that don't work\nThis month Todd has written a brand new guy called designing the income only a rabbit couple trust that contains the specific language that must be included and more importantly language that must be avoided and your trust in order to protect your assets from a nursing home\nYours for free by calling eight six six eight forty five six nine nine eight six six eight forty five six nine nine don't delay getting your guide today at eight six six eight for a five six nine nine or downloaded right now from our website legal exchange showed ...\nPercent of all those jobs have it all the stories on deadly Veasey news radio ten thirty Kavanaugh's demeanor yesterday Sherry ... times ... times for showing anger talk about the way here traffic on the voice of Boston\nFrom ... lady right now are they are now interviewing all of the witnesses of Christine Ford\nVicious Republicans not only get the full story on ... radio ten thirty how come out of here I Am six eighty\nW.

Y. R. E. this was the one that was supposed to be on a remote island in the Bahamas that was supposed to be a really exclusive festival and it costs like thousands of dollars to get there because you were supposed to have like a private cabana and they were the food was supposed to be professionally catered\nAnd it turned out that they had like ... houses and literally cheese sandwiches they they just did not plan to sing at all I remember those so it it it turned out that the guy running at this guy William McFarland\nPretty much made the entire thing up and had no idea how to put any of this on and so he sold a effectively he defrauded investors of twenty six million dollars twenty ... twenty six million dollars\nAnd so this morning or he has put guilty and is sentenced to six years in jail as a result of a wire fraud and bank fraud that's a long time I only did was rip off a bunch of millionaires or so up to the charge that actually got him in this case\nUm was she wrote a check using the name and account number of one of his employees without authorization that we do it will get you just about every time they also do it I Would imagine he's not actually going to serve all six years that imagines probably in for two to four\nUm but you know obviously this is one of those cases where it does appear the justice has been served here\nIn this case I mean what I mean it was twenty six years old but just a dummy move it is not good and uh I I don't know if people ended up getting any money back who actually tried to go [laughter] so under the radar yesterday\nA there was a fairly big bill that was signed by the president uh with regards to music copyright uh in giving or just a little bit more protection or as we continue to make deeper inroads into the streaming age as that becomes the primary way that people access\nMusic what can you tell us about this Mike\nSo there are a number of just strange loopholes that are being closed here a there's a small random things which seems that um first streams songs that were created before Nineteen Seventy two artist weren't receiving royalties ... which is just bury you know just random and strange so that's been cleared up\nUh there's also it seems like it's also lowering the\nBarriers to entry for somebody knew to get into the streaming game because it allows you immediate access to an entire library of songs or rather than having to go to studio studio or so it basically could say you know more competitors could jump into this a lot easier than the apple ... that are already out\nThere and I think the the big thing here is\nIt eliminates some of the middlemen who may have been able to get in and previously take a cut of this without actually doing anything this allows the artist interface directly with\nUh the publishers here so that you don't necessarily have a middleman the setting prices and so forth so I have long been someone who has said that a lot of musicians in the streaming model under compensated and under protected\nThis is not a perfect bill that signed but it gives them a whole bunch of benefits that they didn't have previously and you have all kinds of artist who have come out in favor of this bill this is a pretty big one\nIt's important to the report on because it's one of\nNo maybe two bills that I can think of in the last two years that saw wide bipartisan support so that means that it was still pretty just needed to be done\nYou know this is a bill that had been introduced I think back in April so took about six months or to to get to the point where it was passed it was passed by the way when we talk about bipartisan support\nFour hundred and Fifteen to zero in the house and unanimously in the Senate so again this is not something where you had people on opposite sides that was pretty much hey this is something that needs to get done here\nIt's somewhat encouraging that you know they're still something that we can all agree on\nThe uh the funny thing that you you have here on this um is the original sponsor of the bill a is Senator Orrin hatch um and the the idea of Orrin Hatch being the savior of music is a little bit funny you like it just it's not the person that you would expect\nI Would more expect him to be you know the bad guy from footloose ... it's not\nJust comes through on this one in knock this one out of the park so really good news for artist cheering again this bill originally sponsored by Bob good a lot in the house and Orrin Hatch in the Senate and getting through a with unanimous support in both houses here\nBMW is going to be buying out a majority stake in their Chinese a division previously they only on twenty five percent of the joint venture they held over in China is going to be helping that Seventy five percent\nYeah and this is all just based on the laws that were in place and are now changing in China so BMW it sounds like it was only allowed to own a twenty five percent venture in their\nChinese division and based on the new rules that were going to play some twenty twenty two they're allowed to acquire the majority stake of this joint venture now they still need to have a partnership with the Chinese entity up but there are allowed to own more but you're going to see more of this\nSo it's a I guess and encouraging changing some Chinese policy but it's still to me

American advisors incorporated very Armstrong representative Armstrong advisory group and the securities American companies are unaffiliated\nVoice of Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station [noise] American\nIt could then fall in additional ten percent\nHit its breakers again and then continue to fall to get to twenty two when does it closed for the day isn't there a circuit breaker that kicks into my on now like I Know there might be now there's there's which to be honest I don't think there should be but just because it doesn't do any now it doesn't um but I you might be right on that I I Can't remember the specifics there just because we haven't seen triggered\nUm if you go back to October twenty eighth Nineteen twenty nine again October kind of a trend here okay kicked off really be the great depression\nOr with the wall street crash kicking off on the twenty eighth twelve point eight two percent so that would be somewhere in the ballpark of around twenty eight hundred points right now and you continue down the list\nYou know it would be we're talking thousands of points here ... we saw five hundred yesterday we saw eight hundred of the day before it's not a whole lot of fun even if you combine those two days into one which doesn't make sense because there are two separate days it still doesn't even get\nInto your ... your twenty worst days in doubt Jones history\nIt's the problems we love talking about the points to\nThe point some of the doubt it's irrelevant percentages on these things that really are a relevant factor here and yeah I mean you know a couple of percent has nothing to sneeze at but it's not a huge deal a significant amount\nOr the ... the a circuit breakers by the way if you're a C a seven percent decline\nThat is a Fifteen minute halt Thirteen percent decline is another Fifteen minute halt and if you see a twenty percent declined to any time during the day trading shell halt for the remainder of the trading day so not really that possible to have a twenty percent plus market decline these days\nIf you want to talk about volatility by the way we look at what happened in October of twenty nine okay\nOn ten twenty eight on October twenty eighth of Nineteen twenty nine markets fell Thirteen percent the next day you sit there and you say oh gee maybe we'll get a relief rally nope down in additional twelve percent okay so you're pretty much down twenty percent in those two days\nThe following day on the thirtieth bounces back up to twelve percent okay and then five or six days later on the ... of November back down in additional ten percent so like you you talked about what we're seeing now\nI get it it's so uncomfortable if don't comfortable for every one this is all happened before and it's all been way worse ship so\nTake heart in that but hey we've gotten through things that are worse will get through this we will okay let's talk about some good news for Social Security recipients getting a to point eight percent boost the Social Security administration announcing yesterday\nBased on the average benefit people receive it's going to be about forty dollars more a month in Americans pocket\nSend the really good news so the last time we talked about this uh was last year and there was a pretty big Social Security boost last year to the problem was it got eaten up by everyone's Medicare premiums that does not appear to be happening this time Medicare costs are expected to stay in check this year a\nPart B coverage which covers doctor visits other types of outpatient care is expected to increase between a dollar fifty and hundred thirty five which is an ex credibly wide range but they're not no I went down to one thirty five right yeah that's not a range oh sorry about one thirty four right now I got it yeah\nI'm poorly written growing up uh fifty a buck fifty to one thirty five exactly so it's not a huge inflation in the health care costs are surprisingly this year so you're going to really see most of that increase in Social Security which is a nice surprise\nYeah and so again you know for I I Know that sometimes we look at forty dollars and say gee what's that mean for someone for the people who are living just on Social Security which again it's a lot of people I think it's close to forty percent of people\nLive only off their Social Security benefit once they're retired so it's a big chunk of the population\nThat forty dollars a month is real money you know it is something significant okay\nAnd so if it shouldn't be pooh poohed I Know people say oh gee it's only two point eight percent forty dollars a month is real money to a lot of people hear\nIt you know if the difference between being able to pay in some cases for you know certain prescriptions that you may have the ability to you know around the holidays go out and buy a present for a niece and nephew at Grand center a granddaughter is someone like that\nSo it's important to see this it's been really tough the last few years when we take a look at Social Security or the Cole is the cost of living adjustment is what they call it\nUm effectively it really has not been significant in recent years the last time that we saw an adjustment this big was two thousand eleven\nAnd the only times we've always seen it twice in the last decade north of two point eight percent other than that it's been all two percent or below so this is big for the for a lot of folks who are living on a fixed income because I Know that\nYou know we look at the inflation numbers that are out there and say oh gee you know inflation's pretty tame\nHey if you're on a fixed budget you know the inflationary cost probably are higher than what the government tells you because of the way that they measured the easy to forget\nHow rampant inflation was back in the late seventies and eighties and Seventy nine and ten percent cola increase right in eighty fourteen percent Ninety eighty one eleven percent that is just crazy\nSo Google a revealing a whole bunch of new devices or with their latest uh you know roll out of uh these different uh you know\nWhat what would you come smart devices I guess for Google smart devices they also about their\nNew version of their pixel phone or so it was a bit of a combination of different products for them uh and this is right on the heels of Facebook's owns smart home product which at least from people that I've talked to has been a big flop and bad timing for the company I'm Google made a pretty smart decision I think with one of their smart home\nProducts what they do ... what what are they talking about doing here so Facebook let's start with what Facebook did which is they put a almost like an eye\nPatch type device that uh you can do video chats with within your home and it runs on the Amazon or Alexa smart home device\nGoogle has put out a new product which it looks like it's again it's another smart home product it's using the Google smart devise a but it's mainly use for watching video not performing video calls\nAnd the thing that they I think addressed properly is the creepy factor they said you know was what I big hang up on the right ... hey were brand new to this industry people are still getting over the fact that there is a speaker in their home listening to them\nThey probably don't want a video camera watching them at the same time so\nThey admitted a camera on their version of this you can't do video conferencing with it but I think that's you know for somebody that's looking for this maybe they're just looking to be able to watch a quick video and how to cook something\nI I think it's a smart move at least for their first at a ration of this\nAre good we're going to take a quick break but we've got trivia when we come back and make sure you stick around get your cell phone's ready to text in because we are going to be

well gee I Need three thousand dollars a month I Need to design and develop income from my portfolio how does one do that in today's market Chuck when interest rates are so low\nWell it really is a challenge because you don't have the fixed income options that we used to CD bonds that were yielding five six seven percent there is not here anymore and one of the treasury\nLike three ten right and what are the real challenges I think is being able to keep up with inflation if you're in instruments that are only yielding two or three percent and so the conventional wisdom is hey you take your age detracted from a hundred and that's how much equity exposure you should have I don't know if it necessarily holds true for\nEvery one today simply because if you're in a portfolio that sixty or Seventy percent bonds I think you might struggle with keeping up with inflation over the next couple of decades\nOn the line or if it's just a recording which is Ninety nine percent of these calls

going to happen and\nFrankly economists aren't always write a Seventy percent of them said that they don't expect to big changes in the U.S economy [laughter] I'm among them I don't think that the new the written NAFTA deal is all that big of a change so I wouldn't expect a huge impact the economy either\nA but you know I think there are parts of it there were largely good for the U.S economy and
