R. kale I started out absolutely rep and Tom Menino and Tom Menino and I were not friends in any way shape or form\nA at the time of his death ... and I were very good friends and is there of climate and your enemies are your enemies and you must scorched them or whatever that guy and I who had very little in common politically got along fantastically that did it can happen and it needs to happen more\nIt did with me and him so I remember in four years later [laughter]\nWell I remember him say too because I Love to mayor Menino and key and I were good friends too and he was very good to me through the years and did a lot of things for me that had nothing to do with politics and had nothing to do with my profession [noise]\nAnd uh I appreciated that so often and all of his wife as well and still do lovely woman met all of his family and his kids in just a\nA a great group so uh you're right ah it it is hard to believe that's been for years already wow a\nGym what are you got going over there and my friends are well we've been hearing a lot about the ballot initiatives here in Massachusetts but there's one in California that apparently may cause a bit of a national\nStir okay just read about it is proposition twelve in California which is strengthening their cage free meat and eggs initiative that they did a couple of years ago but this apparently farmers found a loophole to kind of get around it but if this passes\nIt will officially make it so that any any animal raised in California or any meat or eggs sold in California have to come from cage free farms [noise]\nWhich is huge ban California is the single largest yeah more than that it's going to have support enough to get a ... I haven't seen any polling on it but I Do know that the U.S on twelve campaign has six point one million dollars to spend and they stopped the rotten egg initiative as five hundred thousand\nSo based on how if you said it's just so money based on your own one and no one wanted here in Massachusetts when you see you know six times more often than the other one that has\nTo move the needle yeah for sure for sure [noise]\nInteresting when we got to keep an eye on that [noise] uh mine is my last word comes from the general manager of Cabot candy which it down in province town if you want to be that house the one that all the kids make up the line too because you'd give out the best candy here\nAre the suggestions this year for Halloween\nPucker up shower candies have a movement going so keep in mind you want to give out sour nerd sweet tarts warheads and sour patch kids\nBe sure that you can go for the dark chocolate versus milk chocolate this year that includes received dark peanut butter cops mounds bars and dumped chocolate\nGet your Neko products while you still can because kids still do love to sweethearts and the clerk bars they're still out there and you can get them and finally be conscious when it comes to allergies and they find the biggest allergy is not a peanut allergy but his instead someone who has to have gluten free candy\nAnd they give examples of what you can give out for example on the joys Reese's peanut butter cops jelly belly payday snow capped and laughing taffy so if you want to be the house the kids love and oh by the way he says may get the king size\n... absolutely I Can't believe it was going to be our last year didn't mecca waivers crazy socks\nMarina what do you have to I have the top of course I knew the ... had a Halloween costumes that he has it in Eighteen can you guess what people are dressing up there at that what the most sold on Amazon are like the top ten [noise]\nBarks Kavanaugh or something maybe\nThat at school but now that would be\nThat would be creative [laughter] I don't\nKnow lay it on a hot dog though are doing that thing still\nThis is right up my alley I should address my job is this\nA unicorn they have the unicorn costumes for dollars they do\nWhich is adorable and you see it uh that's one of them dinosaurs another one but a dinosaur costume to lie in costumes jail you know he sees the\nMe and that goes over the cat or the dog and makes them look past which are cute yeah those are waking cute I'm Wonder Woman a minion then you've got an email and see the\nFull top ten nine I W archaea dot com that those are some of the popular why do I love the penguin yes yes [laughter]\nSo many different ... he'd have one or\nDid you pick ones where you know I did it or not going to do with this year leaving behind I I might have to do it today if I'm gonna do it I'm going to have all no kidding it is ... right now you have a rational dogs in lightning ran over him in the competition all I don't know\nI don't think so it wouldn't have vases law I'm the I'm going to veto dogs in the studio you know put them in the studio I drew and bring them into Denver the competition you know\nI I'm an that'd be too much but yeah you can look at our website for the rest of our right well in the meantime everybody a it's a busy day\nUh in Pittsburgh certainly and we'll keep an eye on what happens there will talk about a skinny Memorial Day and have a great day [noise]\nVoice of Boston New York about one hundred point seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station\nAnd on top of that absolutely they're doing what you're saying which is doing all the right things to expand that business to protect that business and become a presence on line but at the same time you have ... defense of stocks like Philip Morris that are doing very very well your other defensive stocks\nThat are doing very well so there's a little bit of a flight to safety here a little bit of a natural correction\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of concern to your point\nAbout the impact of tariffs ... in in what that's going to mean the bottom lines and you know when you have your United Technologies which of course as a\nAs a strong the wing when presidents they come out and say that uh it's going to have a dramatic impact on their costs and it's going to hurt the profitability and the the statistic that really concerns me the most buried in terms of the fundamental things that matter here not just the rotation from high priced thoughts that that's just nature\nWhat concerns me fundamentally is when I heard a CNBC Stuart survey that said one third of the companies that they talk to are looking at reducing research and development\nBecause of the money drain the extra cost from the tariffs now so here's a ... it seems to defeat the purpose of giving them tax breaks\nThe a lot of the rate is now going to pay for higher input cost\nSo ... and that's your criticism of the terrorists I think ... you have to recognize so John that\nWe're in a trade war and it's not in the key word there is not trade it's war and ... you know you've got an opponent\nIn the Chinese who has no integrity no morality no respect for intellectual property and they simply they take whatever is not tied down and that's that's the way they act culturally that is the way they feel towards American products they are\nA hundred thousand into something like that and you say send me the day because you take the dip it in cash right you don't have to reinvest correct you take the dividend cash and they're going to send you a thousand bucks every quarter\n... again ... ... am I going to look stupid at six months I was much but but yeah hunters could go to eighty but you're still going to get your four grand exactly and remember this to folks about dividends these companies on average pay\n... pay outrageous fifty percent ... that means they're making twice as much money as they need to afford the evidence and companies are very reluctant to cut dividend ... despite will\nBecome later with each other and not one\nBut generally most years they go up and I generally tend to knock it cuts so I I see opportunity and the other thing is the market is cheap but right now as we speak the market is at fourteen point eight times earnings yeah that is not a lot of\nYeah but to your point earlier if these terrorists screw earnings that were you know how reliable is that ... and that's why\nAnd that's why we're going maybe a little bit lower than we should but the market is up today by the way folks yep ...\nHundred and Ninety seven it's ... it's a weird day though he has futures are positive then they market opened up negative now the future and now the market's up two hundred points the\nPresident made a comment overnight but he looks forward to doing a good trade deals\nAnd wish Chinese shut up [laughter] oh he's doing is stupid mistake he made yesterday well I'm just I'm just reporting the facts and the the the Chinese took that is a very positive statement and I'll tell you something the common belief here\nIs that the Chinese are going to do a darn thing before election day to make him look good and that may be come the end of November ... with all this stuff going on we could ever breakthrough if there is watch out ten percent of the market\n[laughter] I'm trying to make them feel good you are from your lips to God's Ears\nRising national debt is going to affect voters mid term election decision a poll finds she bought in that\nUm

New York about one hundred and twenty seven till you see a like a C to Boston and I are radio station\nFor I don't know Fifteen Years from now if the supply and demand you talk to any you talk to our advertisers any of our advertisers I've talked to a gym Pluto from one of our affiliates he said Perry\nHalf of the ads I read now are employers looking for workers yeah and you think about when you listen to the radio yeah but you hear a lot of lot of ads and and you know this is not a bad place to be it's been a long time\nSince our biggest concern was the economy seems almost too hot to be able to sustain and you might laugh when I say it's too strong\nBut a reflection of the fact that we might not be able to handle the degree of the economy is the fact that we don't have enough employ in wars employees in front of a friend of mine who's ... at a very good economist\nOr told me years ago he said berry you get into the\nTwenty twenties and you're going to be reading about massive worker shortages unlike anything you've ever seen before a lot of it do to birth rate you know the earth rate declined in two thousand seven never came back\nUntil very very recently and there's another that old on ... last year it was another bad year for babies\nI read anecdotally that that there's this year's going to be a good one the last three or four months and there's actually been quite a spike in the birth rate how either I Know that's not Tucker where to go baby I I Wonder is contributing he's here to get this kid out of the ... by December thirty first better\nAs they do dates is twenty fourth yeah I could touch and go yeah I Know about your own twenty four the about twenty eight now but that tax deduction yeah exactly [laughter]\nBut that's another factor for the economy is is may be that long awaited jumping the birth rate if it doesn't help us for Eighteen years [laughter]\nWell they still buy stuff I mean there's there's there's a better that also but we need workers John I Know I Want to retire for work or you want to retire at ... yeah Johns one week away from retirement by the way out as you put that out there now I I John mood is last show his last day of work is in one week [laughter]\nAnd I'm so envious what will know you have to deal with a massive labor shortage you can't get help you\nDeal with millennials me when you retire means I have to spend more time with millennials who I still don't understand you're going to have to come to grips with your actual age which is actually old I Am because I think when when I leave just what you are the old guy and it's not even close [laughter]\nSo you have to deal with the fact that there's a labor shortage means I'm pretty much irreplaceable yes but the fact that you are an old guy I'm I'm okay with that I kind of like when you're dealing with us yeah I think you need a vacation I I think I'll take one of the south [laughter] if they are okay\nA Costco you if you want bargains I Love ... I Love Costco and I'll be just two of my favorite shopping destinations yup Cosco is are there Black Friday is is you don't ironically it's on a friday I I I thought we were not doing this story so I got really they they normally open their stores\nYet at ten of them they're going to open up on a November twenty third at nine AM\nAnd you know this is a game that it's gotten more competitive and less competitive bending of how you look at in a there was that rush to get everybody to work on Thursday and people got really mad at that\nCompany started to realize hey we're we're going to we can push a lot of our business online do the same sales have people not have to wait in long lines have people not killing each other in long lines right and at the same business and give our employees a break right so that's kind of will really wants to work on Thanksgiving you know in an online world it seems like abuse now\nWhat if I don't have to be there why am I there and then all kinds of awful things are happening yeah right\nPeople killing each other to get the big screen TV yeah like that wasn't good enough no you know in in the previous hour I I said I Wish the president periodically would just shut up shut the hell up Mr President\nYesterday that the market took a tumble ... based on his comments regarding tariffs\nYeah I saw it hit the tape and he said that do we're just going to put terrorists and everything yeah and we're we're looking at about ... and that's when we went down five hundred points right up market was started the day up to fifty was down to close to an changed the midday and then it just went into freefall after that\nEvent John Mooney this morning comes in and says it's OK buried silken 'cause you just said that he thinks he's going to what he did he think now today what what time is is he may have changed his mind but she said oh we're going to get a great deal out of China he he mentioned overnight and the only reason I mentioned this is a big deal is because the\nThe Chinese market reacted very favorably this look we're just grasping at straws here you know there's a lot of back and forth there was a threat yesterday that just sunk the market overnight I think Trump ... maybe should have said that it but that's why he should shut [laughter]\nYeah well you know the markets are going up and down based on a tweet about the border fine right shut up about the market and the tariffs\nWell we have an ongoing negotiation in a in a war of words ... with a she is in China\nI your bottom line here is the Chinese are going to do nothing between now and next Tuesday to make Donald Trump look good he should understand that they're not going to do that how bad is it going to be next Tuesday a I've got how much how much power the socialists going [laughter]\nI've got the Democrats picking up thirty five seats and I in this in the house I've got the Republicans picking up to in the Senate and that gets us to a place where we were the last two years of Obama where gridlock\nYeah you're going to have a government by executive order I think you'll see reduced um you know you see some stuff in the regulations run reduced more more you know and then you'll deal with issues like a possible Supreme Court nominees and the Democrats will simply a\nBring up investigations into who was doing what what is time freshmen in college and\nSaid bad stuff and let's look at it so yeah\nBut they won't have the power to do anything and the Republicans won't have all that much power to initiate much legislation so I think we're looking at\nGridlock American tech firms are winning the research and development spending race with China what does that mean to you it's more important than you might think that's our next topic on the

shows just punch up that lists financial exchange showed dot com [noise]\n\nSeventy percent of American companies operating in southern China are considering delaying further investments there and moving some\nFor all of their manufacturing to other countries as the trade war bites into profits this according to a business survey that was done John this is really the nightmare scenario for China this is why their economy is crumbling this is why their currencies devaluing\nAnd this is why their stock market's down dramatically here today this is yet another example of them arguably the most glaring example of why this really could hurt China a lot of when you start seeing this this really does bite into their economy so what we're seeing as we're seeing collateral damage on both sides\nClearly China has more to lose than we do a which is adding some urgency\nClearly there markets have reacted even more adversely than our markets although our markets are starting to do poorly this month or so these are the stakes were experiencing is nothing compared to the Chinese John absolutely uh you know the impact of this for the United states will be\nPretty small now um it it it may have an inflationary impact it may make us a little bit more insular in terms of how we deal may hurt your four one K. you may look at your portfolio you may get your brokerage account statement for the next year or two\nAnd say gee I haven't made a darn nickel and that's that's a cost of doing business but the problem is you have to you have to fight them and and it's it's not an easy thing to fight because people say well my TV I used to be able to buy TV for four hundred dollars that's cost six hundred dollars well tough\nYeah I mean this is this is the the negative of what's happening but this is the new reality that were in these are the consequences that are\nThat we have for what is essentially a trade war and in China has a lot more to lose in the United states\nI I Do think this is setting up to some sort of negotiation to come to agreement on on some of these key issues\nThere's just too much at stake and also from the perspective of the United states you know the problem I Would like to agree with you I like I I've been wrong so I Would love to agree with you but they they are cultural feeds I mean if if you can green in their culture to steal\nAnd this is a separate issue and we have to get the shot is the issue but there's other issues with respect to products that we make and manufacture and sell\nAnd other products that they make in manufacturing so that we can come to some sort of agreement I mean I'm not sure we can why should Boeing has to pay for an issue that has to do with apple I mean it comes down to I mean I I Know what you're saying I I feel like we can address both\nYou know I'm not sure we can get I'm losing okay because I don't trust them John on anything I don't trust them as far as I can throw them is just like I don't trust the Saudis yeah ... if this was the case we're gonna have\nTo really rely on domestic consumption and the consumption of allies that we're going to have a new world where where I work at a drill instead of China they I mean that that right ... you're going to see companies move their manufacturing out of China and once they moved back going back\nAnd and the problem in the mean in in the near term is that we have American companies are really good bet the farm on growth in China\nAnd we talked about John talking about your Starbucks and your General Motors yeah I mean General Motors sells more cars in China than the United states if\nUh you know they stole a lot of cars they make a lot of money about whether the business is much more profitable the United states but they're ... story is there were there were more people and just going to be a lot more people in the next the next twenty thirty a hundred years\nIt's a new world and and and the the rules are changing and I agree with you a hundred percent that they're not playing by the rules and they never have and they and their culturally John it's just different\nLike they'll enter into a contract with an American company and then just not honored right right and then you sue them you get a judgment in New York or you get a judgment in in superior court\nAnd you're owed fifty million dollars they sue you in China right and get an equal judgment in a corrupt legal system for fifty million dollars and they don't pay you they say well we got the ... yeah you have a fifty million dollar judgment against us but we've got fifty million judgment against you in China and my ... my favorite stories you're saying like\nApple's doing really well so they just create their own apple stores yeah and they say where they just knock it off they knock off the sign they knock off a name\nLook at both yeah go to China so you have any both speakers you can buy you can get they're not made in China ... speakers ... exactly real cheap at a at a good price\nI ... I don't know what the ... and resolution is that he I did see a we're restricting Chinese ... makers from doing business with American firms that is a start us barring us U.S companies from doing business with a Chinese state owned chip maker\nThat Mike Ron has accused of stealing its secrets\nAgain this is another example of the Chinese obviously being very Overton stealing our technology and we're saying no enough is enough this is where the war is being fought and uh they're not going to be like a war there are not missiles\nAre there this is as a matter how many tanks you have any or does it you know after you got enough to do damage you got a seriously question\nArt debate about the military is going to be interesting I I think it's fascinating if have you noticed that the ... poorly they're doing yeah because I think ... hours a week there was two hundred ten bucks not long ago it's a hundred and sixty five bucks it's cratered was is that the economic warfare\nIs is John this is what is going to is no it's not the ... it's not the terms writing your defense companies are looking at it and people are looking at him saying yeah they you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Boston", "day": "30"}
