{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Of it was kind of a pre fix meal we had four choices and they brought out some appetizers ... services grace if word was delicious lives in the atmosphere was so into the movie the movie is called stiffs and uh you can\nBuy it on Amazon but he said you got to get this distributed ... is really a terrific movie that quick story line is it's about a north and or a funeral home with business isn't so good and so they start\nKilling people in order to join our allies like those I like it it's great that's great terrific uh how 'bout you Jimmy ...\nAh Yeah Yup The Simpsons have announced that they are killing off a major character\nOr they're not killing them they're just writing him out of the show\nA op who who was the ... guy um has been a bit controversial for the last couple of years people have been more and more feeling like he's more of a stereotype unless somebody\nAccurate representation of Indian people in this country there was a documentary that came out about it last year where they basically flat out said there's a problem with this character and the guy who voice the character came out and said yeah I kind of get we're talking about I'm not super comfortable with this any more either\nSo now they're just dropping him from the show so they're just not going to the Mardi Gras anymore or wherever they attempted last year last season to take it had on by actually having one of the character's make mention of it\nAnd kind of calling out the fact that this was a character that was beloved for years and now all of a sudden something's changed and now\nPeople have a problem with them but they are now given up and they're just letting the character fade away you know I don't watch that show I didn't want five years I watched it when it first came out\nYeah but yeah I don't know if I wouldn't know anything about this ... absolutely love the show ... yeah I I really I really am not can I'm certainly not criticizing anybody for this but I think some people don't know the ...\nThose are characters are it's a cartoon character is a huge raising hey\nLet me just tell you this very quickly this is not a cartoon character this is an unbelievable story we didn't get to this this morning but after we left here on friday Megan Kelly was let go from NBC ...\nAnd uh they have worked out some kind of exit strategy that has not really been announced but I guess she it sounds like she got most of her money and she was asked to go\nSo uh the show debuted again this morning I don't know if you know this but you know she's got that extra hour of the today show now does it make and Kevin Kelly show but with its replacement and its genna Bush wow oh it's a little loving she'd\nSitting there next to Megan ... last week\nShe was then that's kind of a permanent thing there was this looks like it I think they're going to at least run it for a while and see how it goes so as of now she Megan Kelly is replaced by genna Bush shaker\nUm Craig Melvyn in al Roque or will join her to help post and the way she goes I Wonder if you can hold her cousin Billy before she signed that contrary to make sure that they don't want to do was get paid like twenty million a year she yeah she it's right but\nAnd had only been there a year and a half and half of what sounded like an ironclad contract us so NBC is going to have to pay it out and\nUh but made the decision there ... you know before she made her comments last week um they were already allegedly in talks with her to find an exit strategy of the show\nWas it was a rocky relationship right from the start no doubt about it\nThen that was the the sort of the role that put her in was not her natural you know and not a lot a lot of a ... second guessing going on at NBC is the you know who thought that through and what and they think it through more careful\nI I was always under the impression that Megan Kelly thought she was going to NBC to ultimately be the today show host\nAnd when that didn't happen and the dynamic of the the today show changed [noise] um I I think then they\nThought this talk show format would be okay but Megan Kelly with somebody who needed to stay in a harder news uh atmosphere where he's not a warm and fuzzy person and and news was hurting\nSo whether she pops up again somewhere I don't know if you a gym we talked about this on friday you know could you possibly pop up on Fox News again I don't know if you've heard this but executives at Fox News said we're very happy with our current lineup\nLike I Can't imagine that show the you know she was she when she was leaving she was very much a free agent you don't want to go to different places and Fox games nothing but bringing her but for some\nTough deal but interesting to watch this but this sometimes people can make a real moving this business by someone else's mistaken this may have been someone else's mistake that ultimately open the door for genna Bush will see see how that's going down right will\nBe interesting yeah it really well you know again you see some of these newcomers to the big stage some of them hit the ground running right away others you know he's got to work out a\nMurray days got this morning yeah this one is a V. d.s alley for sure I got to tell them about this one so there's a pop up restaurant that happened in Tokyo, Japan and the restaurant created a menu based off those last meals requested by famous death row inmate\nCan you believe that this is not the bees alley like I thought that's another thing I immediately thought of him\nAnd I'll give you an example for instance a so one of the death row inmates at the very famous Gary mark Gilmore requested a hamburger baked potato hard boiled egg and three jak Daniel shots so this restaurant had that exact meal you're like ... I Want to order\nWhat are the double murderer Gary mark Gilmore ordered isn't that ridiculous\nSo the meals are actually served as they were serving you them or not like you can order something off of their their last menu you actually get served their last meal\nYup exactly same with that there was another one that they called I guess the the murder where the black widow she wanted asparagus broccoli and tomatoes and strawberries just completely random\nSo there's a vegetarian meal they serve on their menu yup there's that one you are so right the VP would love oh because he loves um he's fascinated by you know research on like serial killers and they're going to any less food mhm so the combination of the do the right of up as I got hooked on this to him you have one more\nYeah there's one more is that uh I Believe John Wayne that gay see if I'm pronouncing his last night\nHe ordered the bucket of KFC French fries a pound of strawberries in fried shrimp\nAnd so they started ... fried chicken I guess probably right they say a bucket at KFC so I don't they must I mean that they probably can't the over there and Japan I'm sure they do yeah that's what they ... that is kind of weird though in terms of yeah copyright issues and I don't know how they serve that but\nI think it's it's a pop up restaurant I paid a visit with permanent Russia that would be that would be a good American style fried chicken\n... eat like the murderer eat like a murderer who who wouldn't want to write always looking for that next card so that goes\nTo raise the money and get one popped up over here somewhere when he was doing research\n... as they do a lot has been with us this morning we're very thankful thank you serve in ground a huge him yeah I think you great to have you here and

cable news Pittsburgh is in mourning following the deadly shooting at a synagogue Jeffrey Myers is the rabbi at the tree of life synagogue were eleven people were killed Saturday he delivered a powerful message yesterday as he addressed a crowd around two thousand\nI thought to myself to twenty third some\nDelivers my shepherd I shall not want\nWell God I Want what I Want you can give me you can't return\nLittle lightning in a bottle you know let me ask you this would it be\nA better league would there be more interested in baseball if there was a hard cap like there is an hockey basketball and football\nNo it's not you don't need it in baseball because one player can't transformed the sport that can't transform a team the way they can in in basketball as an example\nHockey is a team sport\nAnd ... and ultimate team sport you know you have a great quarterback but a terrible defense you not winning anything I disagree in football football you have a great quarterback you can hide a lot of things to look at look at the patriots last year yeah that was a God awful or just look across the board the NFL and we have all the poor quarterbacking right now yeah yeah it's\n... basically I still think a salary cap is an influence things I Know the just the issue in terms of our games yeah in terms of interest now not a factor whatsoever ... interesting uh IBM i got news of this last night to sit and actually with my son were having dinner\nAnd I asked him I said you see that IBM's bought red hat\nAnd he was shocked when I told them how much they were paying for the company a hundred and Ninety dollars a share\nYeah this is effectively and in mission by IBM in a very expensive admission that what they've tried to do over the last decade hasn't worked that's ... that's the message that I take from this because\nRed hat was a company that was valued somewhere around Eighteen billion dollars that was training about six times sales they paid eleven times sales for this company and read have pretty much what they do their their cloud computing company\nThat focuses on you know winning development\nAnd this is pretty much their mission from I've yeah it's a\nNew company it's not like it's what twenty five years old something like that it's not like\nYeah it was it I mean twenty five is you know I guess I mean I Know it's not a new government but you know this is a company that you know in IBM that pretty much in doing this is admitting nothing that we're doing on the cloud side is working and so we just need to spend a boatload of money and hope that this works out my\nMy impression of the deal and I'm not a technology guy but it's like a Hail Mary on the part of Geneva comedy you know she's a failed CEO right she's been there six years stock has been just miserable has pretty much the mission that she did fail and uh she survive\nThey give imagine if this because the the impression I have is they paid too much I again I could be wrong but if if this goes south and if this doesn't have a major impact like how long does she have to make this deal work year two years three years\nSo IBM as as a result of making this deal has said they've suspended their share buybacks for the next two years in order to clean things up from a cash flow perspective and need the money for this is a big cash deal so we're doing I I look at this and in theory you've got to give her at least to the end of that just because you know that's where you're going to potentially see ... what happens there but\nI mean you will get all the deals of decide that have happened if the size that have happened in tech they generally\nDon't work out what um when when you look at this deal that thirty four billion dollar price tag um do ... if you're a shareholder in red hat\nAnd you say why don't want to take the hundred and Ninety dollars you don't really have any choice do why would you not want to take the one nine to ... you know just to say you think it's worth I don't know two ten or something you want to ...\nAll you can really do is vote against you have to take the cash maybe there's a X. reason you don't want to do it yeah you have no chance your your your ... that cat that deal that money's going to show up in your brokerage account whether you want to know how long does it take a deal like this because I saw in\n... let's say I owned a thousand shares a red hat right\nAnd it's going to close is it is a year end is it to one is a cute to some of these deals take a long time and it and some of them get need government approval\nFor what they're guiding to on this is that is going to take somewhere between six and nine months for this deal to actually close so it's not a tax\nIssue for this you know it is likely going to end up being somewhere I Would get in the second quarter early third quarter next year is where you see this close to late spring early summer is is kind of what you're seeing a for when this closes but\nI'll tell you if if I'd be him get this one wrong ... they're not out of business because companies that big don't go out of business but they're going to be in a case where they're digging out for the next decade\nYou know they you know what I said to my son said this sounds like a GE type deal\nThis is something Jeff ... would have done I was going to the age of ... okay yeah that may be a better ... maybe a better comparison because of the the tech a relationship but we'll see you you know it's easy to a to point fingers and cast aspersions\nWe're not in the boardroom we don't have access to the financials we're just okay I just said holy smokes you're paying a hundred and Ninety bucks for a company that on friday close one eleventh\nThis this is one of those deals and and here's the other thing is you look at this and you will get kind of when they're doing this it really brings similarly to the AOL Time Warner merger you know peek value weight like it just it has all the feeling of like something that just isn't going to work\nAnd well you kinda wonder does red hat end up on top with this deal does this become a red hat culture company because redhead you will get red had success in revenue growth and share price appreciation I mean they're they're one heck of a company\nThey're still here's the thing so red had they do about that last year about two point nine billion dollars in revenue IBM did you know Ninety five billion so IBM is still you know far and away the biggest piece why understand but you look at growth well here's the thing though is in order to justify this multiple\nThey don't have to grow just you know what they've been they've got a growth through the roof and I just it's a really tough pot the spin\nOn the path of uh IBM is that this will access them two new growth categories and there'll be able to you know really improve their sales I you know I I got to tell you I think Jenny is too old to be running this company oh I disagree with that tech companies I think tech companies and the young CEOs\nI disagree with that now you know I mean look at Tim Cook Tim Cook is you know not a spring chicken these I think going to be fifty eight fifty nine you know in the next you know you're a good example you know so like I don't think you have to be in your thirties and forties yes you know well\nYou know that if any of our yeah but still he was older when he was no no he wasn't he he was a kid he started that when he was at Harvard mind\nBut I I Will get you know some of the some of the again you know I don't know if you need to be in your thirties and forties but you just need to be good and Janine ... just not appeared to be able to turn the corner\nFor the last five years we've been hearing oh we're going to be a cloud come from your cloud company and then they went out and bought a cloud company you know it's just it's an admission of failure\nAre you better off financially today than you were when the

was it didn't down to ... percent [noise]\nUh in that ballpark I Can't remember exactly what it was but somewhere went from about Eighteen hundred a shared down to you know the low sixteen about eight nine percent\nDown again today you have one percent yell at you and I looked at their numbers I said the grow it like twenty nine percent how how can you be so critical for the company has grown at twenty\nNine percent it's ... it's concern on margins in certain areas there that they had margins that held up in parts of their business but you know not the whole thing and and the problem is if your margin start to show signs of weakness you know the the very small profitability that they have becomes threatened than in particular\nOn the cloud side of things you know that's that's the question that I think they're facing is you know the cloud side of their business is facing some competition not a ton at this point they're ganging up on 'em that's relatively stable but the the big retailers on the retail side that's where you're seeing pricing pressure because targets being competitive Wal Mart's being more competitive\nLet's not only that ... the the workers are saying hey man you want me to show up and work at a warehouse which is a tough job right you you by any standard working you if you work at an Amazon warehouse your walk we're walking\nEight to ten miles a shift I

Pittsburgh area synagogue were eleven people were murdered will eventually hold services again that's the problem is being made by rabbi Jeffrey mayors he tells the today show the sanctuary was devastated by the gunfire\nWe will rebuild because we're a tree of life within your hundred and fifty four years and you can cut off some branches but [noise] the tree will continue to grow and we will be ...\nYou know how do you effectively just managed the sheer numbers of people that were going to be seen coming in there I just there is a wave coming in I don't know if we've ever had to deal with something like this ... out of this scale\nAt least I don't think we have they're expecting truck a home care is going to require one point two million additional workers on top of what they have now right and you're gonna have a lot of retirements between now and twenty twenty six one point two million needed by twenty twenty six\nAnd it doesn't ... doesn't pay well it's only like at eleven dollars an hour\nNo it it doesn't pay well and I think you know what's what's really interesting to me is the kind of look at where we've come from in kind of this in in dealing with the the problem of aging mhm 'cause this is kind of a new issue it on two fronts number one you have people living longer okay\nThat means that they you know a greater percentage of people are going to run into something that doesn't kill them but requires them to have care you know used to be if you go back to you know the forties fifties and sixties\nYou didn't have a ton of people that needed this level of care 'cause most of the time what ever happened to them usually they were dying anyways you know they didn't have\nThis level or the disability and they didn't live for ten years in that state no it's it's ... the medical advances have gotten to the point where we can keep people alive now but we don't really have a system or a way to take care of them easily\nAnd the problem I think is compounded by the fact that in today's world\nIn so many families both spouses have to work in order to make ends meet and so you end up in a situation where a family member can't be that person carrying it a lot of case\nWhat about assisted living facilities because that's a that's an alternative they you know I'm going through this with family members now where you know they're they're selling their house right and they're buying a unit in assisted living now that cost depending on where you are\nBut that's about four or five hundred thousand dollars but if you have equity in your home if you own your home outright you can afford that\nBut then you're looking at the the costs but this couple is six thousand three hundred dollars a month I really question how many retirees can afford six thousand three hundred dollars a month every month you not not that many ... they may know families don't have that much in gross income\nKnown in it's in in particular what you're going to see is you know so many people in ... really it's it's generation X and kind of the beginning part of the millennial generation are going to be in situations where they're having to care for parents yeah but also still having kids and their teams and a lot of cases\nSo what are you guys gonna do are you going to like have your folks moved in with you are you going to pay the assisted living facility yourself ... like I I mean right now I'm not joking about this this is a serious issue that millennials are going to have to take care of no way the boomers we're going to be you know we're we're going to be the ones that need taking care of\nNo idea I I have no idea how to deal\nWith no really no easy solution is there no ... if you wear how ... what do you do put them in a warehouse ...\nYou've got two options you have care for them yourself you know or spend money so if someone else cares for the rate like either way like there's no easy way to deal with\nIt because the nursing homes are closing ... we've seen a wave of nursing home closures because they're saying hey the government regulations and this is you know it's ... it's a it's a fascinating topic and I'm not an expert on it but you look\nAt the reason nursing homes are closing we you close your business because you're not making any money right right and and the government says well you must have this many nurses you must have this many doctors you must have this type of\nCare well the government regulation is driving up the cost and I understand the logic behind it right it it's kinda like daycare you get a lot of government regulation involved in daycare because a kid dies well same thing in a nursing home\nA senior citizen dies and the government feels the need to say well you must have this type of care available you must adhere to these regulations and then eventually these nursing home say\nThey would they wave the white flag they just say look we're done I talked to ... we have a client who who are used to run a health care facility and he said very you know you you have no idea what kind of merging compression we've experienced in the last Twenty years\nOn in in in looking at this overall don't get me wrong ... these are good problems to have because the the flip side of this is look if people just you know pass away than like you don't have to deal with this problem but no one wants that you don't want your loved ones just passed away it's OK we need to figure out how to care for him so it\nIt's a good problem but there's no easy answers because of how we built\nA boat the system right now that cares for people as they age\nAnd the fact that many families they can't take enough time off to care for these ... to care for a folks who need it you know in their families it's we're we're just not built in today's society to deal with these problems in that risk is going to be present whether or not we build systems to fix this or not [noise]\nAn interesting topic that
