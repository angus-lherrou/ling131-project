W. R. K. O. news hurricane Michael is now a category ... storm\nOr you know traditionally a very conservative area the stock market a grim guaranteed profits are regulated by the states say national grid paying a dividend yield right now of nearly six percent per year and dividends\nThat's pretty attractive but the tenure treacherous paying three and a quarter yeah I Wonder how big how high\nDid you see the race and need to get before investors said\nHey why am I why am I investing in these companies at the at the margin there's a little bit of a difference all the time but like your question is at what point do you crack when I go okay collectively let's get out of this stuff and let's go way to fix stuff\nUh I think that number is in the four percent four and a half percent area and you people might laugh at that but you know what in Nineteen Ninety nine last time we had a robust rock and roll stock market that\nEnded up becoming too expensive\nThe ten year treasury was six point two percent yeah\nOkay I ... and people were not buying the guaranteed six point two they all wanted those stocks right we've learned our lesson sure ah so the question now is in the real normal world what is that right probably another hundred basis points higher would be real competition for stocks some more\nExamples writer so I have a thirty year mortgage rate locked in at three point eight seven five percent okay I'm very happy with that right when I have extra money I have\nA choice I can invest that extra money or I can pay down by ... those are two of my options I could also go blow it on a National Guard but that's just not me [laughter]\nBut at three point seven five I Would rather invested in the stock market over ten year time horizon I Believe that the stock market's gonna beat out the cost of my mortgage I fight a five percent mortgage and I'd be much tougher conversation form and much more difficult a math equation\nAnd you know what the the the exercise you're doing right now is an explanation of what's going on right now with the stock market because well what you're talking about doing with your with your mortgage you know is what investors every day think about that incremental extra dollar they have to invest\nWhat do I get to safe what do I get for a risk right and in Nineteen Ninety nine they were all willing to take a risk at any cost and we learned the pain of doing that\nSure right now you're seeing you know the the the people who are very nervous because they're worried that is one of those moments I don't think we're there yet though unless we had a really large quick increase\nYou're going to still see twenty percent earnings get growth yep overwhelm these issues were talking about\nIt it's the story of a lot of different markets right you know people are worried about the real estate markets well it's slowing down that doesn't mean it's heading for a crash it just means that prices aren't continuing to grow at seven eight percent per year nationwide\nOr you know when I look at the stock market yeah I I I see some ... when I look at the U.S economy has season cracks in the foundation but\nIt doesn't mean that said you know suddenly you know suddenly publicly traded companies are just gonna start losing money hand over foot it just means that well maybe instead of earnings growth growing at twenty percent maybe it comes down to ten or Fifteen\nYears on and on top of that there there's another issue I mean you're talking about the overall market which absolutely true\nWith in the market what we've had and you can understand the complacency that happens\nIf Amazon works in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand sixteen and two thousand Seventeen investor just kind of get used to throwing their money at all the companies that worked as an investment now these are great businesses but what we're seeing happening right now is a rather dramatic rotation\nOut of that which we just got used to buying any price ... and into a lot of the really good value that exist in the stock market in places like financials and places like some of these industrial southern overlooked\nUh we're seeing some of the out of favor stocks now doing really well and some of the real high flyers coming down to earth that's a healthy correction yep yeah and we're not even there yet and we're not even there in terms of ... random image will socks we're seeing some go Jared others come back that's a nice healthy thing when you get the expensive stuff kind of coming down\nThe inexpensive stuff's going up that gets you to a more normal valuation yep so\nYes we have seen volatility yes than as act down almost four percent so far in October but still up twelve percent year to date so it you know we have to keep all of this\nAh in mind and consider the backdrop of what we're dealing with today are right now by the looks of it uh in terms of the odds it looks like they're the forty one percent probability that the fed raises rates three or more times by the end of June of twenty Nineteen\nAnd that's the big concern going forward I mean look we'll that stopped the economy no no but uh it will take out some access and we can we talk about Pina there is no alternative that's a theme that you know buried I've been talking about for years\nUp there actually is a little bit of alternative and you can now get three percent and next year if we have three increases you know you're gonna be taking a look at that mortgage or you can be looking at that you know money market account and saying you know what\nI'm not going to be in such a rush to put that money to work and my money market accounts them getting three percent right um that's a competitive return right so these ... it again to ... we should point out that the earnings are increasing at a twenty percent right there and that's very very healthy\nUm I don't want to be the dead horse on China here but let's talk about this meeting because at least from what I have seen a U.S relations with China while\nVery difficult and ed privately we talk about how bad they are but I've never really recalled a public meeting between us and Chinese officials that was this fraught with contention\nThe secretary of state Mike Pompeo exchange rather chest the words with Chinese foreign minister and he was I thought he the pump a it was actually the the ... one of the two when he was going crazy yeah [laughter] I mean they're not happy and we we understand that\nA and this is complicating other issues in terms of international relations namely the anticipated summit with North Korea yeah\nSo it's kind of a mess out there and politics is overriding this I mean they're watching our politics and we're watching their situation\nAt the ... the north Korea issue to me is the only regrettable part\nOf our current policy towards China I pretty much agree with all of the\nMaybe not the cause of you to avoid public he said about the terrorists but the fact that we implemented these terrorists in our sticking to them right now I'm generally a big supporter of because of China's actions around or\nYou know stealing proprietary information you I'm the only piece set it aside impact that is regrettable to me is North Korea so unpredictable and we might have been close to wrapping something up there but that that might really take a hit because\nOf these relations yeah I mean I ... at the same time you know we do have a good communication with the north Koreans and and really we can't trust them completely completely you can't buy you can stop war but you can't really buy these\nAre the fact the matter is that we have an improving relations with them and they can't be launching nuclear weapons while they're talking to us so that's that's the kind of good news but it's a complicated situation and my fear is that China I've heard rumors that China may be looking to the United states and saying\nYou know Trump is being so tough on us we're just going to suck it up for the next year or so and hope to get someone veteran twenty twenty\nThat's the case we could have quite a stand up I like breaking news Nikki Haley has resigned as UN ambassador according to a source on CNBC that's huge news because she is a rising star is on the national scene a and a surprising fries resignation yeah resigning as as you went to Vassar\nWhat we're

Schneider shattered ... Mr Shater\nOr who you have all seen his papa John's yeah he is he's name is John he invented the company created it he owns thirty percent of the company but he got in trouble\nBecause I think it was up on a a media call he made a third person reference to a um\nBad word racial slur racial slur ... I I don't know if it was a media conference or an internal conference call but nonetheless he was ousted because of that and that was the reason I I've heard that uh the culture papa Johns was was also part of the\nUh because I got to believe is more than him just saying I don't think it was ... Lincoln referred to so and so as being something that would make you lose your your business literally\nOut what's happening right now is to see who partners up with John who has thirty percent of the stock and what happens so that's that's where we stand right now\nAnd is considered considering a takeover of papa Johns and there's other companies also that could be in the building you know\nThey own Wendy's they own dominoes at one point you know an arby's to I Believe this would make some sense that what they haven't dealt with I haven't seen try and dealing with a company in big\nPublic turmoil before you know they haven't they haven't to address that issue of a papa John's type of scenario they haven't you know they haven't dealt with a company a lot of these companies you know CBS type of scenario where you're dealing with the c._e._o. has been who has been in the spotlight\nAnd is very polarizing they dealt with you know issues within companies about sales and profits and things like that but not a big\nI Want to start a fight type of story because of the CEOs actions\nYou know ... and this is the key point the key point is it's pizza\nAnd you can get decent pizza at a lot of different places or what differentiates you in that business is image and image alone that images tarnished\nYou're stuck with a piece of pizza that that anybody can get where ever they want a ... however they want and and the problem the question the the sixty four thousand dollar question is\nHow damage is that brand that are Johns they had a\nPretty good ad that I saw I think during the super during the football game on Sunday maybe ah with all the franchise owners lawn they they just you know had clips of ten second clips of a bunch of different franchise owners or a papa John's\nRight basically saying you know that's not us they still come to our store a ... a diverse group of people trying to really put that behind them a because that's what's hurting it yeah it's hurting the stock papa John's but it's really hurting the franchise owners\nAnd here's the thing at the end of the day we talk about your ... which is which is controversial\nBut you're totally has something kind of proprietary and they're going to have a lot of challenges no question about that but you know they can overcome it by saying we actually have different food we actually have a different presentation we actually have something you can't get out a whole lot of other places\nEvery town has like five pizza shops and so that's going to be a real challenge them but if they can come through this and they have the backing of a company that is really good at the food business and they're part of that chain you know it could work out\nYeah I mean papa Johns was the main reason that I put on Fifteen to twenty dollars so I mean I I'm a big supporter or they weren't around I was I wasn't even bigger supporter at one point you know twenty pounds bigger [laughter] but you could have been an equally twenty pounds bigger with pizza I could've\nOr does or dominoes I could've papa John's is the only one that was on the ah\nThe college meal plan so that that was\nFor me dominoes just delivered you know two thirty AM college or to that many weekends\nYeah and nothing to be proud of that is I Would take ... to ...

from the wall Street Journal the document shows Google officials felt that disclosure could have serious ramifications revealing the incident would likely result in us coming into the spotlight along side or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed on the radar throughout the Cambridge analytical scandal\nThis is so much worse yeah this is so much worse than having been alongside Facebook during that issue and think\nAbout what they're saying is Facebook has got a lot of bad publicity let's not get on the way the path of listening now let's just make sure all the bestseller list is this right under the rug is all Cambridge Analytica and all the issues Facebook has let's keep our problems quiet yep on top of the fact that the major technology companies\nWere invited to Washington to discuss issues\nAnd I you know I I'm I defend the government they kept that seat empty yup Google nobody showed up now and they won't face the music and they have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of privacy and the way in which they regulate themselves it's basically a self regulation it's like a whole different world\nYeah it's not good chief executive officer a cinder ... almost definitely going to be testifying Congress now uh now we're do doubt subpoena time exotic they're they're lucky Europeans GDP the general general data protection regulation just went into effect in may whereas this incident took place in March\nOr that new law requires companies to notify regulators breaches have been seven years you hours so if this law had been into place than Google it'd be facing a massive find from the European regulators as\nThere are kind of in a gray area now as to what's actually going to happen if there will be any fines ... probably they're going to be finds here I Will give the European regulators a lot of credit because they've been that is a good rule\nYeah it's a great role and they've been way out in front of the rest of the world when it comes to issues concerning Google ... ... and it was it a point of it you know disappointed the United states did not have a law like this on the books is\nOr the lack of regulation is really troublesome because uh there's millions and millions of people who are using these products they're following us everywhere we go they're listening to our conversations they know more about us than we think we know about ourselves on the other hand and and they and they operate independently as like don't bother us we're not accountable\nAnd and I know the argument the other hand as\nWell if you don't like it don't Senate Facebook fair but there are some services that it's really difficult to you know there's some online services is pretty difficult to not participate in for you it's tough to not have an email address these days yeah although there are ... yeah there are options though there are options that are more secure than yoga agreed but hey you still need to have data protection laws in place to protect us from\nIt's very difficult to have no on line a personality today have no online presence whatsoever is very very difficult in this day and age it's hard not to be on Facebook\n... or ...

of Facebook at least on my ... the European general data protection regulation by the way a threatens penalties up to two percent of your world or the companies worldwide revenue if they fail to adhere to these rules so I'm\nPretty stiff regulation that unfortunately was not in place when Google broke these rules\nAre so we will see what happens with school based on these results they're
