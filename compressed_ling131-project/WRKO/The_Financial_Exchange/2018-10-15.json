R. dot com or one of our news people flooded up did you hear about this with a\nGrandfather on the airplane who exposed himself and then ended up slapping a passenger and was obviously taken into custody and removed\nBut ah yeah he was walking down the aisle I Believe the plane already took off and he was walking down the aisle with his genitals expose next to this guy and his kids and family the guy got up to see something right\nLike this is outrageous you shouldn't be doing this but you know kids around and what have you or anyone around just any slapped the guy and then the the flight attendants added removing keep him I guess uh\nI don't know detained until they made a a landing but apparently he had too much wine\nNo alcohol was involved of course and um that that's the next fun to build airplanes story for everyone says it seems to be every other day we have one\nNo kidding alcohol has made numerous people\nDidn't we have a a member of the navy and he was on you know a few days off and they found that a theme park in the parking lot naked running around\nWhich is not I don't think that probably bodes well when you get back to the ship or whatever no news and he was just a theme park and they picked him up in the parking lot and he's also is resisting arrest which will also ah not vote to well you get back\nSure why it is that when people get to loaded they just feel that they need to take their clothes off or whatever reason they believe they look better naked when they're closer off I guess for when they drink too much\nIs quite shocking I couldn't imagine a on a plane like that and not happening\nI feel like everyone goes one of two ways when you're drunk you really like the way you look naked or really hate the way you look\nNow and I guess maybe that is true I guess I don't know it's true I guess it's fair well on that note I guess we'll leave it right now we've got the president had it to a this\nRavaged part of Florida and Georgia and we certainly will keep an eye on that and Elizabeth Warren with her big announcement will anything come of that today all of that and much more when we join you again tomorrow morning at six am hope you'll join us have a great Dane [noise]\nBoy so Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nGood morning I'm\nNick ... W. R. K. O. news Turkish authorities plan to enter the Saudi constantly in ... today we're journalists ... was last seen nearly two weeks ago and he sees bill nearly isn't as temple with the latest\nUh and then you have the Saudi Government saying well we don't know anything about this week you know we didn't do anything we don't we don't know what's going on\nBut the ... no nothing the reason why sergeant shots in in you know we are the reason why this has the potential to be really disruptive\nIs twofold number one obviously Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer in the world right okay so they they are the biggest in the low cost producer as well\nAnd they can take they they can lower worldwide production by as much as ten percent if they chose if they want it to ... and they could cause prices well how could they cause prices that\nBecause there are so much you can see prices double now that if if they said we're ... wrote a report said you know you could see two hundred dollar oil if if Saudi Arabia wanted to sustain\nOil now they would be inflicting a tremendous amount of pain on themselves if they did that though\nThey would I mean again that when you talk about the economy of Saudi Arabia is oil there on this campaign to try to divert guy and they go force that they are the they are in an oil economy there are Petro state that is what they do\nUm so the first concern is hey you know if they wanted to they could potentially saying look we're going to pull five six million barrels of oil off the you know off the market right now\nPotentially spike I don't know if that's necessarily what they ended up doing\nWhy would they do it let's talk about what we ... if if there's a conclusion that they murdered this journalist ... ... what what would our response be we say well we're not going to sell you the armaments were Oregon uh\nI don't know it could be you know that three hundred and fifty billion dollar arms deal could be something that's talked about there could be financial sanctions that could be a whole bunch of different things\nThe reason why this is really important okay and and this is not just looking at a water gas prices going to be over the next twelve months mhm Saudi Arabia for the last forty years has been the reason why the u._s. dollar has value okay the reason why is because back in Nineteen Seventy three after the Nixon shock back in Seventy one\nThe U.S went to Saudi Arabian said hey look we want to make a deal where we are going to affect that we have the barrel or have a barrel of oil prices in US dollars and that's going to be the only way you can trade in Saudi Arabia because they were the world's largest producer one of the world's largest producers\nSaid yeah we we can get on board that it gives us a guaranteed market for a product of gives us stability\nIn the U.S said hey now people need to buy US dollars and that's why the dollar remains the world's reserve currency for the last forty years if Saudi Arabia says gee we see where the puck is going and we see that China's going to all of a sudden be our biggest buyer over the next Twenty years now\nPlus you're saying you want to sanction us for something that we may or may not have done again I I don't know what happened I think it's likely the Saudi Arabia probably did something but here's the thing\nTurkey is not really someone you can trust either on\nWell and if you were in a way we treat like we do business with a lot of bad actors but\nHere's like turkey just two years ago ... went and murdered a whole bunch of journalists themselves also in jail a whole bunch of professors in a crackdown themselves so you're sitting there going okay I don't know like ... you're pretty much given me bad a or B ... what what do I choose Russia does the same thing exactly so\nThere's a whole bunch of this now keep in mind the Russia model is this kind of the when you look at where he said gee we've sanction them for similar things you know you talk about like the Magnitsky Act and things like that\nThose are the exact kinds of things that this is built to deal with so I I I look at this and I said look if the U.S says hey we're going to sanction you were going to pull back from this Saudi Arabia might say you know what we're going to move away from pricing wound dollars we're going to go in and find you know a different trading\nPartner so it was it and it's in between a rock and a hard place isn't it yes he's he's damned if he does any damned if he does yes there is\nNo right answer on this ... and that's why no one wants to job of being president like this ... this is something that no matter what the price decide is going to have big implications for where things go in the future because if he says look\nSaudi Arabia didn't do anything we're not going to do anything ... hey that pretty much give them ... videos you want to go nuts what gives it gives Saudi Arabia carte blanche to go do whatever they want going\nBut they've been doing it they just have done it much more quietly in the past exactly they China does it sure does this turkey like not you know they don't make a list of the countries that do it partake a whole bunch of them but like this is just a blatant in your face thing and that's that's the difference I think in this case is for\nThis is one where turkey allegedly has it on videotape ... there's there's all kinds of measures that they were nice that\nYou know there's there's one rumor that's going around that was from and and the reason that I stayed it even though it's you know somewhat of a rumor is because it's from bill Browder who was you know very prominent in actually passing the Magnitsky Act um who said look it was actually recorded from his I watch you know and like in that you have audio recordings that way so\nWho knows what's going on here but this has the potential to be a huge mess yeah well we can't overstate this\nThe are the issues that you should be concerned about folks is you turn your feet on this weekend most view a an oil trading at Seventy one dollars a barrel and you know you're going to get a delivery of home heating

Z deposit dot net J what is the CSI deposit\nVery we created a security deposit product to really help the problem a lot of landlords are facing with security deposit which is you know one it's time consuming to open these small and oh security ...\nAnd you have to go into the branch got signed paperwork and they're small dollars and they turn\nAnd it's certainly the complaints in Massachusetts really tough for landlords and security deposit account you have to give till ten in certain forms when they open up the account and you have to pay interest ... and you can do all this now through Z deposit all that you can do Thursday deposit it literally takes about forty seconds to open up an account\nWe handled the automatic forms that are generated with the account number department condition statement all that send to the tenant and interest is sent to the tenant automatically every year\nThis sounds like something that's going to be very valuable to large landlords that might have two hundred tenants and small landlords that might only have five ten\nYeah absolutely with a large landlords it's just a lot of hassle to manage this so we make that very efficient for the small landlords a lot of them are afraid of not getting the complaints done correctly so that some of them some of them don't even like taking security deposit to we're hopeful that this will help them do that\nFolks if you'd like to learn more about CSI deposit go to their website Z deposit dot net or you can call and speak to somebody under Z deposit team it's seven eight one six for one eight six

the price of oil it's over Seventy one dollars a barrel tenure treasury at three fourteen how high did it get last week\nWe got up to three twenty four I'm ... with the NASDAQ being down like that that makes me nervous just because that had been your market leadership and so that remains in negative territory I don't think it bodes necessarily to well what what what's going on talk her\nOr just kind of amazing to [laughter] if they just said I I heard I heard you laugh and and I ... I'm Sorry it was about the pet thing is is Barry five to for the vet are at the fluffy yeah [laughter] there you go well\nThe ah you know it's it's ah it it happens you know but everybody does it it said no Goshen will face specially if you have like uh you you you take your Thirteen year old with you to the vet you try telling your Thirteen year old you're not gonna you know\nInvest why you don't get a dog when your kid is born [laughter] because if the exact situation that I outlined if if it's terrible you know it's terrible but yeah the this this market here\nI think is going to show a lot of the same signs that we saw back in the spring where hey it's going to take a couple of months to get this back together any kind of figure out\nOr what things should be valued at going forward so I don't necessarily think that things are going to fall off the table right now but I think we've got a couple more months to some of some volatility before this thing comes down here and so\nGot a few listeners chime in on the nurses ballot question nine seven eight says hospital professionals no better than the government neither nine seven eight says Barry no one question one more government involvement is never good gotta agree with that\n... this isn't even government involvement though what his government individual involve them this is the you know direct democracy and I think that for things like this direct democracy\nIt's not the best tool because it's a complicated issue this this would be like you know if if you had a vote like ... you know what side of the road should we drive on half the people would say okay let's ... like ... it's just not something that you want people voting on\nAnything you follow the UPS story it'll\n[noise] a little bit we didn't really a dig into it last week those drivers got screwed so what do you think's gonna happen here on this I don't know but ... should\nBe taken out back and shot I mean this guy is the scum of the earth that\nHe ... the union votes fifty five percent of the membership says\nHey we do we reject this contract this is a bad deal we don't want to if you look at the New England numbers I looked at the the voting based on the region's truck it was like eighty five percent of the New England chapter for the Teamsters said hey we're getting screwed do not accept this field\nAnd you know the fifty five percent was just on a the the members who voted over all on the UPS Freight contract which covered a narrower twenty thousand workers sixty three percent rejected that contract and yet it's still ended up being ratified by union leadership here\nSo James Hoffa I think you're going to end up with a huge credibility problem for the union\nAnd this is the exact kind of thing if you talk about where you know populism tends to come from the kinds of things that we've seen over the last decade it comes from things like this when the average person the person who is working every day feels that the people who are empowered to make decisions for them don't make decisions that actually give them what they want\nThis is going to cause all kinds of\nProblems the one thing that the unions should be ashamed of and not the ... leadership that the members themselves the drivers the guy's handling the packages they didn't vote they didn't show up to vote no only about half of them voted and that's you know like you have no right to complain about your contractor union when you don't even vote\nAnd that's why they were able to ratify this damn thing because they didn't get enough people voting\nYeah pretty much that's ... that's really the exact reason why if you go through and take a look\nAt the uh Teamsters constitution which I didn't know there was one button hey there's Teamsters constitution it quote grants the Teamsters general president the power to implement a contract is less than fifty percent of the members vote on a contract that then requires a two thirds no vote to reject\nIt supposed to be that that's the case only in a final offer\nA but it looks like that's what ended up happening here so even though this contract was a rejected pretty soundly by union membership that actually voted it was not enough to overcome the fact that the president can pretty much go through and say yeah we're going to push this through anyway\nYou know the Amazon pays more than UPS for entry level workers in these part time worker so if you're ... this thing may end up settling itself just bail yeah wage pressure so they're going to have guys\nUPS going to have a tough time hiring people for Thirteen bucks an hour when they can go across the street and make Fifteen at Amazon there were more they'll go to work at an Amazon warehouse\nI I'd be curious to see what you're going to be getting paid this winter and Amazon warehouse you'll see the ads I I'm going to guess Eighteen to twenty bucks an hour in this region why do you think management push to ratify this management or men ...\nUnion management why do you think union management push to ratify speculation that ... on the take [noise]\nI'll tell you what it is like if it doesn't look good it's not it doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nHe if you look at James Hoffa first of all forget his old man but you look at James Hoffa and his history that it's not not Rosie I don't know how he got the job in the first place ... he's a lawyer that's the other thing is to some consideration no one's\nAre you sick of working in finance or retail you might want to consider the biotechnology sector is growing very fast as a matter\nOf growth is about the double ... here here it is in twenty twelve six point one percent of mass life science companies are left their jobs voluntarily typically with another job and hand according to Radford this is a unit of global professional services\nUh last year that more than doubled to Thirteen percent so if you work in biotech there's a demand for your services especially if you happen to be a scientist\nYeah and the big thing that you're seeing is in order for these companies to try to retain talent obviously wages are moving up significantly but they're also throwing all kinds of perks people just try to keep him on board anything from gym memberships a you know uh you know the cafeterias on site that or you know high quality and this and that\nChild care you know all kinds of things\nThe big thing that people like that work for these biotech companies is the time off I talked to a gal\nAnd she's working at a you know it's a small biotech money so they don't have the gym memberships and India and the other ...\nWhat they do is at Christmas the weak Christmas they just shut down the entire week a whole week them and they're going to do it now for the July Fourth week and it doesn't count towards your time off so you get your four weeks of vacation time plus your personal days or whatever\nUm but you have two weeks it you know in the middle of the year and at the end of the year where you get a full vacation week that you don't have to use your vacation I that if you're raising a family so it's a very valuable for\nAnd it it it's one of those things where if if you look at it there's a lot of industries where they can't do that anything customer service facing you can't do that kind of financial services there can't do it but for something like this where all you're doing as a whole bunch of research you can coordinate research schedules you you you get you can do that kind of thing so\nIt's it's really interesting that these businesses are kind of pushing the envelope as far as hey you know we can't necessarily pay people more will give you all kinds of different perks or they might still you know offer significant benefits\nA lot of money pouring into that sector there as you look at their companies\nYou know there'll be trained at three bucks and then a couple of weeks later they're treated at twenty dollars a share 'cause they got some kind of F. D. M. O. takes is like some kind of a drug approval of the opposite way too though that's the problem yeah oh they do ... you can make a lot of money enemy can lose an awful lot of money in yeah\nSpeaking of which Medicare premiums are going up modestly next year unless you make a lot of money you see that if if you make a lot of money your Medicare premiums are going to be over a thousand bucks a year\nYeah it's it's something where\nUh the the part B premium so which this year have been\nA hundred and thirty four dollars the ... a month they're going up to a hundred and thirty five fifty so it's only a modest it's a really small increase and I don't know what the reasons for that I don't know if they've been better cracking down on fraud I don't know if they've found you know better reimbursement rates to keep prices down\nBut that is a really small increase for Medicare premiums and what that means is that people who are getting Social Security bumps meaning everyone who gets that two point eight percent bump on Social Security so what's that work out to about forty bucks a month yeah they're going to be able to keep most of that now what is\nBeing ... there have been so many years were either people have gotten no bump for Social Security or it's been all eaten up by increases in Medicare premiums\nAnd this is really good ... again\nYou know let's put it this way though Chuck if you're living on your Social Security you're working as well\nYou you're not living you can't pay your bills in New England and live on the ...

going out and buying treasuries okay\nAnd your fear is that they'll buy less going for\nThey already have them located China's ... twenty fourteen\nForeign buyers have been ... neutral as far as what they've been buying there and so the question then is if you have rates going up meaning that the the the treasury is going to have to pay more on the bonds that issues at auction\nAid that extra interest is going to eat into the federal budget which means we have to borrow more or cut other programs for it and so you end up with this crowding out scenario because you don't have foreign buyers to sterilize the U.S debt anymore and you potentially end up with some nasty situations as a result of that\nIt's not something that's guaranteed to happen because hey maybe things get cleared up internationally and all of a sudden China says yep we're happy to buy treasury is again I don't think that's happening now doesn't see I don't think that's happening China sees an existential threat to being tied to the dollar and they want to move away from it\nYou still love chick fillet\nSet a question Tucker that kind of questions I never been we've been over this I don't have any near me might address twenty five miles\nAnd go to one you should you should I was your age your life I was looking at every I was looking at chick fillet and I said to myself why would somebody\nBy a McDonald's franchise as opposed to a chick fillet or why would somebody by a subway franchise I guess subway franchise is more expensive to buy\nThan chick fillet franchise you can get a mix on you can get a chick fillet franchise for like twenty grand but you know what\nThere's twenty thousand apple is sort of and getting into Harvard it's it's unbelievable twenty thousand people apply to buy a chick flick a you know how many they give out a little less than a hundred yeah\nSo it's they get something going on you have a less than half a percent chance of actually being approved to to buy one of these franchise so they're looking for somebody that they can mold and they they also don't sell you you can't say well I Want to buy all the chick fillet franchises in New England\nFor all the trick for where you can buy one\nOn unlike McDonald's which now is looking for people to buy more than one McDonalds if you go on their website and take a look at their franchise got the franchisee guidelines they want people who can by five ten Fifteen twenty they want but obviously you're not operating\nThem great like chick fillet saying yeah we'll let you in the door for twenty grand yup right but you have to be there every day you've got to hire the people you've got to make sure grief the customer like if you own a chick fillet franchise it's not you're not operating it from the sea sweet no on the floor\nThey they want you to be active in one of the key things is when you go through a what they detail that they want one of the biggest things they don't want you have any other active business ventures I Want you to be all in on this franchise\nAnd I'll tell you one of the you know I talk about how good the food is a check for ... again I I Love the Chicken Little something about like I Love the chicken this customer service that I have gotten there not only is better than any other fast food restaurant I've seen\nIt rivals some actual you know sit down dining establishment in terms of the overall quality that you get\nYou get managers who were literally managers walking around picking up trash saying hey can I get you anything do you need ice and that you get people coming up to help you more often than I've ever seen and I think when I talk about you know the chick flick experienced and why I think it's better\nThe food's one thing but customer service is something that's been largely left out of the last Twenty years just about everywhere because it all gets sent you know to think about any customer services aren't so you've had whether it's with ... whether it's the L whoever it is it's generally not good\nI don't I disagree with you there you go to an American restaurant\nAnd you are generally going to get\nPretty good service I guess we came back ... we were in Paris for a week ... want to talk about bad service tribe visiting Paris ... what was bad about it maybe they knew you were American ... well maybe not about it ... the the waiters do they don't get much in the way a tips right so they make you know\nFifteen twenty euros an hour but because people don't tip for reasons don't tip\nAh they the you get just God awful ...\nWhat was that was a slow did they not bring the rate like\nWhat we actually we had added on it usually just slow ... it wasn't like the a lot of times people say oh the French air and it and they weren't ... they were very nice but it was just like you you could go literally twenty minutes with your Empty Plates and you're in front of you know I when I'm done when you I Want my plate gone I think part of that just as a cultural different I I was\nJust about to say that check I think in America everything's fast paced and getting get out and over there it's just way more laid\nThey want you to spend like two or three hours eating\nRight no well I I Would I Would take American service over a European I said I think\nTo today's the day boys by the way I just Google a chick fillet near me and there's one in debt which I was not aware of oh which is right on the way home so you're going to go and I think I might\nBut they they if that answers the question as to why people don't buy ... how much does manager make if you if you buy one of these franchises\nWhat kind of money going to make are we talking a manager or the ... or the ... and you will you go out ... like really you're only paying twenty grand to get the franchise so really what they're doing is they're hiring managers [noise]\nYou're you're buying the opportunity to be a manager for ... for a chick\nFillet so I can do some research okay based on what I'm finding initially okay this is a from someone I found this on line this from someone who is a former marketing director at chick fillet\nUm but it looks like if you talk about the base\nRevenue that you get plus some profit sharing and so forth it looks like the low end is about a hundred thousand a year into the high end is well north of three fifty so my guess is most people are probably between two hundred and three hundred a year when it's all said and done a good living and go early and and you don't have to work Sundays\nNo and and I
