I Am sure that the all those shows are really bad but you can't call the the ultimate ... not bad shows are bad show I Do not old enough to be saying things like he is too young to be playing that guy ever know I I'm not that old\n[laughter] that's ... [laughter] the last word\nRight what do we get cold here today uh one thing go to W. R. dot com I have a column up I Know nobody cares but Jay Gonzales if you're listening is not over yet you can still win this governor's race and I put forth three possible scenarios in which he can when\nYou think I'm joking but they're they're lightning you were there when I was writing it are those all if any one of the three that I mentioned happens really not win\nPretty good yeah humid though I did Charlie what Dr Joe ... years old and I tell you to go to the ... let's just [noise]\nI'll give you one Wednesday night Charlie gives out all the way in candy that has nuts and doesn't tell anybody does not some kid as an allergic reaction to it J you're going to be governor so it can happen is don't hang in there\nI'm\nI'm reading this three decades that could happen they I'm sure\nIf those happen Jay ... manner so Jay check it out of your co dot com or\nThe first to have happened to other people that's why they're in there they've happened so it could happen to Charlotte aren't\nSecond of all uh I just got to play this because I cannot do they go by without plan do see the courage to Neal's interview Martha McDowell my dead soccer's meals and homeland security director degrees to a sit down which I thought was surprising based on now\nHot button some of this stuff is and I'm Glad that the administration letter and she was extremely confident find first of all they're both wearing their aviator sunglasses which was a weird lock funny weird\nBut okay then\nThis exchange actually happens this really was discussed on these ...\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border they could be shot at\nWhen they have any intention right now people will be apprehended however a ... officer an agent at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they have the ability of course to defend themselves\nSo shot at which it back I just I think\nWe'd have to work through that but I Want to make it very clear and we will absolutely not tolerate violence against border patrol and the situation\nThat conversation really happened all I Know [noise]\nLike first of all\nAnd I guess in twenty gene you ask him but is crazy is that because I\nDo not necessarily do hear her laughing in the first answer and you actually follow up seriously on it\nI don't think you I don't think you have to ask that twenty Eighteen [noise]\nI mean if the answer is yes or they ever going to say yes that's how I I don't know maybe they would I Try to avoid Trump's said maybe\nBut I just from watching that going wow this does exchange just happened this really did Martha much alum made a point of saying well you shoot somebody and when she said no we're not going to shoot anybody she\nFollowed up with what would you shoot somebody clearly you don't listen to this show because I feel like based on this morning not only do a lot of people think it could be thinking should\nI sadly there are some people that are extremely disappointed encouraged him you know from there I was more general than I thought she did an excellent job and I like her\nWhat bothers me like she should have been as apparently\nIt's such a crazy exchange and because of that I guess Martha Magellan was in the right to ask\nBut there was that really happened with gas I saw that\nA gym do you have something yeah a man was arrested in a Salisbury in Great Britain before trying to steal the magna Carter with Iraq [noise]\nNot a good idea to break the glass but he just arrested metal you know they didn't open fire on orders from twelve Fifteen yeah it has never been stolen I sometimes the simplest way is the way but not a\nYeah he ... he tried to smash the glass box that hold it with Iraq was arrested [noise]\nThat's true you give that guy I'm telling you that guy's lucky he was just arrested I don't know but now the injured or you give them I if I were if it were I Would put I Would put them in a cell and I would put his dinner under a glass case and say here's your Rocco\nNow [laughter] best of luck to you [laughter] [noise]\nSo it got into funding\nUm my last\nWord today is that\nWhen it rains it pours and this is I'm going back to Megan Kelly from it\nIn the last hour that we've been on the air the daily\nMail has now come up with about ... four more stories about Megan Kelly and\nOne is that there are pictures of al broker and to my ... jam or how and they're smiling because they are so happy that she is out at NBC\nAnd the other is now their lead story um which is that um Christian power powers we used to be on her show regularly\nWarned NBC that she's a racist and that they should never hire her\nI mean I got to tell you I think that uh she might do or sell some good to just get this thing negotiated out and and\nTake cover because slowly but surely you know people are coming up it's it's amazing when people are down people like to kick them and kick 'em really hard and some could argue that you know she's not down because when you have a sixty nine million dollar contract they're not really down but\nIt is unbelievable to me how people cannot wait to just bury you [noise]\nSo and whether deserved or not you know I mean she's she's she's losing her job and she's being publicly humiliated how about we just leave it right there but filed by\nMurray you have anything yeah I found this really interesting I never heard of this before about a Disneyland and Disney World had a process in place for when people try to scatter their family is run names in their parks\nDidn't even think that was a thing but apparently the most popular place for people to try to scatter their families ashes as the hunted mansion in magic kingdom did you know that isn't that wild\nI knew they were doing this and it doesn't surprise me also I'm laughing because when you say didn't know this was the thing I feel like you're going to run to ... to switch your wish [laughter]\nI mean I can see why they would because if they are obsessed with Disney yeah gosh I Want to lay there forever but it's on earth do you know right right it's apparently and they have a process in place where\nYou're telling me you wouldn't love to have your ashes in like a Donald's of porcelain sort of thing like Donald's top off and there's ... there are right in the right in the bowl\nHey you guys we're we're almost out of time I got to get this in quick we missed this today we talk about it Google\nA ghoulish or gross Starbucks unveils a special which is proof rapid Chino for Halloween out there right now is ... that are made into bat ward almost\nCheck it out or whatever we can\nSay I hope by the time we come back\nWe've got a series under our belt let's keep our fingers crossed to have a great weekend everybody\nBoy so Boston New York about one hundred point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nWell I I think there's a couple of different pieces here a number one is if you're talking about the the ability of U.S companies to export goods from the U.S come tougher this year because the dollars up their number one if you're a company based in the U.S that trying to export to other countries\nYou're not investing in exports to begin with because the dollar stronger and then also you're sitting there saying gee I've got these terrorists that are out there that are looming and I don't know what the situation is on that front\nA and so that's a concern if you're a business owner as well so I think those are major contributors to this\nThe dollar issue you know might go away but it's something that could get a little bit worse before it gets better there\nUm and the other thing to keep in mind on this uh GDP report here is you know one thing that may reverse itself and that may make the fourth quarter look a little bit better we did see a spike in imports in this quarter with a lot of companies trying to import goods before tariffs went into effect\nSo that is something that did create a little bit more drag in this quarter here and that could reverse itself and maybe you know companies say okay now we need to source more domestically and you could get a bounce back in that business fixed investment number but it's something that you know it's it's it's a concern just because we haven't seen this in two plus years now\nAnd it's it's just unusual to see a decline like that from where we were\nI have concerns about it but I'm going to take the optimistic view and I think I'm going to say that going through the end of the year here we're going to have consumer spending pick up to a level that\nMaybe it reverses this business trend that we will see maybe it maybe I'm wrong about this but I think that consumer spending especially through the end of this year and starting through next year I think may pick up the slack of what we're seeing on the drop in business investment\nFor third quarter GDP in at three point five percent little better than expected Mike's ... well how would you describe yourself cautiously optimistic is that a fair\nAnd just only because I hear\nEveryone you know you're calling for you and we're right in the middle of big market volatility and I hear everyone around calling for a recession and I just don't see it so I don't think this this GDP report does anything to tell me that we are headed imminently towards recession I Do get concerned about decreases in business spending but that can reverse quickly\nMike cautiously optimistic Chuck more cautiously pessimistic ... will go from there which talked about a couple of companies that reported earnings after the bell yesterday there both tech companies\nAmazon and alphabet both reporting a and both down significantly today after reporting Amazon now off\nAbout eight point five percent right now alphabet stock currently off about four point eight percent so boats down notes north of four percent in both kinda with similar as you're not the exact same but similar issues net revenue a little bit weaker than expected and margins being pressured\nYeah unfortunately for Google they've got the that combined with a lot of regulatory issues that Amazon is currently facing right now so that's been a bit of a combined whack against their stock price today and you can take a look at you know you can look at the chart and see that they've been under combined pressure there\nUm you know and Amazon's case it's just a story of ... and maybe this is just to you know one quarter type of issue but it seems to be a story of they can't continue to grow with the rates they've grown up forever\nAnd perhaps expectations were just a little bit too lofty here for this company so they saw profits that were in line but revenue drops that we're a little bit of a surprise\nUh pretty much across the board you know even the Amazon Web services division which has been the you know profit center for the whole company of the last few years even that you know it didn't shrink but it's a slow down as they saw more competition coming out of Google and Microsoft\nYeah the ... and certainly I think both of these companies you know one of the big questions that I think a lot of investors tend to have is look you know Amazon has been so good for so long one and I just put my whole portfolio into that company because they're not based on what they're doing today they're based on projections of growth Ryan ... and so forth\nAnd that's why you see in a time where by the way the S. and P. five hundred just entered into correction territory meaning a it is more than ten percent off\nA of it's a lot of it's all time high now temper that Amazon right now is down twenty percent okay from its high of just over two thousand fifty dollars a share\nSo the risk with a company like Amazon you take on because the valuation so lofty there's more room for it to follow it does fall and since the start of October about twice as much as the rest of the market sure\nYeah absolutely and if you if you were one of those that bought back in September you're almost you know definitely kicking yourself a little bit here\nUm I bought last week and I'm Still kicking myself a little bit so you know that's not to say that there isn't room for reversal here with Amazon but they have been just the darling of the stock market to the last decade and this is a little bit of a cooling down period for them let's call it\nBefore we had to break was also talk a little bit ... earnings Versailles increasing on higher prices they're able to push through some higher commodity costs or to their ah their customers their ... what do you make this quarter for ...\nUm one I haven't seen anything in the news recently about a mass groups of people getting horribly sick from eating their food is good you know as long as they can do that quarter after quarter that's great\nThat big number that I saw that I really like for this company digital sales at forty eight point three percent and a quarter of making up eleven percent of sales and what we've seen from other companies that are able to convert on this is once you get people ordering stuff from your app\nOn line they will come back and they'll come back more frequently and spent more money on that application\nAnd especially to pull away the biggest criticism aside from you know occasionally having problems with ... always been the customers from occasionally making people throw up\nAre the biggest problem that I personally have them in that a lot of people did was the line is too damn along the line takes forever yeah it's great food but I don't want to wait in line for half an hour and you get mobile ordering figured out boom you got a whole lot more that you can do their\nSo us when your mobile order and you're not embarrassed about discussing food that you're having to you know tell the uh tell the person take riveted our ... at night just put it right in the ... nobody

Snapchat down fourteen point seven four percent what went wrong\nEverything as can just struggling with this company ... it seems to be a pretty common issue that we're seeing with a number of different um social media companies insofar as they are managing to extract a little bit more revenue and profit from their users\nBut their growth of daily actor users is declining as so they actually Snapchat saw it declined dropping daily active users\nAh they expect to continue losing some customers but they are are delivering a little bit more revenue from those customers that they have but at the end of the day you've got a a sinking ship here or potentially if they continue to lose customers unless they find a way to get them back\nSo that's what Wall Street cares about they're not terribly interested in the profit numbers the revenue numbers they want to see what those daily active users are doing and therefore stock is off nearly Fifteen Percent right now\nWith a lot of these social media networks there's a lot of chatter that oh you know this app redesigned didn't work or that one didn't do these features how much of this is just people hate these things now I don't know if anyone ever say gee I really love Snapchat or wow I Love these like\nI don't see anyone walk around like oh these are great systems I see and being like\nMan it's awful but it's the

I'm\nI'm a once a week you know among All right\nLet's talk a little bit about uh the plan that the president is proposing try to lower Medicare drug costs what what are we seeing here my\nThroat we've been talking about this since President Trump took office and it looks like he's putting together a plan B\nIdea behind that is that right now the United states most people I think are recognized as the United states on average\nPays considerably more for prescription drugs than the rest of the world as the rest of world specifically Europe puts a very specific price controls a on drug makers if they want to sell their drugs in their countries\nAnd therefore the United states and that ends up paying a lot more and ended up driving a lot of the research and development that gets done on these the idea here\nIs that President Trump is proposing a plan where they would create an index of\nInternational costs for drug prices and then Medicare will be required to negotiate down to that price so two things could happen here either the drug companies would have to raise prices and the foreign countries to get that index price hire you asked that they could charge more in the United states or more likely\nUnited States prices come down a little bit and international prices go up a little bit to offset that this isn't\nIt is this playing being proposed on every drug that's out\nThere it is not there is a specially it just seems like a little bit of a beta testing so they're gonna do it for just a few different prescriptions that Medicare has\nA certain drugs made by a single manufacturing those known as biologics ah those made from living organisms and it's going to be going from twenty twenty to twenty twenty five is where they're going to be experimenting on this\nUm it seems to be a worthwhile seems very worthwhile endeavor I mean one of the biggest complaints that I have is Medicare basically can't negotiate a price it\nKnow that that's built into their rules for well really because that was the only way they could get to the Affordable CARE Act passed through all the money that the pharmaceuticals wearing the gifts so\nThis is a big issue I don't know if this will solve the issue but it seems on the surface like it would be a worthwhile endeavor the drug industry by the way going to be fighting this vehemently that they're going to be a lot of money spent on getting Congress to shut this down\nGoing back to social media also always thought Twitter report or their earnings are late yesterday they are taking the opposite passive Snapchat they're up over ... over fifty percent in a in their trading what did analysts about Twitter compared with Snapchat\nI'm so first off they're not losing users they are seeing a little bit of a slow down and the growth of users but that is okay because they're not actually losing any they're just not growing but why does it affect\nThe hitters giving away all these games by the way all and I had been given a not not all of them but ... but I mean the entire mortgage given that Saddam yeah so they're going back a little bit today\nUm their third quarter revenue climbed twenty nine percent what analyst liked about this as they are really pushing ads and pushing their monetize and their customers which they haven't done to date in in one of\nSome of the messages that I get from her this is a sample of like a message that I Would get hey by the way you know I was at the store today and I was doing this and then I ran into so and so and I ran into this and that and and oh by the way it\nCan you pick up milk you know it's a three minute message that I Know I just tell me pick up milk everyone's grade I can get my facts about\nAnyways the U.S and China haven't really heard of people on trade talks in the last couple of weeks here any sense that things are moving behind the scenes or still kind of some hang ups to just getting to the table\nAnd less they are being incredibly sneaky about it it seems like things are just completely stalled out right now there's the hope to have a meeting scheduled right now if the end of November at the G ... summit\nI'm looking potentially unlikely that that even happens the U.S is basically refused to resume and then go ... and tell Beijing comes out with a proposal to Washington that addresses the complaints about forced technology transfers and quote other economic issues\nI Believe there's a whole list of some hundred and sixty seven hundred and forty two separate demands at the U.S has put in\nAnd um China's just hesitant to put out anything from ... to be fair one I think we're probably taking the right tactic here which has just don't even begin negotiations until they come up and give you something\nBut China on the other hand saying if we put out anything than we are fears it's going to get linked to the press and then we're going to come from a week and go shooting point\nBy the way some some data on you know how companies are mentioning and responding to tears this is according to Bloomberg uh in the course over the course of twenty eight team the number of companies that are mentioning tariffs are the number of transcripts that have mentioned them over the course of the year so far\nTwenty one hundred and eighty eight if you go back to last year we didn't get above seven hundred even listen ... you're talking to your three times as much activity on the side as last year do you feel like it's just\nBeing used as an excuse for companies know now you think it said to me this you\nKnow I I I again just from talking to people in the construction industry and what's happened to prices on that side for steel and aluminum yeah it's it's it's a real issue there um as far as you know can can you get projects done at certain prices\nUm and that's just in one industry there's definitely some businesses that are using it as an excuse you know I I always hate when companies you know used you know oh we had bad weather and so like we write\nLike grow up ... happened cheesecake factory don't blame you are terrible sales on bad weather here\nImprove your product improve your product but damn good change like this real like you know whether I sit there and I go look there's always whether they're always hurricanes there's always snow yep you figure out how to deal with it OK stuff like this these the kinds of things have there aren't always terrorists that are coming into effect so these are things that I Do think have a more meaningful ... where\nWould you put if you're a gay man where would you put the likelihood the odds of anything getting done on trade with China like a concrete plan before end of this year twelve percent cut them down they're very very unlike\nThirteen not eleven but those weren't odd but that's OK twelve percent I don't understand odds what I wanted I'd had you know a different story ab ... the big a beer maker or they make Budweiser ... they make just about every ... uh yeah\nUm so they are struggling and they actually cut their dividend in half\nThat they're not strong I mean when you cut your dividend in half that's a pretty big message or sending\nSo here's the thing they bought SAP Miller when was it two years ago maybe three three three years ago the exact wrong time to ... oh you know it's awful climbing\nThe exact wrong time to make that deal and they're paying for it now why they're cutting their dividends they took on so much debt to make that deal and consumers taste of changed\nYou know I I think back to three years ago and you know I already thought that at that point the craft beer market was you know really getting crazy and wild and sort of peaking and it has gotten so much bigger since that three year ago and they just continue to take market share away from Budweiser\nAnd I'll tell you the latest ads where they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers or are they have you seen these though it's the ones where they've got the guys you know the ... and you go to Bud Light is for everyone that someone's going oh do you have a mean they're ... they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers yeah\nWhat does not a good way to get people to come back to product\nBut I mean the Bud Light can make fun of a craft drinkers all they want but then on the other side of it they're coming out with these Budweiser products you know a Budweiser freedom reserve red laughter\nIs one of them and they came out recently and the great bottles what's and what's your name on the barrel and

to be taken seriously because what is not a hoax is that this is intended to terrorize people\nWhen this when they first started back a couple of weeks ago you know a lot of people from our tastes kind of similar myself included I remarked pay the bills kind of similar to what we saw earlier this year\nSince then I I've kind of moved off that 'cause we've got an economic data that suggest hey we've got you know real slow down the housing that's coming this force this third quarter GDP report had some questions where do you stand as far as not necessarily how bad this could get because again we're not trying to make predictions here 'cause neither of us know\nWhat do you get the sense this thing is a quick dip like we saw in the spring or do you get to get the fences might linger a little bit even if you don't know exactly where it goes you\nKnow I still draw a lot of correlations back to what we saw in February and I like you don't make myself in the business of productions but I can see a few instances where you could see a rally of this coming back rather quickly if you if you get the midterms behind you and all of a sudden you see a very strong consumer spending towards the end of the year\nTo me that would be an indication that things are going to recover rather quickly or but it could go the other way to hey I I hate to\nJump in here and try and lay claim is aware I think the stock market's going to go over the next sixty days 'cause nobody knows\nKnown and and I think the the big thing isn't so much trying to say hey here's where it's going to go but hey what what's important to watch and I booked hey anything housing related you you have to be watching that because that's one of the concerns\nSo focused on housing folks that some of the the big you know kind of existential questions what's going on with trade negotiations going on in Europe with\nUh the Italian government their ability to get a budget passed you know those are the things that you need to be asking yourself hey what kind of progress are we seeing and I think when you start to get some of those answers we can get more clarity but for now it it's tough to find a path to a quick bounce back for me but it said that any of these things resolved themselves and you might see that'd be the impetus\nYeah by the way you know I Know a lot of people looking at elections and saying oh that's going to be a huge thing that gets the markets one way or the other I Would really discouraged you to putting putting too much stock in politics and how they impact the stock market because if

here\nThere's a couple of companies that they have recently acquired and they're specifically they do pretty much the same thing as air B. and B. but what they try and do is have a better relationship with the people that actually all the places that are getting rented out so one of the big issue that they identified as people that are\nReleasing an apartment and then stop letting it out on the air B. and B. and er that creates issues for the owners they don't want that it can create issues for the a condo association there can be rules against that sort of thing [noise] so what this service uh the one company called pillow and want to call department jak where\nThey specifically contract with both the lease holder as well as the owner of the unit to make sure that you know the owner knows who's going to be in the apartment and a number of different factors to make it just a little bit more secure in a way they're renting this out\nDo you think this makes what one of the questions that I I've raised with regards to air being the is you're seeing ... he's pushing back on either setting limits are saying hey you can't do this do you think this helps to square away some of those problems and maybe makes this a more\nUm you know not favorable but I guess a more reasonable landscaping company similar to European beat operating\nAnd to be fair to air BNB they've taken some pretty big moves to make things a little bit safer and make things or\nI guess a compliance with local jurisdictions in terms of you know collecting collecting taxes and things have gone does nature

half percent today in the day were markets are down anywhere from one to two percent depending on the index that you're looking at a what a what the good news they just keep them afloat right now you know\nTheir their demand for specifically their computer chip seems to be continuing and even rising the chipmaker profit surged forty two percent um eh despite some delays and rolling out their new

twelve person boarded Campbell Soup not just add a board cedar pick up a couple here and there they want to replace the entire twelve person board first question is why second question is what's going on\nWell they're alleging that Campbell's you failed to disclose or disclose them you know ... it's misleading information about their business and my guess year assert points coming out with a very you know forceful a strong points here and then it's going to back off a little bit and but they're probably going to get a few boards it's over this would be my guess\nWhy does third point I Want to control Campbell Soup and presumably\nYou get in there and you cut costs across the board and that that's generally what hedge funds to do a maybe a look at a sale\nEven though this is a stock that down you know almost fifty percent in the last two and a half years\nNo one's boss not no one's buying can't people are still buying Campbell Soup they still have sales obviously yeah but they're really struggling to make kind of inroads in a market where people are buying the same types of food products they weren't even just a year or two ago right did you know we've seen dramatic changes there\nI think that's their points entire point though is they're saying a lot okay you're you're bored and you're management has clearly they don't address changing consumer behavior is you need somebody from the outside to come in and change the company uh and that's probably a third points you know idea here\nI think that this could be a pretty good and easy sale to a company like craft times okay to do something along those lines yeah I mean I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen but it would seem like it would pretty easily fit into that business model\nI Will say you know look I'm I'm not a big Campbell Soup fan in general but there's something about their tomato soup on a on a cold winters day with a little grilled cheese dipped in it that it it it's there's just something right about\nThe grilled cheese and tomato soup very sad but specifically Campbell's yeah\nYou know I'm more of a progressive guy myself get at a before we go to a break and we'll revisit
