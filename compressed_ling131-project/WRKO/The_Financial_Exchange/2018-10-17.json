I see the top taco on the thing is the vampire taco [noise]\nDoesn't mean anything to me 'cause I don't even know anything about it but just the fact that it says vampire or in October I said well we'll give me that back I said I Would ... within this thing quickly and she says it's what it says I said but is there a lettuce is because I Know it's everything that's in there I said can I get that without avocados you can get it she says you can get whatever\nTo give me that without avocado I said the salon throws fine because I figured the pork was going to hide and it did\nI got the vampire talk first time I've ever ordered a taco in a restaurant\nAnd was it was it a soft taco or a king yeah\nSo the vampire taco apparently is a street type taco late at night where\nIt's sort of our toggle buttons coated with cheese that they sort of black him or as they cook it so it's hard enough but it's not like a pull my God so I'm here I'm sure he was a picture\nSo that without the avocado\nBut I I got it I immediately realized ... those are my launches opposed to the salmon 'cause he's a really good now that I don't eat cheese often as you know we just talked about this but there is and there is she's on the ...\nIs is a cheese coating on the things I'm like I find them pirates I'm ... I'm ... I'm looking at right now on your age Larry Larry good so it will not be the last time I would I talk to you\nKnow we would your question though is that a taco like it's got an pork not beef and there's no red sauce in it whatsoever so she's in it only right on it there's a lot of garlic in it\nBut that's the new taco as far as I'm concerned that's like when you were a fish tacos there's none of that that traditional taco stuff\nYou know that's the stumps ever made won't be my leg and I'll be looking at those talk on the news a little closer\nTo me as something today uh yeah\nWell I I Would strongly recommend to my friend Merida that she checks out the W. CBD story that ran yesterday called the nine nine may Disney movies you didn't know about so I'll leave that for you for your allows alright thank you but er from my last word also at our friends at TV they put out a\nCandy store dot com which apparently is a fault candy company that distributes candy around this time yes put out the most popular candy and each day for Halloween off that is an the the candy most likely to be given out in each state and I guess is what we are as eight I was shocked\nNo um can you just tell us is it chocolate or is it not not chocolate ... would be my guess no [noise]\nSour patch yep\nPatch kids number one you know followed by butter finger and salt water taffy ... or ... salt water taffy around that and I taught water town hall in that I don't think runs in New Hampshire went with her ...\nYup yup [noise]\nWe in Hampshire like sneakers or even if that were shown in Rhode Island and they went with some unicorn\nWhich makes sense for Halloween candy I don't know all year round but Halloween her husband's a candy corn personally I Would like to shame of the state of Delaware because they were the only stayed on the entire list that went with lifesavers\nWait are those the gummy ones are the Mel lifesavers no just like the soccer lifesaver Christmas when you\nGet those book of life though on Ryan of all yeah that's right who wants that dropped in their homes that no one ... one was jolly ranchers that's ... ... ranchers are okay Shavers your grandmother's candy mhm that's true I agree\nSo naturally I like them really are not nobody likes them but they're not really I don't think of them is ... ... tax in your bag like right\nI like take tax but not for Halloween right yeah well that's that's good stuff though I like that that was a very good little survey and sour patches okay I was surprised by that I Love 'em that don't mean Halloween real little now they have all their little packets on them and yeah\nYeah you know what I don't like I don't like the people who put candy or put things into bags and they're not individually wrapped temp\nAt a laughing for me that the big issue\nIn the entire country the state where you're most likely per capita together joined candy barns there's something small that would be the good folks have Mississippi not a shock to me I was gonna say Texas is not the not everything's bigger in Texas the evidence that are in Mississippi they down\n[laughter]\n[laughter] we're ready to do everything\nSo mine actually candy to just funny I guess we're on food today and mine is about the the TV show stranger things that we do you watch that I think you do the gym or do they yeah they're coming out they've\nPartnered with the candy company it's sugar and they actually are putting out a candy in line for stranger things and they actually have a giant dummies lawful you know 'cause a lead them likes eh go waffles\nUm I thought this was pretty funny they have a\nCar in that you know that says you know this car is whether you have like a missing person well they came out with a car in filled with a multi ... milk balls and on the side and says where's ... so you know all these little planes on [laughter]\nShe went missing and they showed soil alerted far to\nDo something with malted milk balls that I missed and that's not really just be a play on the whole ... thing and the ... the milk fall of the military and sell the milk carton you know so they did that then uh so you can check it out I'll put it on the website or see the other\nHand I Want to your favorite Jimmy's melt and hold it is my I Love him but it shows you how long it's been since I had them but I forgot that came in a cartons yeah even the small they don't like the ... but yeah\nIt just this last weekend at a tailgate big old bowl of candy out on somebody's table and it was that's what it was that they come in for Halloween becoming a little packages like very uh I walked by that table about four times [laughter] yeah my dad loves the four times three with the twelve settled\nFor you does that mean you walk by and smelled and walked away or did you actually have um I don't mind if I had one of these or two or three or four days [laughter] now see I think it's cute but she thinks twelve multiple oh I've got one that's why I just wanted\nTo try to slow down our our [laughter] that was totally humiliation warm milk balls than your team scored though when you really have to leave it\nRight there everybody hope you have a great day we're going to be back tomorrow morning six AM please join us then [noise]\nOh boy so Boston New York about one hundred point seven till you see a like eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] may have evidence show\nGood morning I'm Nick Bovey\nW. R. kale news multiple reports out of turkey are indicating that investigators have an eleven minutes audiotape of the murder and just member meant journalist ... my ... reports\nOn Wall Street Journal is reporting that Jamal ... was killed upon his entrance into the Saudi Arabian consulate there was no botched interrogation and no drug injection the report\nAlso details the Turkish officials identified one voice on the recording as a Saudi forensic specialist who recommended that the other people in the room listen to music\nWhile he just member to show your body and the official who spoke to al ... you're on the condition of anonymity said the audio originates from a different source than the apple watch but the journalist was reportedly wearing when he entered the consulate on October second\nA mid air scare for first lady Melania Trump ABC's current Travers is that the White House with the latest\nFirst lady Melania Trump was en route to Philadelphia today for an official event when her flight was turned around due to a mechanical issue about ten minutes after take off from joint base Andrews outside of Washington Trump's plane landed safely at Andrews just after nine am\nGlobally the previous quarter you know you know it's like it the the reason to believe that they could slow is because they did for a quarter now I don't know if that's just because people you know just ... didn't you know didn't pick up the subscription as much I don't know if people said hey it doesn't make sense\nWell we used to ... where they would miss and it was because they didn't spend enough money advertising for it\nSo it's I think there are questions there that that still need to be raised as far as hey this is the stock price really expensively and then you know the other question they do have out there is you've got everyone in their grandmother starting up a streaming service now does that drive up content costs for them further\nIt it's definitely a competitive marketplace if you talk to people in that industry though they'd rather work for Netflix than they would Disney\nThey'd rather work for Netflix than they Woodfox they'd rather work for Netflix than virtually anybody else because they have more creative the more uh [noise] what am I trying to tell the ... more latitude they they can more flexibility when they're working for Netflix than they would if they're working for ABC\nThat's one ABC is the biggest competitor I don't think ABC is anymore you know you know you talk if you're talking about the type of Amazon's legit competitor wouldn't you say well I mean the biggest one no one to HBO yeah HBO is the big they they got forty million subscribers of their own in the United states like they are the biggest\nPetted or out there no one likes to talk about it because you know the oh they're all have them a year now AT and T. yeah because they tend to fall over another ... oh dear [laughter] and they and they TNT is coming out with the streaming product that's largely going to be based around HBO ...\nI think you know there is competition out there and you know and I know that we always think hey you know ABC ... completely different product at this rate um the ones that are going to be threats are going to be places like Amazon like a you know Eighteen anti now that they have HBO under their umbrella um those are going to be threats\nAnyway that Amazon and Eighteen T could collaborate\nOr what what what are you thinking well eat the the big issue is Amazon has this mode right in their spending what eight twelve billion dollars a year\nI'm saying like ATM fees product on Amazon or something like that when you think I don't know of Amazon would want to kind of ... their own offering and that way you get into the telecom business I I just I don't know if that's where they want to be going\nYou know we'll see it it's fascinating though ... verse ... if we did a poll ... probably not what do you think Ninety percent of our listeners have watched a net flip our where\nThey don't ... it was lower remember when we asked how many people subscribe to Netflix\nWell yeah but that's a different different uh yeah like you Tucker doesn't subscribe he's ... somebody else's no I have my own account thank you you didn't boil that still counts as a subscription whether you're my thought on on only moot no no it's just Chuck\nNo my parents are moving off me how that's right yeah well I have five ... pay back the pay them back for college Fifteen bucks at the time yep\nUm anyway that and the uh the Netflix story goes on and by the way if you own the shares their up Twenty one dollars today\nAbout today formed enough not today Mitch McConnell calls the rising budget deficit very disturbing\nHey you know there's there's a valid point here very when you have a bad economy if you if you're in a two thousand and eight and two thousand nine you should be running huge budget deficits right that that's when you run a\nTrillion dollar or two trillion dollar budget deficit to try to get people back to work when you have a four percent GDP you should either have a budget surplus or darn near a balanced budget\nYeah typically I don't really like the ... just because it means that you're taking in more tax revenue than you need are closer to a budget balance a balance but you could see that so if if you go and take a look in terms of you know where the money is actually being spent okay\nIf you're talking discretionary areas 'cause that's really what we're talking about right now unless we want to talk about Social Security\nWhich we could that's what Mitch McConnell wants to do right\nNow wants to go after Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and I got to tell you is if I'm a disinterested party if I'm an actuary just looking at it financially oh yeah I said that's where you have to go\nYou have to well it's really had to literally it's a nightmare it is and and and here's why it is the biggest issue that you have to go after\nIf you will get all the projections not so much today but going forward as to where our spending is going to be it is all going to be heading in that direction over the next Twenty years as we continue to age um so you have\nTo make adjustments to those programs just because they're not sustainable with the way they are set up today the system that was put in place you know originally Seventy years ago now it's simply is not up to date with how long Americans are living in the cost of medical care 'cause the two things that really don't work\nSocial Security is pretty easy to fix to be honest there's not much you need to do in order to fix it ... you can play around the edges\nWe talk just increased the tax or you ... you don't even ... so I can do this I there's a great website I every time we talked Social Security and bring it up there's a website from the committee for a responsible federal budget or called the Social Security reform you can go to yourself and by around\nUh I and it's a think tank I don't know who I I don't know what the case is actively but here's what you can do okay subject all wages to the payroll tax write that covers Seventy two percent of the deficit that Social Security has beyond that\nLimits spousal benefits for high earners okay so if you're in the top twenty five percent of earners you can limit spousal benefits how much does that cover a just four percent I don't need to have animals\nOr if you calculate benefits based on the highest thirty eight years of earning instead of highest thirty five ... that covers an additional eleven percent uh and then the last one that I had there was one or two at least thirty eight years don't they at least men are most most people tend to\nUm and so if you do all of that there's one other thing that I did I Can't find what it was but it wasn't cutting benefits or raising taxes for Ninety percent of people up and it covers one hundred percent of the shortfall okay or Social Security Medicare\nMedicare you can't fix where you just raise the tax rate raise the raise the cost you ... you don't just raise the tax you have to pretty close to double the tax on medical ... that that we raise for Medicare in order to\nCover it we got to do something at some point right in the longer we wait the more painful it's going to be yeah and McConnell I thought you know I I'm not a ... I don't care for McConnell necessarily but he's at least being on a saying hey we have to address these three per and who can't spend all this money on Medicaid\nEvery year either well it it really is a question of how do you fix them if you simply go and cut all the benefits to make the programs work yeah you're gonna end up with an awful lot of unhappy people because now they don't have the benefits that were promised to them so you have to have some kind of compromise here you have to deal with the problems is going to be some combination of raising taxes\nCutting spending and changing al eligibility ages is if you can't do just one 'cause otherwise you anger just a specific group of people my view is always been a good compromise leaves every one upset every everyone has to come out feeling like they lost and if if you do that if you make everyone feel like they lost him you probably did it right\nOur poll question today is do you think we should cut spending on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid you can participate in our poll by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com is there a generational divide on a topic like this they have like how generally speaking\nI can tell you baby boomers are going to say\nWell I don't want you to cut my Social Security benefits and I don't want to pay any more taxes and certainly don't want you to mess with Medicare\nKnow everyone wants to free lunch right you know so there's there's no divided in that sense and that look everyone wants everything to be free you you can't have it you know it's we're getting to the point now where in the next Fifteen Years\nWe're going to have to answer given All right we're not the answer um otherwise we're going to get answered for kind of like when you don't change your oil for twenty or thirty thousand miles yeah it's ... eventually you're going to have to pay for it okay and and we're getting to the point now where you have\nTo make adjustments and I don't think the the adjustments should simply be cutting programs because I think it hangs an awful lot of people out to dry who were depending on those programs\nAnd so we're all going to have to do things that we don't like that that's how you make it work\n... up next we'll be talking about Canada legalizing marijuana it started today this morning the first legal sales of recreational marijuana have occurred this morning in Canada that's our next topic on the financial change your whole\nBreaking financial news usa financial exchange with very Armstrong and trucks on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique\nProducts and cash management services to help you collect rent managed condo association payments and digitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

joining us today Thanks for having me\nShe was what kind of expectations do we have we're we're kicking it off right now with a lot of the financials what kind of guidance are we getting in general for most companies heading into this earnings season\nA guidance was relatively under weak side a and I I'm I mentioned relatively because uh compared to the proceeding three quarter starting with the last quarter of who thousands Seventeen when guide and it really turned up it was a modest me on the on the stock I still estimates\nFor you with three has come down on\nUs in the water got under way\nOr the negative religion wasn't a huge uh but nevertheless was on the negative side\nIn terms of any specific sectors are we getting positive or negative guidance from any sectors in particular on this quarter\nSo well management teams are a lot more effective at a minimum or even if they are not providing specific ah if they have a lot of international if if uh if they are products or services\nIncorporate a lot of elements that are exposed to the ... ah there is there is a fair amount of uncertainty as to what's happening with emerging markets\nA we have heard about the turmoil in currency markets with turkey and some other nations and it's not clear what it meant that he can to and have a bearing on there to grow up and up most of these major American national\nUh they uh they they own substantial portions of their revenues are brought so uh as as does a cross cutter a a A R are not clear that the state that is showing up in management commentary of guidance as well\n[noise] ... as far as um what we're seeing in markets right now the last week has been pretty volatile largely due to inflation concerns and rising interest rates on the back of those inflation concerns\nHave any companies come out and mentioned rising rates as a cause for concern I'm thinking in particular anything housing related or banking or anything out there that potentially guiding differently with regards to interest rates\nAre so so banks are met benefits\nSure he's off of a rising interest rates are all of these major banks have big a mortgage lending operations as well\nBut the bulk of their business or whether it's with corporations or with household benefits or when interest rates go up beat the home builders in the broader a housing vector or that at the receiving end of that friend and a\nNegative for them or there's plenty of other industries sectors that also\nA will most likely be receiving in and we have a negative impact on their bottom line\nOne of the the key friends will be over the last ten years is a very low interest rates have benefited\nCompany or in the interest expenses and a ... he's with which they could borrow with interest rates going up a lot of those companies that spend more on it just it's been and that will have a negative impact on earning\n... we've got to run but thank you for joining us today we appreciate it ...\nFrom ... consumer strong right gig more consumer confidence ... we've ever seen or\nYou know we we've got good numbers there that the point that I always make on consumer confidence and every time we hit records usually something bad happened two years later like I Can't get better way I Can't get that out of my head when it's\nAlso a sentiment statistic meaning how do you feel about the economy as opposed to how many corrugated boxers were bought or how many cars were sold or how many homes were purchased\nYeah my my view is just always think about it you like I Will get just things that are familiar to me so I used to be a soccer player growing up right\nAnd if I had a great game and all of a sudden we won three games you know what I'm saying oh gee everything's great and I and why we run into a buzz saw the next ... you know 'cause it's just you start feeling too good about things and that's where you really need to get nervous because either you get lackadaisical you don't do things are supposed to do\nAnd I just worry about that when when we look at how people feel whenever everyone starts feeling too confident that usually means that the second something goes wrong that

we'll see you know we talked about rising interest rates one of the things that does impact is your ability to buy a house and we ran through the six New England states and Florida\nIn Connecticut Chuck the median home price has two hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars team so to buy that house theoretically you're going to take a mortgage out of a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars\nAt four point nine percent which is where mortgage rates are today that monthly payment is a thousand and Thirteen dollars but if the rates go up and here's what the president's fear is the rate goes from four point nine to six that payment goes from a thousand Thirteen to one thousand one hundred and forty four dollars if the home is still price the same ah which\nThe way I tend to look at it a lot of people and again people do this\nEven though it's I don't usually recommend it ... they buy at the top end of their price range they say hey the banks so that I could borrow three hundred now I'm In a bar or three hundred thousand\nWell if they're doing that in rates go up the banks gonna come back to them and say hey rates went up one percent we can't lend you three hundred grand anymore we can lend to two hundred and Seventy yeah and so if that happens to enough people went a sellers have to eventually say gee we can't get what we thought we were going to for the property and prices come down a little bit it makes it more sustainable I\nI think one of the biggest problems with low interest rates is that ... and it's not talked about a lot what say that you're saving ten percent of your money for home each year and you're making fifty thousand years you're saving five thousand a year five years now you're going to have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved if ... twenty five thousand\nIf rates go down there going to push the price of that property up which means that you're twenty five thousand represents a smaller percentage downpayment so it makes it more difficult for you to buy the place you want because we borrow more\nAlarming is rates are going up and you still have the millennial generation that hasn't bought a house the vast majority of your peers still do not own a home\nWell if you live and mom and dad's house long enough eventually they're going to be gone and you're just stares\nYou know all kidding aside those generationally there this is we've never seen anything like this happen\nTo I don't know about never I Would imagine during the great depression we met in the last four generations you know never see you got to go back to the twenties staff\nYou looked at thirty year olds and their homeownership rates right haven't seen this before\n[noise] you know you have a part of it though if you haven't and the the issue for me is that if you think the fed is going to continue to be easy money in the long run it's a problem because those thirty year old you're gonna get left out of the appreciation that eventually comes in those properties\nSo move as quick as you can because you see they I think what\nI think you can anticipate and this is something I won't know the correct answer for Twenty years but I Would suggest to you folks\nThat inflation is going to run hotter than interest rates and I think the fed is okay with that and they kind of tell you communicated that you know they'll tell you that they want to see inflation running in that two percent range if it ran at three I don't think they'd worry about it I tend to agree\nI mean ... said as much I Know he said that in his last you know they said that he wanted to be you know a little bit more hawkish it sounded like and I know everyone panicked on that earlier this year he said look if we have to run a little bit harder to get to a long term average of two and a two percent inflation will let it run hotter\nIn Florida the median home price was two hundred and twenty four thousand dollars meeting mortgages a hundred and Seventy nine so Chuck in Florida if your mortgage rate went from four point nine six that would be nine hundred and fifty three dollars a month to a thousand Seventy seven dollars a month yeah twenty bucks\nYeah so it ... rising rates are having an impact there is no doubt about it um but I Would make the case in the long run your building more stability and more normalcy back into the market\nI don't think it's a problem what do you make of this story though that Americans are starting to say gee renting is not so bad after all cheaper than owning and I'll tell you once you oh you must be experiencing this you know living through your first year of owning a home yes every weekend right there is money out the door and home repairs and project\nSo there's always stuff going on I got I'm doing a big bold plan this week uh yeah I got a hundred and fifty bulbs then I'm going to be all around the ... are back on the oh yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun I won't be able to move well but yeah\nSo you you've got this uh this jumped now that Seventy eight percent of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning um which is not a great sign if you are someone who's looking to sell a place in the next couple of years 'cause you potentially last buyers that would have come into your you know kind of your orbit\nUm I think that one of the things that is interesting on this is this is the very sentiment that could actually make homeownership more affordable in the long run because if people say look\nThese prices don't make sense and I don't want to be buying I'm not going to buy him not even gonna look no those prices are going to eventually come down and you're going to be able to see people who say hey things have ... it's it's a pendulum swings back and forth 'cause we're not seeing dramatic increases in in mentor airway\nKnowing and we got permits and housing starts this morning that were ... she'll continue slowing um you know the the building that's going on just is not at the level that we want to see it I don't know you know we're still run about twenty percent white as far as what we see in a healthy market\nProbably coming up we're going to be talking about the

Chicago's been known for their union\nTheir unions in the best they have been in so this uh this local union in Chicago a there is one collective bargaining session left a on October twenty fifth and twenty six on the union says hey we're approaching this in good faith\nBut if the company and this is a direct quote from union leadership but if the company continue doing what they did negotiations the last time we met which is basically saying to just a standard do nothing then that's the direction that we're going to move so pretty much they're saying look we want to get a deal done when the company says that there's nothing no changes being made\nIt looks like this Chicago UPS union is going to end up going on strike\nUm and this is eighty five hundred workers in the Chicago area a Chicago is a major hub for you have us try and this isn't something that would just affect the Chicago area this would potentially affect shipping through out the entire Midwest and really all parts of the country\nThey'd have to cover that staffing from other place well and you might find sympathy from other Teamsters and other parts of the country and where they say up to Chicago is going on strike it we won't go on strike but why don't we all call in sick for a few days\nI wouldn't be surprised if you see that I mean this this is\nThis has the potential to be really bad for UPS\nJust does that does a a I I wouldn't be surprised if UPS goes back to the union and says look we need to clean this up especially in light of what Amazon has done [noise]\nRight right to Fifteen bucks an hour you can't have a minimum wage of Thirteen to compete\nAh speaking of which UPS though is going to have something called brown friday that's this Friday October nineteenth and if you're looking for a job should hold at something else they don't like the name it doesn't sound good well brown friday\nOr they're going to meet directly with job seekers and they expect to hire a hundred thousand seasonal employees at these fair skiffs\nAre they're expecting to bring in a one hundred thousand employees pretty much all in one day um where are they going to get him I this is a big my big questions of all these companies that want to hire seasonally I don't know where they're going to find the workers 'cause a lot of the people that they used to be able to get have full time jobs now then so\nI Can't hire illegals because they have to have all kinds of documentation and paperwork\nI think there's going to be real questions here and look to talk about the scale UPS needs to ramp up too they deliver forty million packages of day during peak times forty million packages they it's it's absolutely nuts how crazy it gets a starting in late November So they're trying\nTo wrap this up early I Wonder if any of this Teamsters stuff plays in and I wonder if you have you know people standing outside of these were saying they don't go into like I had heard anything from FedEx either have a much smaller than anything no they usually do I think about forty to fifty thousand\nA year [laughter] by over the last three years thirty five percent of UPS the seasonal hires were given a permanent position when the holidays are over that's pretty good [noise]\nIt is pretty solid I mean again with with these types of jobs to be able to say hey look if I Am in the top you know a third of quote my class that you end up with a full time gig out of it it's not a bad place to be ...
