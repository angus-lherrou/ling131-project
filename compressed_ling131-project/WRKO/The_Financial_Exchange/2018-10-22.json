sort of science complex over there and they ended up buying are winning the auction and uh yeah so the twelve pounds and he said moon rocket that was discovered in Africa and um yes\nOver six hundred thousand dollars they said don't happen just snatch while he's at Bronx\nAnd then what do you do I know\nRight what do you do what I mean is it just to claim hey I got to ... ... what else I mean they probably study it somehow and see\nI don't know there's you know their case or whatever but yeah I've gotten rock you know I mean imagine spending not in Iraq [laughter] that's what blows me away [laughter] and I don't think I Would not imagine spending that Iraq\nAnd by the way I Believe both of you were wearing rocks on your fingers and imagine spending back on [laughter] well I did see I didn't either so I went away [laughter] yeah yeah I guess\nI did did you guys by any chance that this is totally on a different thing but you guys see I'm Melissa ... gets packed in the head of all you see it live I actually just signed into law like when uh the weird thing was when it happened why it happened so quick\nTo everybody in my room was like she could hit with a you know she's really good job and she just kept going for something that came in when a her hard but she got packed wall standing she was actually at the London games and\nShe's been on the sidelines and I don't even know how she I don't even know how the ball would be over where she was skinny or any ball you know there's goof around for a game stuff going on and not paying attention\nHer in the back [laughter] [laughter] that was not good\nNot good you can be ah you can be at risk when you're standing on the sidelines that's for sure especially if you've got your back to the ...\nI think she took one of a front and one time where it was the thing with that one is because they're in the back of my head and you barely see the ball yeah like she put out a funny way to do this hurts more every time I see it but\nAren't Andrew struggling to decide on base one time it was that we know that hurt than she was clearly to shovel because you would be when you take one of the sudden the back of that is like Manhattan smarts but I got to get through visit right\nThey don't want to do is have you ever been hit in the face of\nAll the boil it down like a basketball or baseball or whatever yeah brothers\nAnd with a basket on the face when I was in middle school and I completely just passed out on the ground and like I'm not kidding I Know that I met a girl really are but that basketball and football I think you can uh you know during the sad part is in last year on ... team of girls took one\nHouse right in your blood just all hung out with her nose bleeding you know but all may and that's why I don't disagree with\n[laughter] I don't know I didn't I don't like pain helicopter daughter I met\nI don't know all that I stuck with theater thank you very much warn you Jim one of the way I've been\nDoing some research studies Chang roommate is very common in France and Germany as well as Australia near a bit of a world traveler so be careful when you're over there but you know ... very low in a very very ... very low when\nShe said specifically to be told time magazine I did it to everyone else who just saw yeah\nAll these kids apparently thought it was good the superintendent had a pretty good my drum yeah it's in no way part of his standard died here in the country and for you not to have told us the reading something exotic they can do that on their own time but they're not going to do with your bank you're you're on a one\nOff of there I mean he's right though it's not part of that and you know mom doesn't run to stop and shop and get a roommate regular basis [noise]\nHey we don't leave it right there but I was like a pouch [laughter] I'd rather be back tomorrow\nSo boy so Boston New York about one hundred twenty seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] we're the one\nMorning on Nick ... W. R. Keanu the president of turkey says he's going to go into detail tomorrow in his speech before parliament about the details surrounding the depth of Saudi journalist ... NBC News correspondent ... says so far details released by the Saudis had been checked out\nAnd then it's G I Do need to uh buy a new car yeah let's just tap the equity line why not viewing\nRates are getting high though you know you want to use your home equity like say say you and your wife decide oh we're going to use our home equity to buy a car that six percent interest why couldn't you get a better loan rate than that on the car\nOn your credit quality in some cases you can you know if you've got really good credit you might be able to get a you know a better rate but keep in mind a lot of those teaser rates where they say oh it's you know zero money down in zero percent interest for sixteen months\nYou know that's if you've got the best credit near an awful lot of people that don't necessarily have the best credit so I I think you know when we talk about the higher rates I think that is going to be something in the short term that does have an impact because people are going to look at that and say\nGee it's it's really expensive now like I was looking at my equity one that I have on my house\nAnd just because of how it was set up and how it's tied at seven and a quarter percent hikes you know I'm I'm not so that's a that's something you would use as a last resort\nExactly you know I I have no desire to tap that for the that they're getting my personal perspective I realized that I'm not necessarily\nThe same person that someone news listening to the to the show you do not behaving the same way I Do necessarily so I look at it in my my general point of view when it comes to debt is if you give human beings\nPast due to take that out they will take it\nForty four percent of homeowners between the ages of sixty and Seventy who have outstanding mortgage debt anticipate still having some mortgage debt when they retire didn't used to be that way ... you when you you would\nNot dare retire in the old days you would not dare retire with a mortgage that was like you you have to get rid of the mortgage before he\nRetired [noise] not so much anymore do you think it was easier twenty Thirty years ago the combination of home prices incomes and you know just general principles do you think it was easier to retire without a mortgage in the seventies or eighties\nNow I think people lived in within their means to a different degree you get the older generation they\nHear that the principles I guess it does it and that's you know that's why I come back to the emotional scarring of two thousand eight you know forty years ago truck the people that were paying off their mortgages before they retired yet we're children of the depression\nAnd and they had a different mindset they grew up in the forties and fifties and all they heard about was the great depression and none of them was twenty five so everybody was losing their house\nIt psychologically they were trained to pay off your mortgage as quickly as you can now heck nobody pays off there more people die with mortgages\nAnd and I do think you may be onto something there for at least for that age group my my age group where we're Tucker and I are\nI think our age group is that really negative experiences with debt and also that age group is young enough to be able to make changes in behavior over thirty to forty your time period to change where things are going I think for Generation Next I think for the boomers I I don't think you're seeing any meaningful change in behavior at\nThe snow I like a lot of my friends still have mortgages Harpo question today is\nDo you still have a mortgage and or do you think that you will have a mortgage when you retire and if you are already retired to stay in his answer us honestly do you still carry a mortgage on your house you're you're you're Seventy two years old\nYou been retired for six years or are you still carrying a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar mortgage or a home equity line of credit that that's the other thing I see ... is a lot of people use home equity as a and their lines of credit in retirement years so we'll ... we'll see what the answers come by [laughter]\nWe were talking earlier about mega millions can be one point six billion so we bought tickets for a billion wouldn't we be buying tickets for one point\nSix but you would think so I mean and and keep in mind that one point six I think is going to go up before the uh the jackpot is a is revealed to weekly or make it out twice a week it's a it's Tuesdays and Fridays I Believe\nI'm In and Powerball I think It's Wednesday and Thursday Powerball by the way still has not been one either and that's now up to six hundred and twenty million to get to point two billion dollars now up for grabs on these two jackpots here\nThe I I did the math the other day though so the odds on the mega millions are so bad it's one in three hundred and two million dollars right there one in one of three hundred and two million oh my gosh you think about you know your perspective if you buy twenty million dollars worth of tickets you know you have a one percent chance of winning your odds are still terrible\nYou know and that's true and I are rich [laughter]\nTucker still intermittent [laughter]\nCovers taking his draft Kings' losses enrolling them over into mega millions ...\nHopefully he's not taking his home downpayment fund and putting it in the ... I Hope they don't want to let out but he has his wife has as rock that account up\nI think about how nice of a house you'd be able to buy for one point six billion dollars\nYou know what I look at it ever know food to I don't know it's a one point six so there'll be a drawing tomorrow night\nIf it's going to be tomorrow night one point six by the way the funny thing on this so you drive past any of the stores that have the mega millions and you know there was the jackpot and hey here's how much is available it can't was how much is available because only has three digits [laughter]\nAnd so just every single one just has nine hundred and Ninety nine million dollars if it doesn't actually say one point six billion ... the system is not built to deal with it\nWe suckers are born every minute hey coming back to talking about rolling blackouts in New England is that something we have to worry about going forward John ... from the Boston Globe wrote an article that well I'll tell you what it it got me to read it we'll talk about rolling blackouts when we return your whole\nBreaking financial news of financial exchange with Barry Armstrong and trucks on the financial exchange radio network\nHi this is very Armstrong amazingly over twenty percent of Americans have said nothing for\nTheir retirement can you imagine you're sixty five and you haven't saved a nickel hopefully none of you listening today are in that boat but whatever you save for retirement I'd like to help you devise a strategy that will allow you to enjoy your later years my new guide out this month will help you learn strategies to help manage your portfolio and protected so that when it's time for you to retire your assets\nCan be there to work for you retirees have to worry about a lot of things where your money last kinda cover your expenses if you don't know the answers to these questions called me right now at eight hundred three nine three\nFour zero zero one request a copy of this brand new guide how to develop a retirement income strategy that's eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one or download it right now on our website Armstrong advisory dot com\nSecurities offered the securities America incorporated remember finger essay PC and advisory services offered their security is American advisors incorporated very Armstrong representative Armstrong advisory group in the securities America companies are unaffiliated\nSmelled treading on W.

you you iron that out\nI Do have a house so problems [laughter]\nThat's all they don't get out there you go back to\nTheir ego uh this retirement expense has hit one hundred thousand dollars annually and it's continuing to rise we're talking about the cost of care we're talking about assisted living facilities and we're talking about specifically nursing homes cost of this stuff is just going through the roof\nAnd the median cost of a private room in a nursing home is about a hundred thousand a year that obviously is being nationwide cost ... when you talk about the cost in the northeast and it really anywhere on the east coast anywhere not in the middle of the country you're talking significantly higher than that\nUm and so this is one of the biggest things that I think people\nDon't necessarily have a clear plan for just because\nIt's really hard to plan for a hundred thousand dollars a year that you're going to be spending on something like this and a lot of cases choices not very many people that can afford it no I mean you look at what most people have saved you know they might have a couple of hundred thousand dollars total and so if each spouse to end up spending a year or two in a nursing home they can wipe out the entire state in in the blink of an ...\nYou know the er I've gone through this process with family members and\nDie recently had a family member that is going through now they're not in the New England area they're out in Arizona but the cost of it is about four hundred thousand to buy in much of that four hundred thousand dollars those tax deductible okay All right so you get a big tax deduction for the four hundred thousand dollar up front and this is not a nursing\nHas one of those aging place ... where they have different levels of care that you gradually move up to\nIt is so and and the four hundred thousand as non refundable you're out like it's when you die it that that's gone you get in on that and the family gets none of that four hundred thousand dollars jak okay and then\nYou're paying a hefty fee every month you're paying you know upwards of six seven thousand dollars a month part of which again is going to be tax deductible too\nDo you think there's anything out there that ever bend the cost curve on this in order to make it more affordable 'cause you know ... years I've done the math like people say oh gee I Can't believe that you know a nursing home costs Fifteen thousand dollars a month or something I mean you do the math and you say okay first of all\nHow much would you pay to live in a hotel room on a nightly basis you'd say okay\nIf it's you know kind of a middle of the road if you're looking you know what the average person in the country pays call it a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a month or a night I'm Sorry so right off the bat you're somewhere in the ballpark of forty five hundred six thousand dollars a month and then you need food then you need care and so\nI just I look at it and I sit there and I go I don't know what you can ever do to bend\nThat downward and they live on a cruise ship it's cheaper called ... have you ever seen stories about that no I mean you're living on cruise ships soy permanently permanently they moved away is that right they they'll live on a cruise ship and it's less expensive than one of these facilities that I'm Talking about the reason the costs for these facilities are so high\nIs a I have a client that was running one and if you look at the amount of regulations that they have to go through both federal and state regulations it's all regulatory the costs they they they could provide\nCare at a much lower cost but it wouldn't be at the level mandated by the states and that's why you go out west truck if you go out to Kansas and you compare the cost of a nursing home or health care facility in Kansas as compared to the northeast\nAnd the love of it I\n... about\n\nEric Clapton arrogant dominoes and releases

about Seventy seven five overall\nAnd doing rotten tomatoes Tucker you look it up but it has an eighty percent prominent rotten tomatoes ... Seventy percent of the audience liked it so pretty even they're\nPretty good there but it does look like there's some absolutely terrible movies coming out this week so I think Halloween is likely to remain strong especially you\nKnow we had no that would not get all the way how lose a weekend of all the Halloween parties right be Saturday I mean I yeah I'm going to want it\nSaturday yeah and uh the movie's coming out this week and looked absolutely terrible uh so I anticipate it's going to end up staying in that top spot there\nThat you pay Fifteen bucks just to go get scared the\nDickens

they brought like a lot of the journal back and everything but ah yeah continues to uh do very well by the way do you remember um a couple when was it I'm trying to remember\nIt was a couple of months back you remember the a crazy Rich Asians movie yeah yeah yeah ... do you know we had talked about hey you know how well as this movie going to do with a bunch of thirty million but it had really strong back to back weekends and so forth\nIt's pretty much closed up at this point but it did two hundred and thirty one million dollars to thirty million dollar thirty million dollar budget huge

though there is more now with the streaming services there is more that you know ends up happening\nUm but it was you know really good one for Warner Brothers there just because they were a studio that you know had struggled to kind of find any voting this year in crazy Rich Asians is their best performing movie in the United states this year\nWell very profitable labor force participation among prime age us women\nTwenty five to fifty four has risen to Seventy five point two percent from Seventy three point three percent three years ago what can we learn from that what what's the what's the lesson to be learned from an increased number of women in that age group working\nThink there's there's two things that I really gleaned from it number one uh I think that the cost of\nRunning a household today is much higher than it was previously and so you have more families with two spouses working at the number one\nUh the second piece is that we have not seen a similar bounce back for men over that time span\nIn as a result I think you look at that and you say why are you know that it raises more questions for me and that\nWire men not coming back into the workforce at the same rate is a drug addiction I'm sure that the well I so I don't know because I don't know of drug addiction more men are addicted to drugs and I'm Talking about the opioid crisis if you look at the number I haven't seen the numbers of how how ...\nLike I I'm going to\nBut I don't want to I don't want to put it out there but I have a going from memory and that memory is failing but I Know a lot more men\nDie from the opioid addiction than women because I'm working I'm pulling up the numbers right now so if we look at the males age yet middle age twenty five to fifty four is pretty much flat over the last three years you know it's up slightly from about ... ... yeah so we're about one percent\nWhat does this do to the birth rate the fact that more women are they going back to work because they had kids and they need money to pay for college or are they simply not having\nKids and that's why there's more women I don't know if you can glean enough from this data to be able to say that now you know I it it's really hard to be able to say when this is happening just because it ...\nIt's not happening just in the United states either this is going on in Canada Australia in the

that is let's see I'm trying to the top five Ninety three point five percent so there's about six and a half percent of people that are going to be affected\nBy this they just means that you know next paycheck you're you're paying that fake attacks and it's a big tax\nIt's a flat tax it is if if you're self employed you're paying all the twelve point four percent if you are employed by a company you pay six point two percent in the company pays six point two percent as well people forget that you know they they talk about tax rates right they say Oh nice\nMy tax rates thirty five percent ... forty one percent got a factor that in you know and then they forget about the state well you've got thirty five percent is another five ... to the state mhm in most cases not Florida\nA normal retirement age is ...\nThe racing by two months that's just that's part of the I think that went into effect in the Nineteen nineties where they pushed out the retirement age\n[noise] yeah it was one of the things that they did in order to make the program more sustainable it's going to be something they have to do again if they want to you know deal with the funding issues are that the trust fund has or rather is going to have in about fourteen years now\nYou know we can make a little bit more money and those of you who collect your Social Security early you can earn a little bit more money without suffering reduction in your benefit in those early years you know sixty two to sixty Seventy\nF you retire before full retirement age will now be able to earn Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars a year up from Seventeen thousand forty uh that's what you'd be able to earn with out it affecting your benefit\nGreat question that a lot of people have actually look if you're retiring in a given year let's say you retire in July of that year a lot of people have a question hey can I earned income prior to that that's an excess of that\nThe answer is yes now if you are turning full retirement age and twenty Nineteen and you can earn up to forty six thousand nine twenty in the months prior to turning normal retirement age but if you were in more than that\nThan Social Security with old one dollar for every three dollars above the limits\nA lot of money a lot of money by us shale has a glaring problem this is one this and unfortunately our friends in Saudi Arabia are aware of this yeah we're producing a lot of oil in the United states I think we're we're the largest producer in the world now her for a second largest ... read\nProbably depends on the given week but we're right in the ballpark yeah problem is we're losing money doing it well it's as though here's what's interesting is in particular this was looking at a review of thirty three quote publicly traded oil and gas fracking companies so this is just companies that are involved\nIn oil and gas fracking not companies that are uh you know just have that as a portion of their business but purely ones that do that\nAnd what it found um were that these thirty three companies posts they combined three point nine billion dollars in negative cash flow in the first half of twenty Eighteen ...\nNegative cash flow in the short term doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be negative in the long run is that because you get a lot of ... or a lot have a lot of ... they didn't break it out really so it's hard to say where it's coming from ... um but it's it's something that I think could be a little bit of a red herring just because\nIt could be that they're just investing a ton of money right now because they think oil prices are going to continue to move up for it and so\nI'm curious to see what this looks like on a consistent basis just you know obviously we've seen this report here\nWhat was it a year ago what was it two years ago you know is is this something that's changing here you know because companies are adding so much capacity in the U.S right now we've seen us to pass the\nBill for about eight and a half million barrels a week up to eleven million or a day rather up to eleven million barrels a day over the last two and a half years it could just be they're adding a ton of capacity and that's what's going on here\nStill distribution issue ultimately though isn't it they we we either don't have the ports are we don't have the pipelines to get it where we need it because we theoretically we shouldn't be exporting any oil if we had enough pipelines to get it where we needed because a lot more profitable to export [noise]\nYeah but it should it ever be more ... like if you think about where we can export it to her to export to China why should we have to ship it all the way to China shouldn't it be less expensive to send it to the northeast by pipeline than shipping it to China and a barge what\nThey think it is less expensive that's why you ship it to China instead because the more profitable because again they're they're China is now the biggest I understand her of oil in the world they have the demand and they don't have the production understand and they need to be able to pay for\nThis or either going me your your producer because most of our oil is coming from the Permian Basin Texas right oh it's\nIt's scattered I mean you've got big deposits now that are showing up in like in Colorado you've got to know that ... production though is if it's a large income and I think that's about thirty percent that's in Texas\nSo you got your biggest slug coming out of there and we're still importing between what we buy from Canada and in our friends in the middle east we're still importing a good seven million barrels a day yeah so why is my point is if if you had\nA distribution system would you really need to be exporting at all but ... what is it wouldn't you be better oh you mean\nBy distribution system pipelines well how do you think the oil is getting to the ports\nIt is ... ... the ... we can't get natural gas to the northeast and we get oil to then\nOr now I guess is a different issue so I think when when we look at\n... gas that's a very separate issue that local to the northeast and and that's because we haven't built pipelines\nBut if you look at how you know oil flowing around most of the country right now it's it's not a pipeline issue to get it to most places aside from the northeast now you know the northeastern isolated issue but it's of its own making you know they they do because we won't allow the pipelines that's the big thing if you look at the entire rest of the country they don't have the same issue so\nI don't hate coming up we're going to tell you why you should no longer put your vodka in the freezing I thought everybody put their vodka in the freezer has just like what you're supposed to do ...

I mean you could go down the list and pretty much said from Toyota there's no one who's anywhere near that market cap you know Toyota is a I Believe one hundred twenty billion dollar company or somewhere in that ballpark but this is why I think talking about these kinds of evaluations or not you know\n... whether it's you you we if Samantha ... could is it a hundred and twenty billion is a hundred and\nBut if it's going to be a big number when they go public it's gonna be a very very large number of next year where do you think the ...\nThat's the question 'cause he lives there and they're talking crazy numbers they're hoping that Facebook was the same way Facebook when they went public arrows at all\nIt was just suckers that everybody on CNBC and blue or I don't buy it will look at it now somebody you don't you can't put a face for you can't point to Facebook because they are the exception that proves the rule and okay you will get the company like think about every other tech company to admit I peeled in the last decade now Twitter sucked\nFitbit suck in a way to go who else is at least there's no doubt that was like every other young like everybody uses rubber I mean it's unbelievable how many people had fitbit so like I I get that but that doesn't mean it's worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars like\nJust saying oh well everyone uses is now they don't make money now like the idea but investors believed that they will but that doesn't matter like event actually\nThat's how I get the hundred and twenty billion dollar value and how that worked in the tech bubble depends you know it it's probably only companies that are better than a lottery ticket ... [laughter] but this is the\nPoint that I'm trying to make is we're now in the ... at the point where we are comparing this to a lottery ticket no that's not an investment that's gambling well and so I look at it over and everyone says all this the future\nWhat do they do know what what do they do it it's hard on anyone else their car companies are scrambling the only car company in my estimation that seems to have invested a substantial amount of capital in it and really understands that side of the businesses General Motors and their stock isn't doing a darn thing hit their stocks down\nAnd and that's why I say this isn't worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars if the car companies that are actually doing this aren't getting the same boost got it than all Wall Street selling his crap you\nKnow wouldn't be the first time a cycle it got to change the psycho score is again and having cash in the bank is going to help your credit score which is smart\nYeah pretty much what they're doing is uh they're rolling out a this new method of scoring\nUh in in the next year so we don't have an exact rollout date yet just because we don't have all the information on how this program is going to work um but pretty much a psycho is in discussions with a bunch of lenders\nTo put out what's called the quote ultra psycho score and so what is going to do it's going to take into account cash transactions that happened inside bank accounts as a way to potentially boost up people's credit scores\nPreviously might not qualify for certain types of loans so there's a lot of people that don't use credit cards and when they go to buy a car they pay cash exactly and so those are the people that this is going to target is you know kind of that group that yeah they they're still in the banking system but they don't use a ton of credit products now and because of that they don't have the quote credit history\nThat most other people might have and so this is something that is going to provide a significant boost for those folks if you already have good credit probably doesn't do a ton to help or hurt you either way but if you are someone who hasn't used credit a lot and\nHe really just primarily been using debit cards and cash transactions and things like that it is going to be useful for you if that's the case for you\nFolks do you want to trust to protect your assets if not and if you closing in on retirement\nAnd this message is for you\nPlanning for retirement can be complicated so it's best to deal with an expert who can advise you on the many elements that will affect the process including how to keep your assets of probate and protect them from the nursing home Todd ... he's a partner with a law firm of cooking and do and\nHe's also an expert an elder law and his new guide out this month will help you understand how to design an era vocal trust\nAnd it'll also include the exact language you need in order to protect your assets from probate and the nursing home the guy does yours\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine ... radio show the legal exchange he always discussions issues that can affect you in later life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Boston", "day": "22"}
