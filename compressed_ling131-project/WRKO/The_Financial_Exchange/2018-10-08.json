his third houses is huge mansion and there was there that he allowed to clear and I can see you with an axe\nRob and I mean like the way that they're describing this is like a it's an eight dollar acts for people that go camping and there are really ... kind of things that aren't used to using an axe falls to come All right if no one's stuff that you had him up for the acts he acts can\nDo to a risk that the acts head can detached from the handle posing a serious risk for injury\nI get to you but now with an accidental in there on the side of caution\nNo max stuff is bad for the last word

CNBC this morning global deal making appetite is fall into a four year low a mid ... that China trade fears et cetera\nUh only forty six percent of global executives over the next twelve months are planning to buy or merge with another company which is pretty low in terms of historically what we've seen\nYeah temp down by ... percentage points from a year earlier so that's you know it definitely a dramatic shift or of course you know you have seen a you know a lot of big deals going through the sky deal Comcast\nComing in to pick them up a bear and Monsanto you know at some point you sort of wonder just how many deals are they're left out there to do I mean I suppose every single day there's some deal to do but you know if we've come through a period of a really aggressive him in a and you know if we knew the answer to this we\nMake a billion dollars you know we'll things are in the economy in the stock market be better twelve months from now than they are now I think you know there's a reason to to have doubts about how much longer kind of the good times we've seen can keep going yeah\nCertainly I mean that that is a risk I you know the big executives are cited regulation and geo political uncertainty as the biggest\nRisks and concerns they have to deal making\nYou know the other side is some of the theory is hey if you're going to be heading into a period of slowing or you know economic recession you want to be big and you have some consolidation seeking whether that storm so two sides of the coin but\nA clearly a lot of geo political and economic uncertainty out there and you're seeing is this is one of those early indicators that we see out there you know if people aren't willing to shell out cash for other companies\nThat begins to become a concern when compiled with other issues\nAnd sort of another version of that is are people waiting in thinking some people are gonna get beaten up in the next twelve twenty four months and you might be able to make better deals in twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nDerby not to mention you know probably costs you another one or two percent in interest to borrow the money to acquire these companies now so that doesn't help either\nSwitching gears a little bit away from China uh although probably a lot of these things were a manufactured in China the retailer mattress from going bankrupt over the over the weekend match for him which operates over three thousand stores across the country declaring bankruptcy sounds like ... seven hundred locations going dark almost immediately\nHave you ever seen anybody going into or walking out of a mattress from\nI went into one once ah\nI actually don't remember if it was a mattress firmer one of the new identical other stores that sell mattresses it seems like there's twenty on every street corner that you want and that you see in you know any of the major cities I'm\nA yeah it's it was a weird place um the number of people that are buying matches on line now and the number of expansions that that that this company had done just didn't seem to add up to me yeah it is not terribly surprising that I'm seeing this company going out of business\nBecause I go by a couple of every day and this got me thinking about I've never seen anybody going into a mattress store and you know these days or what a better product ... get it delivered to your house lie down on it if you don't like it return it\nYeah so I my my wife bought one of these ah online matched I don't remember which company she used it as a group on deal five years ago we ordered it we actually really liked it but\nThinking about that ... that return process that wouldn't be very pleasant if we had to return it I mean first off yet that whole that two hundred pound box up three flights of stairs into our south the apartment south Boston apartment that was miserable [noise]\nUm and then if we had to bring that same back down I genuinely don't know how we would have done it ... that that tiny ... all the way and saw it might have involved the chain saw on a window\nSo I see the appeal to buying them ashes on line and clearly a lot of people are doing it because they're sending companies like mattress from right out of business\nOn that actually brings me to our poll questions today which is up on financial exchange show dot com you can come vote I Want to see how many people\nAre not even if you have purchased a match sound like but you know anyone who is bought an actress on line because I think you know most of our listeners probably going to say no to this is not a purchase you make frequently but do you know anyone who has bought a mattress on line I'm it yes 'cause my wife to tend to have you bought a matched on line do you know anyone who has\nA there are about ... go right to Jordan's or something you have less less matched up I was like two years ago I just wanted to Jordan's they deliver to form and you pay more though I may you pay more for Jordan's mattress then you will on an online retail I I think you can save thirty forty percent\nBy going for one of these on line mattress companies from what I've heard\nAnd then you have the nightmare of getting it up to the third floor the south the apartments yeah ... yeah that that was pretty much should've had your friends over and then uh gotten the pizza\nIsn't the way we are not as gullible as they used to be [laughter] ... have you bought a national I Am not a gun\nOr it may in fact it makes me wonder I think that our mattress is probably seven years old at this point

[noise] moving over to\nA more international stories we've had the sanctions on Iran snapping back to the last few months now and we had a similar story on friday\nAbout how few European countries were trying to get around to the new U.S sanctions that were placed on but\nMost of the European companies a big you know ... the French oil company and most of the banks won't touch it because the second they know that they you know if they defy one of these us sanctions and they're going to be pretty much prohibited from doing business with the U.S bank\nUm but India has said that they are going to continue to import the oil from the from the Iranians India the third largest ah oil importer in the world\nI Will be very interested to see how you know who won the White House react to this yeah this will not go over very well\nNow I probably won't do generally speaking what we've done with other countries is you know will allow them to wean themselves off of Iranian oil as long as they commit to not importing anymore going forward so you know bring those Iranian oil imports down to zero that doesn't seem to be with India saying here\nThere's an interesting uh Pete line in the CNBC story about this uh India Iran oil situation\nOr the very end of the story they say some energy marketing analyst expect around five hundred thousand barrels per day to disappear once us sanctions against Iran come into forest while others have warned as much as two million barrels per day could come up line in other words experts have no idea what's going to happen and you know how much of these\nSanctions gonna bite and how much can Iran cheat and who's going to college with them\nAlways just seeps out of the country they you'd put sanctions on there you try and get it you know to stay in the country and not get export it always finds a way out to do is pretty sketchy but it always does seem to find a way out or you probably will see a price impact I mean you've already seen a bit of a price impact on rising price of oil because of this\nMy concern centers around how these countries are going to do it because\nIf China if Russia is India if parts of Europe get together and say hey we're going to you know forget about the United states new sanctions or there was a deal in place and we're going to abide by the prior deal and still do business with Iran\nThen they would have to do so in a currency other than the u._s. dollar\nAnd that's my concern is yeah this is just one independent scenario here but right now everything is traded in dollars oil being the main thing I everybody pays dollars for oil if all of a sudden you get that to change and suddenly people are paying you know Chinese run for for oil\nThat could have a big ripple effect down you know down the line as maybe the u._s. dollar gets replaced as the default currency for trait that would be really very ...\nAnd it's an awfully good thing when your currency is the world's reserve currency\nNew I mean we are we we are the most reliable currency out there\nAnd I don't think that this one event is going to change that you know this one event in Iran is not going to completely change that but when you compound this with potentially other issues down the road\nThat's where you could have some concerns about you know will the u._s. currency will the dollar still be in the same place a decade from now compared to where it is today that I don't know but it might be nothing but uh it it raises some concern\nWe had a big election uh over the weekend on Sunday and Brazil there was a very very

that big in one week and you know as you pointed out have really been around two point eight percent for most of the summer so\nYou know it's one of those sort of bad news good news things 'cause to me the reason the interest rates going up is because the economy's doing well and the fed can raise the interest rate and um you know we're seeing some uh I Would say a for now fairly positive signs of inflation growth so\nYou know uh every uh every piece of economic data you can argue is good or bad yeah I mean we did get so we\nGot a a jobs report on friday and you know the reiterated

two point eight percent but if you look at the last\nQuarter by quarter we've been getting faster and faster here so I think there are some legitimate concerns that the fed has\nAbout inflation or as as you see interest rates and that's the reaction is they're moving up interest rates but wage growth is the big one that we've been looking at and uh if there's one thing that I think you really need to keep the stock market and the U.S economy afloat for another few years it's going to be it's gonna be coming from the consumer\nIt's got to come from the American consumer make it a little bit more money and spending that money on things like cars like toys like all that ah you know all that uses joke that we don't need but that keeps our economy floating Seventy percent of the economy you write me and everybody spending\nA so speaking of interest rates last decade you know if you wanted to go buy a new car you can get a pretty sweet deal on financing zero percent financing deals really came about right after the the great recession all these car companies said well we got to sell these car somehow so how do we do it will get them in with zero percent financing lot harder to find these days\nWhen I was amazed when you started seeing you know zero percent for one year three years or ... you know great deal but when you start seeing Seventy two month zero interest loans I mean that's really a the ... the lender taking a major risk about what's the future going home\nYeah I mean I Would do is Seventy two months a loan on a car if I had zero percent but you really got to think about

two months goes by I mean I I Try and drive my car is into the ground but a ... if you do a fair bit of driving in a pretty good chance you're gonna have to replace that car for six years goes by\nYeah and then you've got a big uh you know or you get the total than the other way\nAround that car pretty quickly yeah\nI'm ... those deals are going away if you see is zero percent financing deal on a car uh usually it's for a couple of reasons one that's just something that can't sell any more so\nYou're ... you're still seeing some of these deals on you know smaller size sedan that just aren't selling very well right now you know everybody wants to small SUV sedans just aren't really going to they're putting some decent financing deals on those\nUm but they're really by and large have gone away this zero percent financing\nWell these Judy power numbers or two years ago nine point one percent of all new cars could sold with the the zero interest loan\nNow is just three point

is a lot of confusion these days about the health insurance marketplace\nNow have you got an employer and you know they're covering your health insurance that's pretty simple it's not trying to not civil trying to figure out what's covered in how much is going to cost\nBut at least you know what you're expected the pay is pretty simple but with the rollout of the Affordable CARE Act and then the you know the changes that were made the Affordable CARE Act a law has been changing over the last few years\nAnd now there's these almost like GAP insurance policy that you can go out there and by short term short term insurance or you know they were designed to really only cover insurance for a period of three months if you're in between jobs or something like that\nUm but they are now being sold on a longer term basis they can be really cheap you know as much as fifty to eighty percent cheaper than plans available and Affordable Care act but as we're learning new yard you know specifically very different from what we think of as your typical health insurance plans\nAnd I mean they're completely terrible this a story that we're looking at from a CNBC you know ten thousand dollar deductibles coverage a pre existing conditions no prescription drug coverage no subsidies uh you know you can't renewed them to you go from one provider to another\nAnd I get to the end of the story and I said you know why would you even pay for the coverage of the first place it seems like you're better off just not even going totally uncovered\nI think what this type of thing I disagree with you a little bit there I mean what if you really do your research what this is covering you for is somebody that says hey I don't want health insurance but if I have a heart attack I don't want to go bankrupt they're basically saying if if you have to have an emergency really expensive procedure it's going to cover that\nBut it's going to have a pretty much nothing else there is a pre existing conditions you won't even be approved for the health insurance and the first place so don't worry about it\nUm it doesn't cover prescription drugs largely a sky high deductible your I talked about that a ten thousand dollars duck doubles\nThe other thing I didn't realize though so if you buy one of these policies and then it expires because they're you know three months policies you can't just go back and buy an Affordable Care act policy if you get rid of one of these policies you have to wait until the open enrollment period\nA which is actually over one day come here yeah um the other thing too is there's subsidies available or if you're in an Affordable Care act policy these types do not offer subsidies\nSo you do it it's tough these days\nYou really do need to research this I actually talked to a guy ah just last week who was running a small business he had been in corporate America for years\nStarted a small business really you know the the politics of the Affordable CARE Act really rubbed in the wrong way so he just wasn't carrying any health insurance up until that point and it didn't really ... it didn't really seemed to click like\nYeah I mean if I if I get in a car accident uh if I you know if something like out in LA I'll lose my house I'll lose anything that I have because you know any visit to the emergency room these days costs thousands of dollars um now I I hadn't had a client who had a heart transplant\nThe bill to the insurance companies one and a half million dollars wow what would you do if you I mean if you didn't have health insurance area you're just toast ... and he was in the hospital for two months\nAre all sorts of prescriptions and that's the other thing right you know yeah this will cover the heart transplant the basic insurance policies but how about all the prescriptions that you have to be on for the rest of your life that this this health insurance is going to cover all that yeah the interesting\nTo see the the last time we saw at the end of twenty sixteen they're about a hundred and sixty thousand people in America who had a these short term uh coverage plans will be interesting to see the the updated number you know it's just getting the maybe five hundred thousand or or even a million now\nThe penalty goes away now you don't have to pay a penalty if you don't have health insurance so I think a lot of people are gonna drop off and it's a big bill ... if if you earn ... let's say you're a small business owner you're you know just a independent contractor and you make a decent wage you're for you know a decent Affordable Care act policy you're shelling out\nEight hundred thousand bucks a month for just an individual family plan two thousand and four hundred yeah it's big big money I get why people don't have insurance it's really really costly but are you really need to think through the implications if you're not going to carry health insurance\nFolks do you have a trust to protect your assets if
