{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And that maybe someone you don't know with their hands who that would be in and basically the court will say who that will be if you don't do a will and also\nUm you want your belongings to go to different you know the people you want them to go to and not the state says it will go to if you don't have a will so\nIt's very important to do that again it doesn't really have a lot of legal significance until you pass away but you want to have that because you want to make sure things go to who you want\nAnd how you want and much shares\nAs some of 'em you know feel when it always seems to me your statistics are related a lot to the idea that people just don't want to stay there mortality right\nOh no one wants to talk about it you know as human beings we're we're afraid to face that type of thing we don't want to think about dying so we we do all sorts of different things that you know if I don't know if you ever saw that commercial where they say we have to do some retirement planning and they're going well I got a I have to I have to change the oil I have to do this\nEveryone tries to avoid it that's kind of funny um but you really shouldn't be avoided and uh I'll tell you every time we do this when someone does it they leave and say oh my God I feel so much better that I'd get this done 'em and it's something you don't have to think about it anymore and I'm telling you will have peace of mind after you do it\nAnd it's not that bad of a thing to do it's pretty easy to get fun anyway\nGood for you I I Know that you do and you know it's not just it's just not yeah your mortality that you're thinking about the power of attorney and healthcare proxy as well you want somebody to be able to speak on your behalf if you need that kind of help or should you be hospitalized or in in capacity in some way\nAnd I always say those two documents a durable power of attorney which is a document that if you become incapacitated and you can't make legal and financial decisions for yourself at a health care proxy if you become incapacitated and you can't make medical decisions for yourself\nExtremely important documents and the reason for that is if you don't have a durable power of attorney someone that can make those legal financial decisions for you\nWhen you have to go to the pro big court we have to start a guardianship and a conservative ship and it's a full blown call to action\nAnd we're running into court asking the judge listen we want to sell this we want to do this and we have to get permission from the court to do that if you don't have a power of attorney so it's a very important document you want to make sure that your family is controlling\nYour your assets and your your financial affairs if something happens to you know not not the court ...\nSo that durable power of attorney is an extremely extremely important document and the and\nThe health care proxy and everyone goes yeah yeah yeah yeah healthcare proxy but it's extremely important because if you don't have won the state takes over and they're going to be making decisions basically for you we'd have to go get the guardianship\nA done again full blown caught action get someone in there to make your medical decisions for you it might not be someone you'll like\nI'm not the person you would have picked 'em and again very expensive as an attorney involved in the corridors involved and that's a that's a relatively simple document to get done 'em\nAnd it's very important very powerful you want to make sure that it's done\nAnd then is called a living will now have you heard about these ... yes I have actually yeah then and this is the one everyone confuses with the with the health care proxy\nIt says listen if I'm terminally ill no hope of recovery you know brain that I'm not coming back that you either want to be on machines are off machines\nAnd you can pick all sorts of different things if I'm In this circumstance you know make sure you do this and it you giving your healthcare proxy direction on what to do in certain circumstances\nSo what's what's important is you know there isn't a child in the world that ever wants to take a parent off life support and if you don't have that document and they do have to do that to you know there's a lot of guilt associated with something like that\nAnd that living will you say hey listen son daughter if I'm In this circumstance make sure this happens so you take all your alleviate all that guilt you take it away from the child and they're just carrying out your wishes they're not making the actual decision which is a really nice thing to have\nIt certainly is a it's a very um a caring and giving thing to do we're talking with a elder law attorney\nToo am a roof from the commonwealth advisory group now Phil you frequently combine your advice for state planning with retirement planning was rubbing on laying a and Susan ... is always

I think in January February even before then cold you know it starts to ramp up and so\nMy guess as to what ends up happening here is I think the union is going to lose on the pension plan do just 'cause I I don't think that like you'd ever companies getting rid of them I think they lose on that I think they get some concessions on healthcare\nBut they so far it may vary according to the union they'd made very little progress they are they they've had a dozen meetings and they'd been cordial\nBut but in a virus\nYeah I Hope it doesn't seem like they're getting anywhere so we'll see if they can get a deal but again yeah go ahead for months a paycheck eventually some of these guys have to be getting any of\nThat I'd jobs you know they're skilled worker so they could be maybe they're doing side jobs\nWith some kind of take could maybe they're working on that Columbia gas pipeline well in part of it you almost wonder if you know obviously you know their union workers you wonder if some other you know union jobs gigs or you know having them some work saying hey you know we know you're in a tough situation where we can help you out\nWe'll see we'll see I voted early today because I'm going to be out of town on election day but sounds like early turnout is rampant across the country\nYeah the numbers are pretty staggering I'm going to be a voting later today actually why you're doing it early just 'cause I don't want to wait in lines on voting day there's you have lines yeah I've I've just I don't want a chance it and you know I've never voted where I Am right now I only moved to a year ago the suburbs you don't have lines to say no that's that's good to know I just want to get it done then\nBut yeah you're you're seeing a early voting turnout in some cases in particular Indiana you up early voting turnout almost identical to presidential election year levels in terms of normally you know significantly more quiet as far as the overall numbers that you see there\nDo we know whether one side is more fired up then the other is you you know you get more Republican showing up more Democrats showing up to vote early and does it matter like does it cause usually you only get about a quarter of the eligible voters that vote and bitter\nSkin it depends on the state and it depends on the count you know it's like ... there's different trends depending on exactly where you go so\nI don't know if you can glean any you know results from this as far as oh early turnout stuff that is good for group acts it really depends on the specific race non specific candidates that are out there in a lot of cases for what is the polling indicate right now in terms of outcome if we're talking most likely outcomes out there you're\nMost likely outcome is that you see the house they were or I'm Sorry the house go Democrat and you see the ... they are even really unclear and here's here's why it's so unclear is that if you look at one of the best predictors of how things are going to end up playing out it's what we called the generic ballot which is\nHey water voters preferences just for Republicans or Democrats\nAnd a two or three points swing either way from where the polling is has a massive effect is based on kind of how things are set up right now so if you see things end up two or three percent more Republican\nYou could have Republicans keep the house and the Senate pretty easily actually if it goes two or three percent more Democrat ... winning a wave in the house and might even pick up a Senate seat to do which is a case where Dems\nDon't take you don't see the Dems taking the Senate in under any circumstance\nIt's ... there's maybe a five to ten percent chance that I think they do but I think it's really really unlikely usually die for thirty eight saying it's one out of seven I'd say it's lower than that I fear smart though so that kind of know what they're doing our\nQuestion today is do you vote early I did vote early and I participated in the poll you can participate in the bull by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com deal vote early I'd be curious if the end results are that you have higher turnout I I don't know the answer is do we 'cause it's usually about a quarter\nOf eligible voters registered voters that vote so in the presidential election I think it's about half right\n[noise] uh I'm pulling the numbers all I Need to dig out you get into that and when a\nPrep the next segment which is regarding a new drug for the flu it's flu season folks there's a new drug available for the first

just the last Twenty years 'cause you know it's kind of the relevant period\nWe've been anywhere on the low end in Nineteen Ninety six fifty one point seven percent on the high in two thousand eight sixty one point six percent so generally around fifty five percent if we look at mid term elections going back to let's call it Ninety\nYeah we'll go back then as ... as well uh we're anywhere between

I think that we're going to continue to feel some pain\nOr possibly right up till Christmas maybe beyond but uh I I just don't feel like the markets are convinced that the worst is behind a Sega they want to go\nWell I I tend to agree and I was talking to someone yesterday and and the point that we raised in that conversation so\nHistorically if you look at market correction is defined as being a ten percent more or more drop in markets you know you see one of those on average every sixteen Seventeen months there really common you see those a lot\nOf the question is in the question that people have is look is this heading towards a barrel mark and defined as a correction or a dip of twenty percent more and more okay in the case of that I made us look market correction they're effectively ... they are test of the market to see whether or not the economy is strong enough to support current stock prices are normal ...\nBeer markets occur when the economy is not strong enough to support market valuations its windows tests failed ... that's what you get when those market corrections windows tests fail there\nIn this case when you look at it the one that we had earlier this year which again it was a ten percent correction it was a test and the data came back over the next few months and they said\nHey we're still seeing an acceleration in gross yeah we're seeing wage growth inflation's tame everything looks good to go\nOkay fine continue on on your merry way\nIn this case the data the next three months is going to be critical does it show a further ... rationing housing do autos continue to roll over if the answer to those questions is yes mhm then you do have further room to go here so that's it it's going to be really interesting 'cause the trend on that data suggests the answer will be no\nLet's talk about how we got data out from the national association of realtors as it relates to pending home sales yesterday we saw new home sales numbers that were very disappointing a housing seems to be weakening despite the fact that there's a tremendous amount of demand\nYeah in in in housing I I think it is not not even seems to me it is weakening and specifically last month for the first time in a while you saw an increase in inventories any decrease in sales okay that's not a good recipe for healthy housing\nMarket no but I mean the increased inventory level is nowhere near where you'd like to see it like you'd like to we like to have somewhere I don't know\nTucker would like to see Eighteen months of inventory available because that means prices were low but six months is healthy and I think still what are we a three four months\nSo we're ... I I saw charred on this yesterday I'm trying to find where it is a year ago yeah uh oh no this is just for a new home sales started not exist things so I have no help there but here's here's what we're seeing a new home sales to put this in perspective\nEarlier this year really late last year when things were peaking ... we had about five and a half months of new home inventory that was available\nNew home not existing but I'm looking new country and you know okay today on new home inventory we're up to seven point two months and that's tough for the builder says you know so that is their building these things on spec often\nIt is in the last time that we saw numbers at that level in terms of ... the number of a month's supply of new homes not looking at existing but a new homes which again or a small part of the market but it's where you get a lot of activity\nFor jobs the last time we saw numbers like that was two thousand\nTens C. my observation is that the when I drive around and they see the new homes that are being built there these big mansions silly long ones they they're they're building ... they're buying these two acre lots and they're building these houses that are I don't know five and seven thousand square foot house was\nBuying them but there was the only ones that are profitable for them to make if you could actually itself you could actually sell them and so I I look at it and that number is a little spooky and by the way that number in terms of months of ah inventory for new home sales that number is increased each of the last six months\nOkay so we're building the wrong types of homes and there's an excess of new homes but when you look at existing homes in total real estate for sale is still under a healthy level you still have a lot of pent up demand most millennials still do not own a home\nNo and and it's because it it\nIt's and they're in their prime age like a millennial even a young millennial now it's like Twenty one twenty two years old\nI took her where's the line from millennials to that next generation that we really don't like\nThese are like Twenty years old they are taught is that what it is okay Nineteen twenty yeah so ... do a fact check uh let's see here between Ninety excuse me eighty one in Ninety six are considered millennials yes so millennials twenty to\nTwenty or thirty seven twenty to thirty seven so\nYeah you you still have even you know for younger millennials in that twenty four twenty five range you know they're still not buying at the rate that historically they have leaving the old ones aren't like a thirty dollar eighty five you're ... or ... or not they're not in in its affordability you know that that is the key driver here it's a forty\nIf if Tucker could have found a home that he liked it but he wanted he would have bought ... you know but I get the issue that doctors running into is the homes that he wants to either too expensive or other people are coming in bidding up the homes that he wants to make them too expensive\nIt's just a matter of the you you've got a market that is not in balance right now it's got to change over time\nAdam Johnson joins us now from New York you know our weekly stock picking segment you the founder and author of bull's eye brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors [noise]\nHad 'em heck of a week the heavier how's it going\nYou know about a week ago I said I think on the ... started and I want I Want to let you know I Am on my back hurt\nSo let's let and yeah I understand it it it is not been fun I I Am not bullish at the moment and and I want to talk a little bit about why that is to see if I can get a response from me and my view is that any time you get a market correction it is a test of whether or not the economy is strong enough to maintain valuations\nWe saw one back in early earlier this year the economy over the next few months answered that bell and said yep we are strong enough and the market continue to move up words\nIn this case we're seeing some pretty important data declining housing in autos and I don't think there's a chance to those turnaround in the next few months so I think we're closer to a bear market than a recovery here what are your thoughts on that\nThere's an additional component that I think we need to address and it's called valuation and actually get sick with what you're gonna get Gretchen housing auto because\nUh we just got earnings yesterday report\nAnd believe it or not a little bored at trading down to you know I'm a big dollars on a beat the earning ... ... ... it reiterated the fourth quarter\nAt thirty one says okay\n[laughter] you never want some kind of just reiterating that you are in fact going to make what they\nSaid you know what you said you were going to make it not backed up you know eight or nine ... acquainted with white valuation better\nIf you take a company like afford down for now you will find value buying it thinking just stabilize that ethic bored with trading yesterday on the low at about ... times already I mean think of that and by the way using ... percent [noise]\nWe'll hear\nIt and also one other point there when we factor in the earnings rose and this is a point you know for the bulls that that you do after that I have to acknowledge here\nIf you factor in the earnings growth that we've seen this year even with the market being equivalent to where it was at the start of the year we are way cheaper on a relative basis than we were ten months ago so there is you know some comfort thing look valuations are stretched in general but that doesn't mean they're necessarily stable here\n[laughter] yeah well I mean I think you and I are ultimately trying to find some sort of common ground even

W. R. Keanu Reeves as news bridge this morning of more suspicious packages founded dress to former vice president Joe Biden and actor Robert De Niro President Trump is blaming the media for what he calls the anger in society NBC's Peter Alexander says the president has an opportunity to set a different tone deliver a unifying message right now\nTip and there's still no great place to go on the sidelines\nThat the answer though that it doesn't matter well I don't know it doesn't matter if there's no great place to go with people don't want to be in markets leave you know\nBut it's a lot more tempting to go out and buy a ten year treasury when the yields four and a half percent than it is when it's three\nI think in the short term if you're talking next two years there's a bull case to be made an intermediate term treasuries\nIf the fed has to pivot you could get that ten year coming down to two and a half\nIn a hurry cool that would be nice [laughter] All right at least be nice for me it wouldn't be nice for a lot of other people by UPS raising their shipping prices well you know what I've been waiting for this guy that I I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner\nNot surprising here they are planning to deliver eight hundred million packages in the United states between Thanksgiving and Christmas that's about six percent from the seven hundred and fifty million they delivered last year\nThey did not do well on their brown recruiting day either by the way we do we know what kind of numbers they were able to bring in all nothing they they're not they're not saying but that's not good the all the uh people\nOr you know the reporters that we're going to the sites you said it was it was not strong they want it was the hundred or a hundred and twenty thousand they were trying to bring on that one day they're trying to do forty thousand\nJust on that one day so what they're doing here is obviously they're seeing their costs going up because of fuel because of wages and so what they are doing is they are raising\nPrices on domestic deliveries and also adding surcharges on oversized packages and so when we take a look at their us business the revenue per pieces up four point eight percent for the third quarter which is the fastest growth they've seen me in their pricing since twenty eleven so when the last seven years [noise]\nUm so you've got prices coming up here my big question on this is whether this has an impact on some of the companies that currently offer free shipping name Amazon do they have to raise their prime price again they already raised at once this year that I have to go up again at some point number two you have target saying hey we're going to a two day delivery\nOr a two day delivery free for free\nWell they might be able to do it for Christmas this year can they continue that going forward because that's going to be a real margin squeeze so I think there are some questions then for businesses that rely on both UPS and FedEx\nHey can they maintain some of the price and the people of you know become accustomed to and if they can't how much does that affect people's ability to shop online the same way that they buy in stores because one of the\nWouldn't that be something to fall of a sudden people started to go and buy into stores again because the prices were ten percent lower it could be ...\n... ... yeah he\nDid for going to store with a lower price if there's ... ... you know like you just about anything you're buying it you should get rewarded for you drove to the story you didn't ask somebody just delivered to end or in a\nTheory that would be the case the other ... you know answer for these companies could just be hey we'll just raise the price of all of our products by you know two percent and Walsh said at\nLeast for ways the different companies can hedge it I think they're going to react to a little bit differently but there's there's definitely inflation coming on the side of shipping we're seeing it one hundred\nPercent right now [laughter] Seventy two percent of employers conduct background checks on all the employees that they hire in twenty nine percent\nCheck credit reports that's an interesting side I I actually thought it would be higher than Seventy two percent checking backgrounds right you would think that that would be pretty close to a hundred percent I Would think you know you're going to have somebody come in and work and be near the cash register any job right I'm I'm doing a background check on make sure they're not an ax murder\nAbsolutely and so you know the big things that they're looking for when they do these checks you know can you be trusted with money or you who you say you are a you know those types of things they want to learn a little bit more about you we had to\nKind of hit a lot of pushback though I'll tell you if you if we asked if we did a poll\nAsking whether employers should do credit checks people get very uptight about it like credit checks I I like them that way back round Jackson I ... I like them both I I Want to know as much and I don't care whether I'm ... hiring somebody to flip burgers\nOr whether I'm hiring somebody to deposit checks I Want to do as much about them as I can and I think your credit score\nIs an indication as to what kind of character you have\nWhat if someone just doesn't take out any credit that's fine that's fine ... like if you have a conversation about it before you hire somebody I like to know when I hire somebody I like to know that they have a strong credit score because of strong credit scores means that they pay their bills on time what they pay their bills on time\nMaybe that means they'll actually show up for work on time [noise]\nYeah maybe that means that they'll actually do the job that they're asked to do for the wage that they agreed to do it for\nI've always liked background checks credit checks I feel don't tell you I I just because there's so many reasons why someone could potentially have a\nBad credit report explain it that's fine they I've had that situation come up before because we do credit checks and I've had situations where I sat down with a candidate and said jeeze your your your credit's all screwed up what's the problem well I went through a nasty divorce this happened okay well that that's fine right I just but I Want to know that and I I I think most employers\nBoy I Can't imagine why they would not want to know that yeah I I don't\nView credit at the same way as you know looking at you know just don't have you know criminal issues I have you credit differently I guess\nThat was up two hundred and thirty six points are gonna be talking about some new menu additions at McDonalds when we return to the financial exchange\nNews is going to me and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your portfolio the financial exchange with very Armstrong ... on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique products and cash management services to help you collect rent managed condo association payments and\nDigitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.
