{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "The the public schools in Manchester have a sick day issue with teachers taking sick days so in in Manchester the big city in in New Hampshire right [noise] they have a thousand and four teachers on staff\nAll those thousand and four five hundred and fifty four of them or more than fifty percent of the teachers in Manchester last year took ten or more sick days during the course of your\nHand well that seems rather high conversely Nashua which is I think the second second or third biggest city in ... national as eight hundred and forty eight\nTeachers [noise]\nPub the eight hundred and forty eight teachers zero took ten days or more off for sick time [noise]\nSo in Manchester you have over fifty percent of the teachers in Manchester schools taking at least ten six days a year and a master where you at zero percent\nThat's just kind of statistical\nOddity don't you think oh I don't know which one's wrong right or if he's not an odd kind of a group mentality type thing you know what I mean like uh oh gosh well change that did it and it was all good there all the flu can head didn't end in Manchester and not have national is our mowing\nFit they have comparable vacation another\nBenefit not in this story the story is specifically just sick days\nBut I mean like do we know if they have comparable I don't I just I mean if it's possible that national give it a lot of vacation days in Manchester does it could be [noise]\nVery interesting interesting little kid that I get the teachers probably more sick days and maybe a lot of people 'cause they're exposed to kids all the time of like you know because we all know they're like sponges\nGerms sponges that ten days in a little more alive a lot of sick days\nWas wise man that's a lotta overtime win more than fifty percent of them are offering the minimum of ten days yeah that's a lot of paying jobs felons\nAnd write your pain substitute teachers that hold\nA lot that that sounding very much like a tea\nAnd ask for a rainy day or you know any of these sort of organization that you might be onto something there but I don't know I didn't I'm just giving you the numbers you can make of it which are well\nJim what do you have today\nAre the company natural light which makes a assigned beverage called beer um has been going to packaging it in a Seventy seven packs a day or two giant cones filled with Seventy seven cans of beer they're currently only selling them in the state of Maryland is a trial run uh\nThey're doing it just celebrate their founding which was Nineteen Seventy seven and they're only available currently in College Park Maryland state of Maryland is fighting back against us because they're not comfortable with the concept that um college kids and their town\nCan now purchased Seventy seven cans of beer at thirty nine cents per can to bring back to campus and then binge drink with their friends\nThey feel like there's no reason why you need to buy Seventy seven years at one time\nThink I might be with him normal natural light term on top of\nI mean I I understand that you can buy Kagame that's how many you know but there's something about finding that Seventy seven cans of beer\nFor what it's worth a couple of them to get it back it's heavy all of the liquor stores to have to carry the Seventy seven pack ... park have sold out every time they've got to have lines out the door every time they have them ... making a magic then that's going to be a big hit with college students of course has this one\nBecause I Do obviously aid binge drinking or just college drinking period but I Do like gimmicky product [noise] how do we market are same product and you get people interested in NFL let's do a Seventy seven back because we came in Nineteen Seventy seven\nI don't mind that in the short run yeah they are they\nAnd they have a band that you say in a big news of the\nComptroller of the state who is in charge of regulating alcohol in that state said that he's concerned that they're promoting binge drinking and they're looking at I mean\nThe one thing if they offered that up like everywhere but they're ... it's such a target on his right University of Maryland yeah\nThat's the part I think I don't like if if you know if I went down to my local swam Scott place and they hadn't Seventy seven for Seventy seven years or whatever it is I'd be like okay that's good that's a little the only by that over the holidays because you were going to entertain a lot or something\nBut to have that next to the fraternity row is I I think kind of\nThrow on hold on right there I Will buy Seventy seven natural light beers and put them in your house and we'll see how many of them are gone out for the holiday well\nI'm I'm ... years ears morning when you know though you know that if I but I think in Seventy seven beers and I put them in my fridge and I wouldn't just sit around and drink to oblivion unlike when to sit next to the you know HBO house and they uh\nThey just start going to drink until there's not there's nothing left\nTo somehow I just I Can't see now do you like being a favorite and the current and\nAfter I got a story behind a Nettie light campus a thing we have\nCoolers and or T shirts or whatever because it's a\nI think you're telling you this devious he walked in to someplace at Twenty one years old and the woman said are you a college student he said yes and she said you win and suddenly they've they've you know he felt this year for nearly on him hoping he take it back to campus and you know I mean they they are\nGoing after a certain crowd for sure uh do you have something for us today marina yes the minds on the theme of education as a as well as what maybe was saying earlier but it's completely different story out of Texas I thought this was really interesting\nAs a Texas high schools now are implementing new coursework which I thought it was kinda cool actually we're a great nine through twelve they must receive instruction on how to deal with law enforcement and uh and it's a sixty minute video that they are showing I Believe during classes and so forth\nOn how to interact of course when you get stopped by the police how they're going to interact and it's just really informative I think it's a good idea especially with what's going on now in the country I think it's a really good ideas or Texas is doing that right now they're introducing it into their course work\nYeah this is going to be a requirement in taxes you have to have\nSeen the video in order to ah to graduate we we had tossed around the idea of talking about that today and maybe we can talk about some other time I I Can't I have to see that video I haven't had there was not enough time to see it the most\nFrom what I was reading it's part of a more comprehensive program that also involved was better police training and I know ... it's not just saying\nThat right like it's kids kids need to just break whatever they get and that's the way life and then the police are getting more training to force on you know interacting with the public and community and teenagers and all that\nMuch more effective in high school than any high school video I ever saw one on abstinence and the one on ... and the one with the banana aren't those didn't help in any way shape or form there was no the video and don't drink at the prom because none of those had any effect on any kids behavior so let's hope this one's more effective\nThan most or you're starting to feel a little funny\nDown there [laughter] and that is that live video ... to ...\nFirst Russian and so I said was do you build up an aunt or an odd man I'm dots were done visit irrelevant things we do I think I'd rather see the uh what do you do during a traffic stop if I'd rather watch that one too [laughter] oh my well\nWe'll see it'll be interesting to see how that does go I mean if it's if it's in conjunction with more than just showing the kids\nI might be more inclined to think that was a good idea but it needs to be a training for police as well\nWe'll leave it right there\nYou have fun today gyms I did and you show me a John Hughes dealing with bullies video anytime I Love the idea [laughter] All right we're leaving it they're going to get everybody will be heros during marijuana back tomorrow and say\nBoy so Boston you walk working about one hundred point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] show\nOur morning Moby W. R. K. O. knew\nThe Washington Post is publishing the last column written by Saudi journalist ... he disappeared and may have been murdered after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second a colleague at the post Karen attire called editing the piece one of the saddest thing she's ever done\nCame into ... last September our writing a piece about how there are precious Saudi Arabia has gotten so unbearable that he felt they need to uh to flee basically to Washington\n[noise] so I don't think they can just because the baseline growth that we're seeing projected for next year right now is a particularly strong anyways it's coming to you know we're protecting two and a half percent next year which you know it was a significant flowing from this year the reasons for that obviously terrorists are going to play a role into that\nYou have a tight labor market where look you could only grow GDP by pulling two lovers when it's all said and done\nHours worked and how productive you are during those hours if everyone's important never once employed full time who wants to be how many more hours you're going to be able to work there's only so many more people that you can actually get into the labor force so that means you've got to pull the productivity lover well we haven't seen productivity gains of any meaningful number and in the last\nDecade but what about robotics\nWould it out and like you look at robotics if all of a sudden you've got robotic cars and robotic warehouses we going to have that next year well your ear the cars are coming this year right\nAround the earth day any meaningful number we got two hundred and Ninety million ... we're two hundred and Ninety million ... of human driven cars on the road today and how many self driving ones are we going to have ten thousand twenty or you know so that there simply aren't the productivity gains to be had\nSo what is it the the ... the neutral rate they like this is the part I don't understand I read the fed minutes and Powell says and this is a quote from Jay Powell yep we're a long way from neutral at this point probably I mean talking that that\nLeads me to believe they don't really know what we're neutral like there are many they don't know we're neutral\nIs the other thing that you have to remember what the fed as much as they are a policy institution saying hey here's what we're going to do and here's what we're going to execute in the last decade really the last two decades they've become a messaging institution\nIt doesn't give you confidence so when you hear the chairman of the fed saying you know we uh we\nWe kinda think we're a long way from neutral but we don't really know for sure I mean it what what is it like we um investors want to know I thought they our rates go to four percent are they going to three percent are they going to two and a half\nWhen when I look at what Jay Powell was doing here and again you have to have this from a messaging perspective what is he trying to signal that he's trying to signal that we are not going to let inflation get out of control because once it does get out of control it's really hard to put that genie back in the bottle\nIt's a lot easier for him to be hawkish and go to dovish ...\nThan the other way around thinking about it if you start off dovish right and then you say hey by the way we got a hike rates really quickly ... what happens to the housing market what happens to the stock market okay it's a lot easier or it'd be hawkish and goaded dovish than the other way so from my perspective and I think he's saying look\nWe're going to be as aggressive as we need to be in order to tamp down on inflation\nBut I think if you get into next year I I think that you end up in a situation where the economy is not strong enough\nFor it to warrant higher rate I think the feds between two really difficult their options\nHere so you're looking at two more hikes that's it you're just looking at one in December\nMe personally I'm looking at two more hikes and then I think the fed let's inflation run hot because they're ... I don't think you can get to the point\nWhere this economy can sustain four percent interest rate so hike in December and then won some time in the first half of next year for ... and I think that's it that's it right tickets I I think they realize they have to let inflation run hot they just don't want a message it\nWell the you you may be right I you know many of you are\nBuying a lottery tickets in anticipation of winning the mega millions a we have an office pools going I Wonder how many people who haven't ... I think everybody's in it we got everyone in yeah so what do we got like twenty people it's like we get a couple of hundred bucks in there I think ... winner odds now would you know they're\nGood [laughter] versus are good [laughter] I'm going with Tucker [laughter] well let's look at\nThe uh the the the answers to questions that you might have if you were to win the mega millions a ... ... if you when it's a nine hundred million right\n[noise] that's what it is currently it might go up by tomorrow based on how many people were buying tickets originally tomorrow is going to be eight hundred and thirty six million\nBut nine hundred million is the annuity amount sets like thirty million a year for Thirty years or something like a exactly and if I Want to lump sum\nSo the lump sum is to get smaller okay if you take a look at the cash option right now it's five hundred and Thirteen million if you ... I'll take the lump sum [laughter]\nNow you you don't want I don't care I Want an amount ... stuck or to keep in mind okay the first is even with that you're not going to get that entire five hundred and Thirteen million dollars because they require you to withhold a big chunk up front so that Uncle Sam doesn't end up getting caught behind the eight ball when you spend it all on a young guy only four percent right off the top\nSo they're going to take that right off the top okay which isn't enough because the tax rates thirty five okay it's going to end up being significantly higher\nBut the other thing you want to keep in mind Tucker so you get five hundred million dollars after taxes you're going to end up with college somewhere around\nThree fifty okay oh shucks ...\nNot okay keep in mind you can't keep your name secret [noise] they had read it on line okay so everyone who's ever met you okay Jimmy and grade ... by the way I guess I'd have to change my main including including Barry ... if you'd have to change you'd have to go in to witness protection alright ...\nThere's only six states where you can keep her name secret Delaware Kansas Maryland North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina I'm so there's not a whole lot of anonymity at this point\nLet me ask you a question of Chuck in all seriousness let's say you when the nine hundred million and I know everybody takes the lump sum but that means you're subjecting\nThat lump sum to a five percent tax in the state in which you live right assuming you live in Massachusetts he lives in New Hampshire but if you're a Connecticut resident Massachusetts resident\nYou're paying five and moved to new ... New Hampshire before tomorrow way you can't that's the whole problem you've you've won that ticket so no if you take tomorrow\nI'll be by yeah well do you going to do that just pick up and go right across the board if you take the annuity option though you could move to Florida or New Hampshire\nAnd then have those taxed at a lower rate in those states overtime yet normally I Would tell I was talking to Jim Pluto this morning as you were talking about whether we're going to take the lump sum or not and should always take the lump sum please tell ya you know you're really forty percent right off the top Tucker so you know that number you gave five hundred and Thirteen movies really like so\nMuch would you get paid a year if you didn't take the lump sum it was thirty nine Thirty years or thirty million bucks a year which in the end you'd end up with how much uh you'd end up with somewhere around twenty million a year but you don't have like a little bit okay so five hundred you get twenty million a year when you get it out so down wouldn't\nHave to pay the state income tax because then you could move to a non tax state huh okay that that was the mayor went to the early on them you know if you want to move um how long do you have to clean the jackpot so let's assume Lee when and how much time do we have before we have to claim it\nDepends on the specific state but it's anywhere from a hundred and eighty days two years to the big thing that they always tell people will give if you do win the lottery ...\nIf if for whatever reason you end up winning this thing which odds are you're not going to but if you end up winning this thing before you go and claim it mhm take some time to figure out who you're going to work with to get everything in order because the second you claim this thing up\nEvery attorney every financial advisor every person out there is going to want to work with you you want to find the people who don't want to work with you now the people who say I'm not really sure like you want people who are you know okay you know get your money and about two weeks and I'm Sorry you want people who are going to want to work with you know before you have the money\nBut you're going to get paid in about two weeks what's a ... like from friday you say okay it is friday night you're going to know you as a way it's it's\nIt's a it's within a couple of weeks so before you actually go and claim this and you want to have all the legal work done that you need you want to have a brokerage accounts that you know you want to have all those things in order to have a place because otherwise everyone in their mothers out saying hey we want to work with you you want the person who already wanted to work with you before you had five hundred million dollars\nOr well our poll question today is are you buying a mega millions lottery ticket I I'm raising my hand I already put my ten bucks in uh that's my limits and we haven't done this in\nYears first thing that you're gonna buy with a ... private jet a permanent get two really good Turkey's for Thanksgiving\nStare biker [laughter] anyway um\nThat's our poker after you go to financial exchange show dot com to participate in the poll are you buying a mega millions ticket when we come back we'll be talking about another company that is offering an early retirement package this package is better than the horizon when we talked about last week we'll be back in a few your hopes\nBreaking financial news of financial exchange with Barry Armstrong and Chuck's on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company\nYou need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique\nProducts and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and digitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

L. D. law it's a law that\nBasically limits the amount of time they are allowed to spend behind the wheel\nOr you know one would think that a trucker would be happy that they wouldn't be allowed to work and drive more than eleven hours during the course of a day\nBut the problem is they spend so much of their time stopped and at a warehouse or picking something up that they are limited in terms of how much money they can be made because truckers I don't think people notice truckers often times are working by the mile not the hour\nYeah they're they're they're paid by the mileage that they do not by the hour in a lot of cases here\nAnd so because of these time limits if they're sitting there waiting or if they've got a fourteen hour block where they can only drive eleven hours you know hey if five of those hours you chewed up by a just sitting waiting for delivery guys you they have to load the truck you know they can only drive nine of those hours actually showed you know that's how it ends up working [noise]\nUm and so the the big thing is that you know they end up chewing up a lot of the time that they could spend working now are just waiting for deliveries instead\nThe problem they have now is in the old days it was a paper journal and they they just the if you got if you saw and we all thought right you'd see a state trooper pulling over a trucker and they might look at the journals are they pull into the truck stop and they and they look at the journals gift was paper and the truckers could fudge those those records\nWill to E L D those or electronic and it measures whether the motors running or not and you can't fudge\nNo and and pretty much these logging devices were mandated as of December ... twenty Seventeen so what I'm curious to see\nIn the years before if you take a look at the ... and really the reason that they're they're doing this has to try to make driving safer right now there's not just for the truckers but\nYou know if a truck hits or your car your cars that take the ball on through the day you're that you're you're done okay\nAnd so in twenty sixteen as an example forty four hundred and forty large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes what I'm curious about is whether there's a statistically significant difference now that this law is in place here if we don't know for five years no it'll probably take two or three years to be able to tell but look\nI'll tell you what if that number goes from forty four hundred down to Fifteen hundred ... pretty clear ... even though you might not have all the conclusive daddy need it might be a really strong sign that things are moving there if you go from forty four hundred and forty two hundred\nYeah you're probably a need for five years of data in order to figure out if there's something statistically significant that's actually going on here\nThe whole theory behind the law was that the truckers retired and they're having accidents because they're driving too much and they're exhausted ... right that that that's the whole genesis\nAre ultimately it should increase wages [noise] right 'cause you're you're you've got your fewer truckers that are available to work even fewer hours one would think that these guys and gals would start making more money it is still not that there's not be although they are they are ... well not that I was\nThere was the highest rate of pay increases that if any industry\nWhile I understand but it's still not where should be you don't know about half of what it was in the seventh so it\nIt it still is well below where it should be the downside to hire truckers pay is that with how much we buy online today is going to drastically affect shipping costs and that's part of the reason why you're seeing the post office looking for ten percent hikes now just about everything that they're trying to mail these\nDays on Amazon raise their prices by what twenty percent to be a prime member yup they went up\n... it's all going to filter through no paper which again these are people who should have been paid more to begin with I don't have a problem with it but that's what the reality is known to be\nFolks in terms of uh where are we going on this\nCould have that you had your life I had I had it out of order I didn't know what I Know I had it out of\nOrder here so I guess we'll do it now and folks over twenty

know weekly stock picking segment you the founder and author of bull's eye brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors Adam good to have you on today\nOh thanks for having me as always\nAdam I Want to talk a little bit on raids cheering and specifically we got a you know some submitted notes from the fed yesterday\nAnd it it seems like there's a very hawkish tone there my personal view is I don't actually think the fed is hawkish as they're presenting I think it's just easier to go from hawkish to dovish down the road than the opposite what's your take on the situation\nI think you're right and I think it's also important to look at what they're actually thing and you know kind of funny though these guys out there who read these I'm fed minutes then create all kinds of the chart based on the word\nYou know a pure and the word strong or some variation of drawing like strongly are stronger strongest whatever anyway\nUh some variation on the word strong appeared like thirty crime and all of the minutes since April as opposed to a year ago when you thought you know some version of strong lonely like you know three or four so clearly the fed is saying you know things are getting better their quote unquote getting stronger but um you know\nIt it's at this point with GDP at ... percent and inflation only you know in the two you know to point to two or three percent I'm actually a really good combination so it you know strong is not something to be worried about right now\nIn terms of oil a oils being focused this week with uh the murder of the Washington Post journalist uh who were not sure exactly what happens but it happened but it doesn't ... really good\nThere's been a lot of talk as to whether or not the U.S is going to take a a retaliatory response in response to Saudi Arabia here\nWith the oil market not really suggesting that that's going to happen with west Texas intermediate below Seventy dollars a barrel after being above Seventy five last week it merely suggesting especially when you hear the rhetoric coming out of D.C it doesn't sound like there's going to be much of a response here\nAgreed and by the way thank you for mentioning that you know because\nIf we look at the headlines and jump on Twitter and and you know we just get carried away with the emotional thing whatever happened there we don't really know what ever happened is crazy but what matters more than anything else is the relationship between\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S you know Israel and Saudi Arabia are the strongest allies the U.S has in that region and let me tell you we need them in spite of the craziness whatever the Saudis which clearly is pretty shocking world the fact that oil\nIs under the book tells you the marketed dried there's a way to the break down in the relationship because if there were\nIt'd be a lot higher than that fact is on Saudi Arabia the U.S and Russia\nAre all competing more than eleven million barrels a day we have never seen that before though there is a lot of oil out there and I'm Glad to see the reality is that by the band was governing oil right now not the emotion behind the crazy situation however with them\n[noise] and um I have a question for your relating to a growth in twenty Nineteen ... you'd chatted a ...\nA bit about you know word for point two percent of GDP right now I'm curious where you think things are going in Nineteen just 'cause\nI Will get the message out there and it does have me concerned about a slowing specifically\nLook with regards to long term GDP Growth there's two lovers you can pull how many hours do people work in the aggregate what kind of productivity they have I don't see movement happening rapidly enough next year to get us back to three percent I'm curious what your thoughts are on it\nIt's going to be hard to squeeze more productivity out of people I mean we already have unemployment at what point seven percent a year low yeah people are working hard you know our early\nA number of hours that are worth per week you know that's trapped by the deal is you know that that's pretty strong it's hard to take it too\nMuch higher than we are now so I I hear you on

lottery though no yeah they're making money do you handle fair they're going to pay out nine hundred million but how much they make\nA boatload right you know but I think in general a they pay out maybe a quarter of what they really don't know I I don't know probably depends on the game and you know whether their state lotteries versus these national ones and things like that I I don't know\nI don't know bart is buying a cancer drug maker called an does site for two point one billion dollars in cash why would they do that\nYes there are they're buying this company a for again that to point one billion dollar\nA price tag new year and you know pretty much Novartis if if you take a look at you know what they're trying to do here\nUm it's ... they're trying to buy effectively drug pipeline specifically related to oncology that's way under state really specializes in I have no idea at all this is a good price or fair price for the company but the big thing is Novartis even growing much organically at this point their sales growth was you know three percent for the quarter\nA there you know earnings growth was two percent for the quarter so they're relatively stable company right now and I think to be completely honest or going out there saying hey we want to try to buy growth for the future I thought a lot of ...\nThe right they they ... they buy these little small biotech\n... is the right now it's one of the main ways that a lot of these companies build their pipelines and grow at this point I'm just because it it gives them away so they don't have to do the early stage investing they can say OK here's where the risk is right\nMaybe it early stage there's risk even if some of these I mean we've seen cases where you know drugs get you know company a buyer you know another company that's in stage to her stage three of you know if the approval\nAnd the thing flops on its face and they got to write the whole thing off I mean there's there still is that potential out there there's definitely less risk if you're going in to this to the stage of company\nBut there still is a lot out there just because\nAgain you you never quite know what's going to actually end up paying off I mean think about all the old timers trials that have been out there in the last couple of years where you've had a couple of mark said look we're just we're giving up on it 'cause we can't do any like\nYeah they they're so much all summer is one where they there's been a lot of false starts doesn't there\nIt it it's it's like fusion power we are always ten years away from a cure that it's just you're always ten years away it feels like\nA a Tesla advancing in China buying land for a factory that they think they'll actually own\nYes they bought a two hundred and ten acres site in a ... just outside Shanghai cost them about a hundred and forty million dollars to buy this um which I Will get this is my first question to be honest was okay so they bought the land for a hundred and forty million the gig factory they built in Nevada cost them was a three billion dollars I think\nWhere they're going to get the money to build this thing well you know I Wonder if you know ... ... if the Chinese government's investing well and and this is where I was going so you almost because obviously not a fan of the SEC the short seller enrichment commission as he called them a couple of weeks ago which probably didn't do any favors\nI Wonder if he ends up getting kind of pushed into China's orbit on this and do we really want to lose a guy like that [noise]\nFor the ... depends what you mean by a guy like that\nPretty bright guy and then ... it'd be like ... you know you think about all the innovation that he's brought whether you're talking about pay Powell a space acts he space exes nip and you know test of whether you like the guy or not it's pretty smart guy either you really want to chase them into the arms of the Chinese\nAre really smart guy there's no doubt about it but I Would make the case you kind of chased themselves they're ... you know it's not like based on behavior yeah we ... it it's all his own doing that you know so I I just wonder if you start sending up walking coaster that orbit but to be honest I don't know if you'd really get along well in China I don't know that you know like I\nLike I say and he's going to be five hundred thousand cars a year there I don't know\nIf he doesn't like the oversight from the SEC yeah you think he's going to like Chinese oversight right in Chinese oversight is come over here we're going to put a bullet in your head so it's it's it's something I I just don't know if he is necessarily a good fit over it but he might find themselves kind of pushed into that orbit\nYeah well the the ... we will watch that story or with continued interest\nA question comes up what happens if you convert a rental property indoor personal resident who says you say you bought a property in Florida and you you live in New England you bought a property in Florida\nYou bought it five years ago you bought a ten years ago and you rented it out so you've been renting it out collecting the income on it and now you're retiring truck and you want to move into that ... property in\nFlorida you get a CPA yeah get ahead if yeah so\nIn the way that it typically works remember you can declare a property as a primary residence if you've lived there for two out of five years and being able to do that allows you to offset up to five hundred thousand dollars and capital gains if you're married two hundred and fifty thousand if you are single that's the exemption you get if you're able to satisfy that requirement\nIt's a little different when you have a rental property\nIn that if you've been depreciating that rental property there's going to be some recapture of that depreciation that you've taken and that\nThat's what I wanted to point out on this story when you do that you can do it you can convert a rental property into a personal residents you can get the five hundred thousand dollar tax free game but you can never escape that depreciation recapture you're always going to pay the taxes on that\nSo if you owned it for ten years and you wrote off two hundred thousand dollars of depreciation yeah\nEven if you're within that five hundred thousand kept gain tax free cap game you're still going to pay the tax on that two hundred thousand of depreciation\nThat you know it's really important to make sure that you have any attacks advised if you will get that that just because otherwise it's going to be a situation where I've seen cases where people don't realize that the case and all of a sudden the IRS is you know sending them a letter and they're going gee I thought I got this exemption and he got the exemption on the sales price but do you have to factor in that depreciation recapture\nComing up we're going to be joined by Stephen Moore and asked Steve some questions as it
