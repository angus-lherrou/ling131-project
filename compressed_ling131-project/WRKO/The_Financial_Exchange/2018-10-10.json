I forget what there I was just talking to a friend of mine that like the woman who had the peacock\nWas it like a glider some bad guy that's right that's very good very good man very good\nIdea or something I Do I Do um the B movie first man this is a little bit of controversy earlier but is it is coming out this weekend\nIt's coming out friday and on Thursday night regal theaters is doing to sneak preview of it are doing the snake shows Thursday night and they have announced in conjunction with the ah University of actors or any\nActive or a veteran service members to go on Thursday night to a regular theater to see first man in the first twenty five will get inferring\nOh that's cool nicer three locations around the greater Boston area including the fed and we want to so if you are in the military or were in the military and you were looking to see this movie or they're going to thank you for your service with a free ticket says super good for them it's very\nStrange you'd I did not talk before but I have a a veterans are related to last word as well um I've been contacted by a mass higher\nAnd earlier this week we talked a little bit about the gets disabled\nVeterans of America and how\nAre they are working to make sure the disabled veterans get hired well November is um hire a veteran months and they're going to be having a big event it's coming up on October the thirty first so Halloween it's at the Massachusetts state house to help then kick this off\nAnd they are looking for a any businesses that would be interested in hiring veterans to be a part of this sort of hiring fair\nThat they are going to be having so if you own a business or you know a business that has some interest would like to learn more about hiring veterans in our state\nI Want to invite you to go to mass higher and you can just Google it because I have and it will pop up and there you'll find more information\nAbout who you can reach out to ah to make sure that you can uh can you can learn more about it that you can actually even have a booth or a table they're\nSo again you just go to mass higher\nYeah I mean one of the things that they have been watching is the fact the capital could start flooding out of the countries that have have not seen since uh two thousand eight global financial crisis\nNow you know a lot of people who are trying to get capital out of those countries are attracted actually to the rising us interest rates so that's putting pressure on those markets the strength of the dollar is also putting pressure on them because it's on causing reduction and you know those you know countries currencies\nSo you know you're seeing you know the potential for capital fled for market corrections and for foreign exchange myth and across the board which cannot which can lead to the crisis\nThis looks an awful lot and it feels an awful lot like what we saw back in Nineteen Ninety seven where you had the Asian financial crisis that really started in Thailand um and started largely because at the time uh the the tide currency was it it gives known as the box\nAnd tied bought was effectively pegged it to the U.S dollar in order to keep it stable at the time well what happened was that the government could maintain that pig and they had floated\nA in order to you know effectively try to\nUm you know keep the currency of photo keep the country afloat\nAnd it ended up causing all kinds of problems throughout the region that ended up spilling over into the U.S as well um for a short time period there\nWhat worries me about this in this emerging markets situations were far more tied into these markets than we were Twenty years ago it could have a bigger effect on the U.S and the effect is pretty significant even back in Ninety seven\nAnd not to mention that foreign exchange on you know currency fluctuations aside their vulnerabilities in the government get to stress area you know you have\nI'm over forty five percent of the low income countries at a higher risk and that to staff or already experiencing it according to the IMF when his compared it only twenty five percent five years ago and in fact\nWe've already had a couple of these countries you know seek bailouts from the IMF and two of 'em yeah Pakistan you know aspirin IMF bail out you know earlier this year I Ching teenagers now the thing that so that's high levels and that are really concerning and like you said have a clear impact because we are such an intertwined globally client economy today\nAnd and this is clearly when you when if you point to what is causing this is the strength of the dollar over the course this year as you mentioned\nA you know investors flocking back to the dollar with higher rates and you have the dollar up about eight percent for the course of the year and that makes it very difficult if you are in these other countries to keep capital in your local currency just because investors will say\nGee why do I want to hold the Argentinean pay so if it's losing forty percent against the dollar I could make fifty percent but still when we get ten percent of my money it doesn't make sense for me to hold back currency and that's why you see money flocking out of those countries here\nAlong with this or a statement that was made yesterday by Dallas Fred president Robert Kaplan so that he wanted the fed to hike rage three more times one in December and then two more at sometime next year and then pause at that point to see if any additional increases are necessary\nDefinitely there watching you know productivity as one of the indicators they're watching inflation they're watching whether or not resigning season bubbles and some of the asset and that people trade and\nOn you know and they're trying to figure out what you know it's their right what they called the neutral rate which is a a level of um rate that neither ... nor slows growth and that's that's kind of tricky I mean some some you know economic forecast put that in a meeting asked me about three percent\nOn you know some say it's lower so it's going to be interesting to see what they decide\nLooking at what today's data has done I was going earlier and I was checking out what we call the fed funds futures which uh predictions for where the Fed's going to raise rates are going forward into the next year generally the predictions on this they go out about twelve months so we can see to really next October at this point we can't see beyond that to the end of the year\nBut the median projection if you're looking at it there's a thirty six percent chance now that there are three hikes in interest rates prior to next October largely unchanged from a day ago but that's up from just the twenty five percent chance a month ago and that's why you have seen interest rates rise a little bit\nOver this time period is people are saying hey look I don't want to get caught behind the eight ball and you'll be holding long term debt we need to sell this off because we're thinking rates are going to be moving up a little bit quicker than expected\nBy the way Tucker and and I believe you have this on the board at this point I Am on team we're going to have less hikes than expected because I don't think the fed is going to be able to hike yeah I think your production you're official production is one hike and twenty ninth team ready to slide that's where I'm at I'm hiking Nineteen so\nWe'll see what happens or I Will take a victory lap because it looks like I was going to be right this year ... pat myself on that for that one out but it's always a New Years so we'll see if we get into\nA as we had the next year some sad news for an American or a great American company fears\nHiring advisors to prepare for bankruptcy filing\nYeah I mean definitely sad because it's such an iconic brand and such a part of Americana and a lot of ways but it's not surprising at all I mean given the rising online retailing where they hadn't been able to keep up\nAnd also just you know lack of investment in their stores on you know fears and malls no longer really need those anchor stories as much anymore because the mall traffic is down overall um so uh so unfortunately you know Sears is feeling the impact of all of this trans\nThere's also does give me the opportunity to talk about my favorite items from the Sears catalogs that used to be around and and there's all kinds of websites that have these by the way but some of the things that they offered a back in the day this one is from\nIt looks like night teen over to this is the falls and I you know two and they had to Heidelberg electric belt\nWhich sent electric current through kind of your your your growing effectively to cure quote a week or deranged nervous system this is a real thing that's always reliable they sold it for Eighteen dollars back then other things that we have from Nineteen oh actually I'm Sorry the phone Nineteen hundred catalog\nGot into fashion with ladies plus capes really so you could have a Cape\nAnd he's looked like they were going for eight dollars and thirty five cents they were very nice I Believe there for\n'em they must have been considered really high end at the time huh I Would imagine you know everyone was walking around and capes then but the best thing that we had a we're still in this one from fall Nineteen thirty two\nUh the whole kits where you could literally order all the materials for a house or they deliver it right to where you wanted to build it and you'd be able to build your house or wherever you wanted\nA this is a home kit that was a Fifteen hundred and twenty nine dollars for the entire kittens to be able to build your house it looks like he was about twelve hundred square feet so bad at a dollar per square foot\nUm and it's it's still is one of I think the most amazing things that you know there was a company that would literally deliver you the materials to build an entire house and now they're going out of business because they lost out to companies that want to deliver to your house\nExactly exactly well and so unfortunate too because I mean they did you know carry on that strong tradition of supplying the home in the Kenmore brand is such a wonderful brand new appliances and everything and it's a real shame\nTake a break here when we come back we're going to talk about

purpose uh well I don't have some ... it it did happen in Germany actually it was German pilot so uh I don't know if it was in Germany but a German pilot who had been suffering from depression blocked the other pilot out of the cabinet and crashed into the side of a mountain so\nIt was really sad situation about maybe a year or so ago\nI'm from five oh wait no think hacking imagine if a on the Apollo moon landing a Armstrong a takeover due to a computer ... well\nHere's the thing when we talk about hacking you're assuming that that computers networked and connected to other computers if it's not ... not really a problem you like you can't hack a super Nintendo you can't hack into tar\nSee 'cause it's not connected to the Internet or needs to be connected to air traffic control somehow why does the computer I have to be because they need to go ahead to land but what you're missing you're you're missing the the critical point here why does that stack why does that section of the operating system have to be connected to what actually flies the plane\nOr you need somebody whoever's in air traffic control the land the plane to go ahead so that there needs to be some sort of line of communication between the tower and the plane\nBut why does that system have to be connected to the one that actually flies that is what is what I'm getting at\nI just literally told you [laughter]\nYou know Arthur ... no\nNo no no you're saying that air traffic control has to be able to talk to one system on the plane without saying is why does that other system after being networked in and it doesn't have to be\nBig about it this way Tucker when you go and if you've got what we do have an iPhone six iPhone success does that have the uh the fingerprint on it yep when you press the fingerprint ... do you know where that fingerprint goes\nNo take a guess\nOn the phone exactly it stays on the phone the entire time right it doesn't actually send it back to anywhere\nOn it it's not actually talking to apple ... how would the Plano when\nTo land think about it this way when you made it out of so many planes when when you make an apple pay purchased a you use your phone in a fingerprint scanner write write your fingerprint is never sent to the truth to where the transactions process no I yeah I understand what you're saying and\nI think that that's a different analogy isn't it because I think what talk are saying is that like there has to be a connection between the receiver of the twenty first stand in the sky and and and then I I agree with that analogy since on the plane I\nI agree with that but what it doesn't have to do is it doesn't have to be interface with what actually steers the plane\nI don't think you get what I'm saying I I I Do [laughter] because there's going to be planes that are delayed or so that running judge will end up by a plane landing at him is that what is the\nConcern when when you talk about hacking the plane what what what is that if the concern is that somebody else is going to take control the plane right in what I'm saying is you separate the control right from what actually what tells the plane where to go in that\nWay I'm not even now I have I'm not even talking about hacking I'm Talking about everyday use of the plane and landing but what I'm telling you you can separate either said oh ahead they need to go ahead for America trying\nTo do what they need to go ahead but the ... when when I give apple to go ahead right why actually send them my fingerprint no\nExactly that's what I'm saying ... so you can separate those systems I don't think it's a gruesome allergy hit on the exact same thing\nYeah I don't think it is [laughter]\nYou're not going to stray me on that one I needed to be some sort of line of communication between ... ... I Know that he will sky but [laughter] but it does not have\nAbout pilots just I'm again I'm I'm a wolf airplane so I get kind of caught up on these things up fuel costs typically this is according to the uh airlines for America website who knows a few expenses make up about Twenty one percent of all expenses that you pay four and a flight\nFederal government taxes makeup twenty percent\nLabor makes up Seventeen percent now labor keep in mind is not just the pilot it's also your gate agents your flight attendants\nUh your maintenance crews and so forth luggage and then non labor in non fuel expense is making forty one percent but those are you know a whole bunch of different areas but waiver overall mix up Seventeen percent my guess is the pilots are probably\nBetween twenty thirty percent of that show if you had no pilot it might be five percent cheaper but I don't think you get much below that will be my guess [laughter]\nUm no back to this Amazon store sorry for the railing 'cause I like points up when we talked about this Amazon and and travel or store here I Do think it's interesting\nUh the travelers is is moving in this direction here just because\nYou know the extent that for travelers is look if more people have security devices and rain monitors and so forth it becomes cheaper for them to ensure against losses what I'm curious about is your travelers isn't selling their own products it's you know different brands I'm curious how travelers ends up making money off of this when it's all said and done\nWell it's more about establishing I think a presence on Amazon for Amazon itself moves into insurance\nThey think they will yeah I mean I think Amazon is slowly finding different markets that it can take over and the fact is is that there is rising interest in buying insurance and filing insurance claims on line to travelers is leveraging a platform that exists and is is saying okay we're going to meet you where you are\nDo you work with a dedicated insurance agent or do you just go on to you know whatever website you go onto and buy it online which how how do you typically\nDo right now I work with an agent but I did on both because I Do my research on line so I can see where more and more people will be find this on line up slowly\nInteresting some of the time we have on this hour of the show but we'll be back in just a bit with

like a comparable here just something that's like me to a huge difference over the last like ten years that yeah it's a little scary to think about but it actually works way better um if anyone has new ideas you can test in but\nI just I find it amazing that we're so distrustful of robots and yet we just trust humans we say oh yeah humans can handle it when\nIt's been proven time and time again that we can't do a lot of cases it's it's not that I don't trust pilots it's just that robots are really really good at what they do uh-huh\nAnd I said I'm just a big believer and always having a backup plan to do with the humans have a backup plan with the robots that the red that had a backup plan and the humans I just think let's combine the two you know teamwork is always the better option\nHere's another problem with continuing to have a pilot's operating in smaller and smaller roles is robots do more is there's actually been a number of ...\nBut he's done a with regards to pilots the pilots that are trained today and they grow up on today's systems don't actually pick up the skills they need to be able to react in a crisis because they're not piling the plane enough to be able to know what to do so pretty much they're still rely on the autopilot on their instruments and so forth\nThat when something goes wrong they don't know what to do the same way that the pilot ... who who had been trained Thirty years ago knows what to do because they grew up in an era when they were much more hands on with the plane so I didn't even make the argument that because of the

fund is just not had a great couple of years here is taking a stake in Starbucks rather reviewing a stake in Starbucks\nYeah he's been historically known as an activist investor although I'm not really sure he's positioned himself as that and Starbucks but it's interesting the Starbucks Starbucks has been facing a number of challenges main one of them it's just the fact that people don't want to sugary drinks their ... aren't quite as far as they used to be\nBut they've also had to kind of slow growth and a lot of ways on they announced closures to that a hundred and fifty stories coming up and physically or twenty Nineteen which is three times the average number of closures that they've had previously\nUm they're looking at the urban markets to open up but they're slowing growth for their license stories as well like this are you seeing supermarkets and you're like that\nSo definitely a lot of challenges there it's going to be interesting to see whether or not he kinda activates and that decides to push for other changes\nStarbucks is one of those companies each time their former CEO Howard Schultz has left you know he's left twice now and each time the company has struggled to find direction and I I I really you know if if it happens once you say well maybe it was just a fluke or something\nI Will get that and I I just wonder if it's one of those rare companies that need that specific person there in order to make it successful\nThere is a person who's that transformational but also he's he still willing to try new things right right I mean everything from like the new products you see that he sells you know adding and things like music and stuff like that\nUm you definitely see you know how this creativity plays into the stores and he comes back and\nThere's definitely there definitely is creativity in a a I guess new idea I'm open mindedness in terms of Starbucks but the one thing that they really gave up on soon and throw in the white flag on our white towel and on was the wine to remember\nThat it only lasts for maybe like six months to a year they were\nTrying wine at some of the stores and it barely lasted a year and it's just like I feel like that could have been a really nice niche therefore Starbucks you know ... you know right around you know seven o'clock there is still technically open Beijing go for coffee and dessert or you have a glass of wine and wine tasting or something like that I don't know\nYou don't want I Wonder about on that is if maybe I I I almost think that it could have been successful but they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah you know is its own they I don't know what you call like you're not going to call wind box but whatever you want to call ... lumping that actually sounds smart but just\nYou know Starbucks is a place where people sit down you know they might spend the afternoon working on their novel or on a business plan or something and then a couple of people come in to see them\nBut it might not be the right atmosphere for hey I Want to stop in for you know a couple of hours in the afternoon just for a glass of wine to catch up with someone I almost wonder if they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah it's a small place it's not a bar it's you know still more of that cafe fielder but just a different\nBrand yeah the environment just doesn't to me lend itself to kind of a wine bar when you think ... those kind of like modern sleep you know not really that the cafes wonder about licensing because you know in the town you're you know put up some areas that's tough yeah and you really have to go like town by town\nTo download there should be like a wine bar or you know the Marshall Starbucks or something like that but it's something in downtown Boston or something like you know somewhere near Boston yeah I think I could see that happening a\nWeekly mortgage applications down one point seven percent we know of interest rates above a rather mortgage rates above five percent on thirty are fixed mortgages which just psychologically\nFeels like a huge difference I mean don't get me wrong it is a big difference from where we were a year and
