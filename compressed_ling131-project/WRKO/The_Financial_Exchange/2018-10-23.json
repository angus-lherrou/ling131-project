{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "The Centers for Disease Control as a parent ... it's just hard to believe but they put out a statement\nAsking pet owners to refrain from dressing up any pet chickens they might have\nNew to a particular strain of salmonella that's out there [noise]\nI guess two part question one is is there is there a chicken\nCostume market to do people actually dress up their pet chickens do people have pet chickens let's start\nThere I Know yeah my neighbor as ... she's a few doors down she has chickens and those but they have 'em in the house they usually will hold them yeah she is not dressing them up though no way oh well clearly there's a line there I mean around the house\nWith them and have a watch it\nOut on nothing I'm not saying that to defend or I'm just saying that I Know or and I know she's not dressing them up I don't look whether you want him in\nYour will eat them at some point he does not her husband would would eat chicken I Believe\nShe only keep them in the house now or sometimes bring them inside like does she have a coup\nFor their when they're free to rain go they're outside there is a coup that will keep them on the property but they're there to do those\nI realized that none of this has anything to do with the fact that she did dressing up but what does she do with those is is it an egg or the egg up and then you can\nSay I am a some sort of bugs that they don't have on whatever I'm trying to figure out why you have those chickens because I'm hoping that you don't\nHold them one day and ate that and the next what's wrong with that that's all we did start this country fry out and do you hold your food you want to hire a day and it acts like you would never made it in ... no I wouldn't even a hundred years ago I mean that's\nWhy he go get lunch and you're like I'm not I'm not taking that out that chicken I'm not doing it not doing it right\nI'm surprised you don't have chicken there may be\nIn a while but you know just having them in your backyard the kids would really like it\nOh no no no no no I'm guessing who in on this ... year old chicken ... oh yeah I'm strongly in the south\nSo that leads to the as the second question which is when you have your chin yeah lightning will you be putting ads on them or would you be dressing them up following\nI probably would we all know that I probably when I don't remember it it's not good for their how what is the number one chicken\nCostume [noise] ah ... do they have is it I don't know any Oakland\nHuh\nThe chicken that they show is dressed in like a like a cabaret F\nWipe out the one was it was more like that yeah I guess I was thinking about a female Toy Story or something but [noise]\nOh man oh man oh man\nI just you're lucky if you in case you're wondering what the CDC CDC does and whether they have your interests at heart look don't dress up your pet chickens this Halloween thanks found bang for your end my pet snake I guess I'm okay with again I'm Free to dress\nThem up ... any way you'd like but put a bowl on your boat you\nWant a definitive number like we always hear with transgender we know what to point seven percent of the population what percentage of the population dresses up their pet chickens following [laughter] I'd go back I mean are we alone hundreds and it was a little I'm elation has had chicken okay\nWhat why am I made that statement on the radio we got a call from Bob crap thing don't knock until you try it so I'm not knocking the chicken loving population right now\nI'm On record I don't get it\nYeah I like there are more than you think they have in in order to have chickens names it cannot be I don't there can't\nBe a thousand people in the ... and has now Austin was on their chicken dinner and that means I don't have a relationship with it\nI have a friend that lives probably I Would say Fifteen minutes or less from here who has a coup full of chickens I don't think he named them but you know he's married he has a daughter and are they like the fresh\nBetty as I bet they're named am I the only one that is expected that statement just to go in a different direction that was going to be I have a friend he is a chicken\n[laughter] I'd write him off\nUh yeah I don't stay posted\nA that's fascinating subject\nVery strange uh Jim how about you man\nOh so Sarah ... went on with Howard Stern yesterday this is\nHow how do you give them this interview Sarah what are you thinking what is she thinking on his lawyers will ruin goes on with Howard Stern yesterday and says that she Louis ... used to ask her cannot masturbate in front of you all the time and she was like yeah cup or that's awesome\nAnd at one point she said yeah I Want to see that yeah\nAs you said some time sheets they asked him some some time she'd say no but they used to get it together regularly and she doesn't see that as a big deal [noise]\nThat they make it together part look whatever but I don't get how and I don't get how you I always used Sarah Silverman is where she said can you have good people and yeah it's right at things and how to wrestle with that all credibility\nHas gone with that statement from her based on this for me so I Can't take their on to say this was back when we were both nobody's and it was just we were two buddies joking around and once he got into a position of power he needed a learned he had to stop that and he didn't that it was just there was one of ... that\nSupposedly\nBut just in general is I I don't at this point in the game is there any reason to be all I Know just make them put a costume on the chicken really\nUnfortunately I think that people get on Howard Stern sometimes and they just say stuff too I mean you know\nHe was in soccer is just a couple of years ago he was he said he just keeps coming out trying to you know get a following going again I don't know for you to do you have anything today\nThe mind about the states who voted or the data that was collected about what each state favorite horror movie is or the scariest movie in ... according to each state\nI saw this yet but a Massachusetts according to data the scariest movie for us here in math isn't this islands of the lambs to that in us or New Hampshire invasion of the body Snatchers don't know what that is I'm not a higher person but I guess the bee or\nWhat the lord I when I got remarried guys talking about ...\nWould you like to know any other sure go ahead tell us the rest of the New England states All right let's see um main I Believe is the host\nNow that I don't know I don't know that\nMovie ... it's kind of like a Godzilla creature of evidence yeah I don't know if that's a big critical one but very over\nTime and in Vermont and the extra test\nThat's and I mean if you're talking scary The Exorcist or invasion of the body Snatchers I mean come on in Beijing bodies are just more like a five five and ... are\nNot really like a scary\nAnd none of this this I find interesting Texas of course is the Texas chance on them and learn their scariest wind up their heads close to home\nAnd you just see the ... I actually have seen that movie I bet you were revolted by it was very disturbing\nYeah it was very disturbing\nBut yeah you're going to the fullest W ... all the states and what are\nTheir ski areas so I don't buy I saw this though like California California do you have it right in front of the orphanage\nDon't know what that is [noise]\nIt is easy and then what was um I I'm not I'm not one grand\nOregon's or Washington's right above it there was to get one of them like twilight or something like really\nWeird enough Washington is showing of the dead like Sean of the dead\nWhat's your comment is it's a comedy\nAnd Oregon was a girl walks home alone at night\nI don't know what that I'm not a hard ... title\nMhm [noise]\nAnd what's Rhode Island's 'cause I didn't I never heard of that island yeah Rhode Island is the love which\nI Do you know the love which you know I don't look that up I never heard of that more\nThan ... one of my favorite ... one of my favorites\nAre always I Wish it with our states but they didn't we didn't name it was a when a stranger calls I still love that movie in ... ... you know not not writing babysitting mhm near the end they reveal\nCalls coming from the house the girl walks home alone at night is an Iranian and moving [noise]\nAnd I see that some of these that's probably why we do know there are thousands fourteen Iranian horror film\nSo love which twenty sixteen she uses fails to make them fall in love with her\nIt's hard for me to believe that would be Rhode Island's most scary movie\nThey almost sarcastic or just their favorite Halloween type of movie you're right\nAll right we'll leave it right there have everybody will be back tomorrow say in the\nThey're bunch of damn thieves you know you look if you look down the case study I'll give you an example they they you'll get a judgment against the Chinese company for intellectual property theft and you know what they'll do they'll sue you in China with the crooked court system and get the same judgment young China going their way\nAnd that you know you've got apple stores in China that are not apple stores I mean they they it that the list goes on the amount of fraud and the amount of thievery that goes on the Chinese\nIt's just unbelievable it it may be something where we have to say we may have to go into a recession in order to spank them that I think that maybe what the market as anticipated I totally agree\nAnd by the way when I said this is more barest than I thought I'm not saying this is what I think we should not do\nI'm saying from a market perspective from a market that gets forty to forty five percent of its earnings non U. S. you know the idea of us become a little more insular the idea of us having a spat with the ...\n... okay this country like them or not and China represents forty percent of all of the world's gross\nIt represents the growth story for great American companies like caterpillar like General Motors\nI could go on and on this ... very well justified but if this is the new reality and it's a lot of men who said whoever wins the war for a high winds the world now that is the world we're in and we had Pete in a bar or calling the shots\nOr it may be the right thing and you're right but what are the consequences of investor I'd say it's more bears\nNow that it was eight weeks on the fundamental of what's going on in the world so just from the stock\n... let's talk from an investor perspective you've got the Dow down four hundred and twenty seven points windows ... when does it become a buying opportunity I think now because here's here's the reality in a truck and I were talking about this excuse me I have to leave I'm going to go buy some stocks [laughter]\nI'll tell you why because I ... you know words sixteen point nine times forward earnings trucks is nowhere like Fort Fifteen I said no I checked a month ago we were at sixteen point nine now we're at Fifteen\nThat's assuming you get the correct but we're getting the the ease rioted even above ... ... so that number Israel that number is substantial and it Fifteen times earnings that's the average price earnings ratio which means\nWe could have a major backup an interest rates and still justify these stock price yeah but the ... you could have a price to earnings ratio go to eleven what was it back in two thousand eight and nine but we have growing earnings even by what we've talked about which is barest of their earnings will go eight or nine percent\nThat's environment that will be very supportive of a Fifteen multiple on stocks and ... and it would allow us to go to four and a half percent among bond that's just my substantive fundamental\nRight you're on your and you are\nYou're you're not a technical trader who you are a fundamental and you're not worry you so you would by today and not worry about it because you're holding the stocks for five years ten years absolutely what if you're the guy though\nThat's got to pay a tuition bill next August ... what if there's a couple that has to uh\nThat that there has to ah you know pay a for a wedding ... you know the ... the I guess that what you're saying is that money your your long term you're fine in the short term you a little nervous\nMy issue is I don't I never know the short term my theory is whatever you have today that's created a little bit of wealth that's thanks to what you did five years ago as thanks for ten years ago what you do today influences your life five years ten years from now if you got tuition bills coming up next year\nI was any forecast is going to say you should be in stocks like ever because look\nBad markets can get worse right in the short term the market as voting machine in the long term it's weighing machine mhm\nI not the lecture here but I I just feel like for a longer term money this actually is a rational entry points good and it's not a good time to sell if you have more money that's just my ... year selling today I'll tell you one thing of doing it in terms of in terms of acid allocation\nIf this turns into a panic\nThat forces money into bonds against it might be a dumb move to do to commit heavily at the bar right right but if it causes your bond that you'd like to get out of to go up in price right and\nYou might be able to pair off some of that and by some cheap stocks or leaving and the money market where are the same up without take\nAny risk you heard it here first of all this is my opinion by John ... doing a lot to bring down my blood pressure is very appreciate you know we should do is let's take a look at the yield on the ten year treasury that the ten year treasury three Thirteen see none of the gun there you\nGo now if that gets down around three and the VIX is only twenty three which is yeah your blood pressure is like around one forty seven right\nNow I I look I'm not ... but as far as I remember the VIX remember back in the in\nIn in twenty seven twenty twenty ... twenty seven and a twenty or eat them in February\n... yeah I Know you've got your thirty that it's like panic times already is all a\nJump off a bridge well we'll see that any time will tell and you know John raises some good points if you need the money in the short term to pay tuition do our wedding you shouldn't be invested in stocks it's just it's just too volatile no you're you're you're you're wrecking a very valid argument\nBut like I said I mean we always tell people stand stay put ... I mean the time to buy insurance for your house is not when you see flames and\nThe second [laughter] you know [laughter]\nI got to cut you off there are no more of I Know he's got a million\nOf those things you can share with us or if you're worried about the market now and I get the sense that many of you are based on emails and text messages we'd been receiving feel free to text us our techs number is six three five six six yes the Dow is down five hundred points\nBut you know if you love the market five percent of go you've got to really love it now it's five percent cheaper six three five six six is our techs number you might put my first name at the beginning protects that would be buried B.

I have no idea I I I I can tell you I don't know who play first base but [laughter]\nI ... I don't know the catcher in a guy you know I I Will say this that if the red Sox would win this and five\nThis would be a season that is the standard against which all past and future Red Sox teams are judged\nIf you win a hundred and ... and the regular season right you beat a hundred wind team in for that was a record right a hundred and eight hours before the red Sox show not not a an ... an hour okay but they they beat a hundred when team in the first round they beat a hundred and three when team defending world champion a second round\nThis is something that we've not ever seen here than the rating should be through the roof too by the way yeah Boston in LA magic defended ... baseball magic didn't know I Know yeah it would've been invented and nobody got their wash unemployment\nLooks like two thousand again that's the New York times headline but wage growth does not and if you watched any of the ah listen to the Warren jak deal debate she brings up repeatedly\nYou know this again is is a glass half full or glass half empty story or the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been you know when you look at the rate it's as good as ever been it's fallen steadily over the last nine years is down to three point seven percent\nBut the other issue is wage growth hasn't been that great you know Barry we've talked about this ad ... interesting analysis and and this I think resonates\nThe problem is for younger people someone like my son took himself out of the workforce because the outlook is so good he's doing it to advance his education money for\nSchool so we talk we look at twenty five and twenty eight year olds a lotta times with that on employment rate goes up it's because they're confident enough to go back to school\nThe older unemployment rate say fifty five plus when that gets worse it's because a lot of people are comfortable and rich enough to retire now the ... the the demographic to watch in this raises some red

Thomas from seeking alpha has the story on the stock Rajiv thanks for joining us\nHey John Glenn Beck Rochelle\nHey raunchy this company a lion do based so an industry so I'm not familiar with it it's a Houston company you know that looks pretty cheap tell us why you like it\nA yet on the company is lined up or it's not a very well known company because it does not make him a product\nBut it makes products that go into making that things get by on the ticket and white and it's one of the plastic chemicals because of the what\nHow vulnerable used the stock price do two movements and commodity prices a lot of concern about uh the volatile commodity prices\nAre yes that that ... um so it's exposed to cart prices on ... ... ... ... ... ... on primarily at the end of the natural gas and and but the hydrocarbon in that I think\nOn and intermediate products are exposed to try and but the company has a ... job in the past uh generating operating lived in in the country\nYou know in this environment where you're talking about earlier that the one thing that we we always bring up with any stock is just how vulnerable is this to say deteriorating relations with China or increased terrorists is just the kind of company that will be hurt by that helped by that or or little impact\nI'm yeah I'm a global recession that caused by increase Tatar an increase trade what effect it decreed that demand for products\nSo you know we operate in a global world companies like the ban on the free throw a good uh coming and going across the border and um you know that that ...\nI Would say that ... price then now with this talking just eight times\nYeah I just say an eight times earnings uh thirty six billion dollar market cap a with forty billion dollars in revenue I I Wonder if this could be a possible takeover Kennedy ...\nUm yeah you know at a little ... it'd be a ... to ... take over you know would it take a look remember looking at\nSomething like ... billion takeover that definitely a company that can do it you know particularly in chemical thing you know like the F ... could look to climate\nI particularly if they want more of an American\nAnd in terms of the macro a and I kind of alluded to this earlier I Wonder if the recent weakness in the stock maybe flagging possible weakness that people are sniffing out in the global economy or just the economy at large how you think that's a big factor in the reason why the stock has been weak um\nThat that definitely you know we're looking at um economies around the world that have been a little uh you know China and Europe the U.S economy going very well you know the feeling that that can pigeon from around the world but at the U.S\nIt out and get happen but you know for all of these trade tensions will get results and uh you know we can be back though by watching them go up all the\nTime and again just to focus in on ... so what's your outlook for two thousand Nineteen assuming the the world doesn't come to an end or there aren't unforeseen problems that are are not on the radar screen right now\nUm I like to be in a pretty steady and I ... a share of\nThe company that you know has a diverse range of products uh so uh I I think that the companies should do rather than me well you know nothing but uh I don't see a big decline\nNot all a downside there does that kind of a ... yard Roger Thomas from seeking help of thank you very much for joining a symbol L.
