{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "[laughter] [noise] I'm only laughing because I think I could have almost gassed all those are all the answers to imagine to\nWarren has a press conference at three today I'd like to start by apologizing for others fake Indians stuff that was the needs me and I should have never yeah that that's an while I'm here I'd like to apologize to Brett Kavanaugh for how difficult he had it last week as long ago when I was here or joined\nOn the apology door what else Mr President should ship [laughter]\nLet's see if I may be whatever the that was a big mistake too and I want to apologize\nTo the president for ever saying anything negative about him or it ministry ... she hasn't\nClimbed back yeah I'm surprised I thought she would already ... we'll see I think she will\nI'm telling you are right at\nThat time the last word\nCarlin library tomorrow in ... I'll be there at seven o'clock in the PM so if you're in our neighborhood where we are right now but if you're in this area tomorrow and you want to have a good time by the way the uh people from Penn era that were there last time you know you better be there [noise]\nThere were great they brought a lot of stuff and it was tasty to soften count on him but ah yeah parlor in library tomorrow at seven my last word is did you see that they did it\nDid\nThey've changed the bagel um oh gee\nOh I didn't see that now they changed it because we just do this now we don't want to offend anybody in New Yorkers were offended by all week that bagel more so\nThan what they knew they plump it up they put some cream cheese on it is that what you know I mean look at yourself but they they pumped it a little bit it's still got clean but they pump that and it's clearly a cream cheese read in the middle\nWas not on the original [noise]\nSo I don't know what's the bagel with cream cheese and Moji would be versus just ... but I don't even think you can get just a bagel um oh gee now but they changed because New Yorkers complain [noise]\nGoodness craves it ever good ID I did a cow town of complaining or your grass\nIs it has a horrific I might just complaining people period [noise]\nI don't know if this is my new\nYork showing but I Am so much better with the after vehicle\nYou liked about you like it I think that is much more flour representation and I mean maybe maybe shame on ah ah apple for not doing it in the first plane ride it does look better by\nAnd I'm In Waverly out but it's not a right to fix it yeah so all of that but there's no reason you can't change it um oh gee who cares\nHowever don't do it for crime York style man no absolutely not that's when you draw dig in\nIn the first thing did look like I'm reading\nIt did it was obvious what it was\nAbout I guess we can make it something better why not but I just it feels to them till rank\nFeels like we had to make a really big deal of it [noise]\nKnow gosh I'm just watching that video of president yesterday with the uh the ... and I'm laughing out loud\nReturns millennia takes his left arm and his umbrella is in his right hand and he doesn't move but overall I don't toward\nThat they're going to the the um Dallas helicopter and we were so caught up and looking at at the time what kind of shoes she was wearing\nNever paid any attention to the fact that she's walking into writing under the umbrella suddenly dawned on him [laughter] that's right ear walking with me that is very very funny you have to laugh at that he would laugh at that and you can add rainy\nBody else though you know your first thought as they come here on it and you know I just went over to my wife even look I'm Better than the president's but you\nKnow it doesn't even enter into his head\nCash a gym what have you got going uh just to on behalf of those left the scene left not that crazy left um could we do away with the covenant which is there\nWinning the heck ceremony for Brett Kavanaugh over the weekend ... well I don't know about\nThis you know like which is to either the carbon thing\nBut there is a covenant which is you have an occult bookstore in Brooklyn New York and they are charging ten dollars ahead for anyone that wants to come in and take part in putting a hacks on Brett\nKavanaugh and all of their sexual abusers like [noise] and they're going to donate to ten dollars to various charities including Planned Parenthood which is how this whole thing got\nMore but there's I guess I'm Tucker Carlson picked up on this and is now using it to tell people that Planned Parenthood engages in satanic you know baby rituals or something so with all go back to our corners and admit that this was just a ridiculous story and\nYes ... always make good TV [noise]\nSo normally but I don't want to discourage these women from ever doing this again but do it for the ride reasons like do it's against New Yorkers that would be fine so when you put a hack\nSong someone [laughter] ... bad ... bad things happen or are they specifically putting one on them for everyone\nIn her room will focus on an image of the judge will passages restarted and candles burned a graveyard dirt coughing nails in effigy is will also be featured [noise]\n\nBrett Kavanaugh has got to be like I can probably do that because what I just went through right\n[laughter] yeah [noise]\nI I I don't know\nRight and you got a lot of other notes a mind is completely different and I'm so Charlotte pen Mike Pence's daughter and it really started second book it's titled\nWhere you go ... life lessons from my father came out today though it is the second look after her first one was a children's book if you remember the Marlon Brando or bundle excuse me Marlon bond does day in the life of the vice president\nSo her book has been released today and it's out there and she's making the the media rounds promoting it [noise]\nHow old is she\nYou know I don't quite know exactly how old she is I Believe she's in her twenties but I don't know exactly how old she is a good question [noise]\nThis particular book is of course about um the story of my pants as a father and a husband and how we serve the country and and all that but it's told from of course the daughters perspective in\nIn\nHead it's very sweet and like it\nUm my um ... on that one interest level not a lot I might get a door to door says what Doris Kearns Goodwin yeah seven hundred and eighty two out of the earth of our body as\nThey're usually about that long no mine is ... ... if I don't know if anybody's seen this enlightening maybe would might want to put this up you want to talk about this is a really really bad day I found this on the daily mail I saw this or this morning\nAs happened in China it's feeding time at the shark tank did you did you see this\nAnd this woman is running along and she slips and she falls into the shark tank while they're feeding the sharp\n... no I didn't see that and the fall is like down really deep so you can't just like fall and trip and then pull yourself back up real quick she's in the shark tank with a shark and it's not yeah I'm scared for do I want to know what happens if they got her out of thank God but\nNot without I Would have had a massive heart attack I Would have to [noise]\nShe it's Adam there was a weird thing is that the ANC is like at a mall like you know if it was out here that need it mall\nYou fall and she's she's like a clerk she not feeding them she just looking in goofing around or whatever\nAnd she walks right off and trips and falls into the tank while they're doing it and there's not more guarded like there's no giant glass or ... yeah the way it's set up it's a wonder she's the only person who's falling but during the time and goodness that's a bad day wow yeah at least you don't\nHave and that kind of day right and that's it that's the kind of person she should get out now she should play the lottery 'cause I think she would deserve to after she falling into the shark tank during feeding dime\nTossed might argue we have that type of day every day\n[laughter] defined sharks right [laughter]\nHave fallen in the water when you didn't want to yeah I have fallen into water when I didn't want to but I've never fall and there'd be charged with a shark dire\nYeah obviously soldier I walked out the ... yeah I did too and it happens these candidates so we're doing it in the world and it does slow down and you know you're in most yeah\nAnd you know you can't backup right and you're just hope it for for better on the other side have a great day everybody moved back tomorrow fan [noise]\nAnd if that even if that never happens look at look at the binary in right now where we love to spend more on good projects that have a societal benefit right infrastructure it's being crowded out by ... the debt now look at the drive on yeah absolutely\nHey let's talk about Hoover Hoover ah suggesting that they're going to hire either Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs maybe both bringing up a ... in fact I'll bet you they end up having a whole bunch of uh underwriters yeah half a dozen and\nSuggesting though that the company miraculously is worth a hundred and twenty billion dollars I I I don't know where\nThey're getting that from now I Know I understand folks when Goldman Sachs coast over and says hey we want to be your investors fatter [laughter] they they have to pitch them high price right it's like oh and you're listening you're holding for say right the real ... all worth a fortune John I can get you a million for this place I've never seen a place so not yeah [laughter]\nYeah so yeah the the plan is here for a loop or to go public in the next year if I were an order next year if I was that might be hurrying up because the the ideal market is very strong I speak on\nFirst hand experience here that they're hard to get there being priced aggressively and they're doing very well and the after market or so after a big drop a couple of years ago and valuation whoever has in their defense really right right of the ship\nGood CEO but why would I buy them\nWhen I'm looking at General Motors and I'm looking at ... and I'm saying\nThese are two companies that are on the cusp of self driving technology ... rolling out self driving taxis in Cuba for this year ... you you I'll take I'll take the other side and I I I don't necessarily\nDisagree with you but the argument would be there's other people doing that and it's ... it's it's important but Wilbur has a very fantastic advantage in terms of what they do as far as\nScale being in a lot of places\nHaving a model that now works quite well people like it people like it you know if you gave me a hundred billion dollars and said\nBuild a new ... I think I'd say beret had better things to do with your money I think it would be very hard to beat them and General Motors is great Ford is great but there's a lot of people that make really nice cars but doesn't Hoover half to come out and say yeah we're going public but we also have this joint venture we're we're doing it with ... because it got to get rid of the drivers\nThe drivers are killing them yet and I I think what's going to happen is the driver's going to get slowly phased out I think the ... ... uh ten years five ten years Fifteen Years up and right above the questions right away what what kind of threat is this the next couple of years bottom line is they'll remember what we're going to use that technology to its advantage\nWe can argue about who's going to win the battle for technology whether it's gonna be way more whether it's going to be you know GM's project which is which is doing really well but I Am a funny feeling was what was going to be the customer that in that the argument we're we're going to make is\nWe are the leader in this and it's a very hard not to crap if you've ever tried to compete with us what about list\nThey have done well maybe you're driving by the way are driving both yeah you're right is this coke and Pepsi I mean this may not be an either or this may be a a venue where Wilbur and lift ... having really well but I have a funny feeling ... maybe the customer that in that the argument we're we're going to make is\nWe are the leader in this and it's a very hard not to crap if you've ever tried to compete with us about list\nThey have done well maybe I lose lift you what do you use Tucker I switched over to less really cheaper\nLightly slightly cheaper and cheaper is this the doo wop ally is this little guys that are driving by the way are driving both yeah you're right is this coke and Pepsi I mean this may not be an either or this may be a a venue\nWhere Wilbur and lift ... have essentially a ... you know they try to be the number three guy it it it will be very well the the thing that the reason\nI'd be hesitant to buy rubber on the appeal is way more ... I I'm scared to death of Google but they're not going directly in competitions you're there they're going rolling out self ... they just ordered sixty thousand taxis\nSo they've got the technology to do it and they've got that and they ordered the cars but can they execute a ... point that's a great point that's a sign of national international Rosen Paris\nEverybody used over right it tax isn't it the the value of a taxi medallions and Paris has diminished the same degree as it has in New York City while\nThe people love over I'll tell you though I I think there's a a a good use [laughter] my son is taking up a business course an MBA at Boston University and he turned me onto this concept in business which really is I think an overriding concept\nThe value of companies today is largely based on their platforms and the platform that ... has I think has an immense amount of value\nAnd they can use that platform to expand their business and they can use this in by this technology if they need to but would you\nRather have the platform or the technology good question I'd like that but I Do and yeah and and I think the question is can ... developed the platform faster than Hoover can develop the technology\nWill and will ... will do a mole license their technology the way more numerous way mo was a huge investor in ...\nRight and then Kalanick screwed them and and now they're they're I now I don't know ... are they back in bed together\nWhere we're at least something great question or because they can both be successful in their own way but they might not be successful and what the other guy does way back to what you could say hey we're gonna licenses technology to list we're going to visit taxi dot com you're going to license it\nTo a ... license everybody can as some stupid your way mo is Google yeah crooked yeah wholly owned a shop but they they are\n... you know if if if you talk to people in the transportation business\nThey will tell you that ... is light years ahead of everybody else although General Motors reportedly is is right up there I Hope so but yeah I mean General Motors may in fact General Motors may roll out a separate IP oh\nOf the driverless division and by the way it's got to be pretty good because Honda signed up as an investor in that Prague broad and I I've heard some people say General Motors is actually a head of ...\nIn the technology I had not heard that there are some people believe that when we come back we'll be talking about the job market if you're looking for work\nThere's no excuses lots of jobs out there that's next on the financial exchange your whole\nBreaking financial news so financial exchange with very Armstrong in chunks out on the financial exchange radio network\nHi this is very Armstrong amazingly over twenty percent of Americans have said nothing for their retirement can you imagine you're sixty five and you haven't saved a nickel hopefully\nNone of you listening today or in that boat but whatever you save for retirement I'd like to help you devise a strategy that will allow you to enjoy your later years my new guide out this month will help you learn strategies to help manage your portfolio and protected so that when it's time for you to retire your assets\nCan be there to work for you retirees have to worry about a lot of things will your money last kind of cover your expenses if you don't know the answers to these questions called me right now at eight hundred three nine three\nFour zero zero one request a copy of this brand new guide how to develop a retirement income strategy that eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one or download it right now on our website Armstrong advisory dot com\nSecurities offered the securities America incorporated remember finger essay PC and advisory services offered their security is American visors incorporated very Armstrong representative Armstrong advisory group and the securities America companies are unaffiliated you hear the stories\n\nAnd the conversation began inciting violence there is going to be an assassination if you're talking about it I don't think you can go back from the turning them out right here we're now seeing is radicalized America I guess I just saw\nThat for anybody on the voice of Boston [noise] W.

looks like a fantastic day the Dow up two hundred twelve points the NASDAQ up Seventy five\nS P up twenty three all green arrows so what was the last week last week was not I give you guys one week like take one week's vacation I Know where to go I think I Am I'm sitting there and like what the\nHeck you know my wife and I were talking about that as we watched the market crater I said you know berries over there in France saying [laughter] and I might well rapes and you know I mean it was ... no no he's probably enjoying a nice French dinner and not even paying dish I said you don't know [laughter]\nShe needed to press the guy got to get back but the problem is the market doesn't close over there to like ten or eleven o'clock [laughter] you have to suffer like twice as much you wouldn't be here but the bottom line is great day today mark it up to twenty six\nYou know earnings have come to the rescue in this glass half full or glass half empty in our concerns about everything and there's everything geopolitical interest rates you name it one thing that's really good news is earning camp which are very good that can be up about Twenty one percent this quarter over twenty percent of the year\nAnd Goldman Sachs which is a bellwether came through with set would fantastic earnings the banks came through with good earnings\nSo we're getting some reassurance that at least in terms of what's going on up there in the real world that matters\nThere's really good ... and ... you know you bats that's ultimately what's going to drive the price of stocks at the end of the day it's measuring earnings and then just we got to keep an eye on interest rates because that's the gravity that can kinda keep prices from going to want higher so we want to keep an eye on that a lotta\nGiven go here you know uh in the next next year\nKnown as for its lobsters and light houses and Maine also has one of the oldest populations in the United states the median age in the state of Maine John his forty three and around five years older than the rest of the country to attract younger workers\nMain is providing tax credits to student loan borrowers what a brilliant strategy I think it's absolutely brilliant\nAnd you know we say that maybe this is the power of these and states and governments need to take a page from private enterprise and find out what it is people do in the real world to attract people and keep people and get people to come work for you\nOne of the things you hear in private enterprise is people want to have help with their student loans and you know main is offering student loan help to people who live in Maine and work in the state and I I just think it's a great idea because they the population is getting older you know people are moving out there\nThey're trying to encourage smart people just stay in you you go to vote in college you go to ... stay here you go to ... stay here and and we'll pay your student loans for the way the program works if you're not familiar with it\nIs it's a tax credit program so if you're paying two hundred dollars a month in student loans and the end of the year when you file your tax return your state tax return has pretty high income taxes\nYou're going to get a tax credit huh equal to the amount or those student loans up to two hundred bucks more if you're a stem major like if you're a science technology major you can get more but that's that's a like most kids when they graduate college are going to have student loan payments\nYou know the kids I Know if you've got forty thousand dollars and your student loan payment on that might be anywhere from two to three hundred three hundred and fifty bucks a month\nSo far the sudden state of Maine Spain that for you and you you get a job offer in Portland yet right you know say hey Portland nice city\nGood place to live maybe a nice place to raise a family and if nothing else they're going to pay my student loans\nAnd think about what that means for Portland for or from Maine I mean if that person making eighty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars you look at that state tax next year ... year after year after that you'll get the fact that you're probably going to own a home we paying a property tax is going to help your community\nA at a time when they're losing people it makes a lot of economic sense and we talk about the fact that private employers are now offering is sometimes in lieu of four one K. matches or in addition to four one K. matches this type of program to help students with their debt and we're seeing survey after survey\nOf people coming out of college saying they're number one worry\nIs paying that loan I think about it right you your graduate from a Wentworth you graduate from northeastern Yale whatever your date and if you have an opportunity to go work for a biotech company in Cambridge\nAnd they're going to say to you or will pay the first three hundred dollars a month later student loans she was that's hard to turn down\nAnd it's a smart move on their part to do that so\nYou know kudos to Maine for doing this uh sometimes you know\nA necessity is the mother of invention yeah and a lot of times when you push to go back to the wall you do the things you probably need to do and you come up with creative ways to get by and\nYou know main is dealing with a crisis like you said the average age the median age being forty three uh that is not good news because that means people were younger or leaving this will help yeah absolutely a big impact it you know the problem is\nWe report on it today won't have an impact for ten Fifteen Years true but it it does send a powerful message though if I'm you know a a college kid or or even high school kid in Maine and I'm thinking about do I want to settle down and work in the financial industry in Portland where there's plenty of find places to work or to want to relocate and go to Boston\nI tell you what Rhode Island should be doing something like yeah yesterday ... road I this is something yeah great schools down there yeah and and they should be doing a program like that absolute amazingly folks over twenty percent of

boys so Boston the financial exchange show does come and sign up today [noise]\nHere's their investment offers to the energy especially cleaner energy Jennifer warrant is seeking alpha Jennifer thanks for joining us\nYou're welcome thanks for having me\nJennifer Shannon Armstrong is interesting has a huge yield and performing very nicely last five years what is it exactly they do\n[noise] um they invest then um what they called pro climatic assets that have hot positive greenhouse gas profile meeting\nPlenty cleaner energy infrastructure as well as um like water conservation infrastructure can also be energy efficiency projects um renewables like solar and wind\nUm so it's a it's a large variety of asset assets related to clean energy and better use of resources\nAs it relates to climate change and sustainability\nCan we think of handling as almost an energy investment fund that seeks out smart energy investments\nThey they do they write the checks for these investments will come\nThey are the and invest or and and also offer services to the top engineering companies and the world I'm so they have deep and long relationship with the various engineering firms\nAnd that is kind of like like a cornerstone of their business so it's a reliable pipeline of projects that are high quality um\nBut yet the the the stock itself has a huge dividend yield to more than double the market to me that's often times of red flag what is the risk that the markets sees in this investment that uh maybe others might not see\n'em you know I think the stock went down like a year ago and in the last year and a half because of the changing interest rate environment and I think I'm the market has had a hard time classifying exactly what had an Armstrong does some\nUm put it in the commercial mortgage rate pocket other an infrastructure read back at 'em it's classified as a ... but I just consider it an infrastructure play cleaning cleaner infrastructure and I think\nThe market opportunity is large going forward and um the risks are you know the risk to any\nStock in general is that you know if we had a recession you know maybe maybe there's not as many projects an infrastructure that would be a downside um however because they're in a state where they invest in smaller size projects\nI think that's actually a competitive advantage for them relative to um maybe other types of infrastructure investors or or engineering and ... you know\nThis is to be more of like being under rocks and under a cloud which is a good thing a lot of times that's undetected a value yes let's turn over to actually Pete occidental petroleum much better known obviously a while you like the traditional oil play\nWell I like them first because I mean they've done quite well\nEven with the downturn we had an oil prices they um had strictly it had a load 'em they've always they've paid a very good to have it in and I'm like the last Fifteen Years they've had a twelve percent continues annual growth and their dividend it's north of four percent\nUm they're conservative um even when you have a considerable amount of Permian Basin acreage which is yeah the hot kind of oil producing area\nAnd even then they approached um fracking conservatively but now they're now one of the yeah they had some of the best well\nBut what I also like about them and they're diversified um they have ... a can of a chemical business and export capabilities\nWhen I was at that price of oil do they need to make to make solid profits\nUm they they in a fifty dollar re why um that that's where they\nThey they do fine on that kind of their break even threshold for us but um yeah and so in oil prices are in a decent rain and and that's really not expect that to change you know considerably I think even\nLet's just say hypothetically we had a recession and a year or two I just don't see oil prices I'm going down to the level that they did during the sort\nOf my not
