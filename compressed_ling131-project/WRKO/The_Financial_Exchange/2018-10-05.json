of San Francisco having a major problems with the fact that there are streets are too\nDirty and they're combating that and trying to clean them up and one of the biggest complaints that the residents of San Francisco have is that there is dog poop everywhere and and as a resident of south Boston I can completely understand that because there's\nDog poop all over south Boston as well\n... says they get up to sixty five ... calls a day about ... dog poop and so they've decided that they're going to fix that by creating an app for your phone and you can go right on the up and take a picture of dog poop and send it to the city with the address where it is in the city will come get ... would you like to know the ap was called\nSnap crap [laughter] I was gonna say oh crap out there a\nApp for

you get those songs I Do not get all the songs I did not but I get them quickly I Know that's okay that's okay I just uh I was going to just do this is my last word they are the ultimate classic rock\nDid a our ranking of the hundred and Seventy two journey song [noise]\nDid you know they had a hundred and Seventy two songs they had to\nTop three I mean if you were gonna yes what is the number one song from journey what is the number one song from turning\nA faithful in\nKnow your Sopranos on don't stop believing or whatever\nOne of the ... and I\nWorry about any way you want it that would be my favorite over there is but I wouldn't put that number one for them for people that rank these things I wouldn't think they would put that number one but that\nThe number one journey song according to this website is feeling that way [noise]\nLife what way in my field\nDo you do you remember that song baby don't think I Do I'm not the world's biggest journey fan but\nI don't think I even really know that a ... you\nMight have to go down the hall or a friend in the election and ask them about this for\nThe yeah I just I mean this is a big June ... yeah I mean the one\nThat you think of them you see lights or you don't stop believing or\nWhat they thought that this was\nThis was something I didn't know that was what as I said I'm an artist\nAnd maybe it's because the the other songs\nHave survived along with that\nIt was when it was there but [noise]\nThey go by the way 'til you got eight and I guess but this has all of journey in it because it has the power ballad it does have the rocky period it is\nI guess the best and kept solution on them that's actually use that as you didn't read this right now that's very impressive\nBecause that is that is what exactly what they say about the song and that's why they think that while it what may not have been the biggest money maker for them this one encapsulated in the band\nHis big band is I ever knew that had to split personality I mean they were hard rock band for time and they were very good at it\nAnd then they became just an hour and then they kind of funny because\nYou do dishes lightened is almost when I looked at this list and I saw that I was thinking this is almost like the Academy Awards in that it's if you're a big box office smash you cannot be the winner\nOf the movie of the Everytime it

an okay Joan again I don't mean to here in for another Fifteen Years but [noise]\nI mean anywhere you want it is probably my favorite of theirs but that's just a straight hard rock through manages to kick ass bar rip it off but that's not really journey\nJourney was more than that and they were all different phases so what's the worst one\nOr the what the deal with them you would do one on one hand I I I'm not sure they are it out and he's back in the aerobic albums lately I don't know it was real songs and you would only known for them right like if it wasn't even a good album sometimes you would only do one or two but\nSome arena in our last minute the U.S something today\nAbout the box office heads they're coming out this weekend which we kind of touched on a little bit earlier in the week about some of the big movies that are hitting theater is of course a star is born which I I myself will be saying that later tonight I'm really excited about it just now yes venom and then as well as the other movie that died in the top three is that they hate him gifts\nHearing about that one that's going to be kind of an interesting movie that is basically about uh it's really politically charged it about this young African American couple uh like teenagers and they get stopped by a police officer and\nThe man unfortunately gets fatally shot she witnessed as that and then you kinda get and how the rest of it unfold how she handles that\nBut yeah so those are the three top films that are hidden theaters and you can see the trailers on our website W ... [noise]\nDo have tickets to see [noise]\nI'm In the process of getting them ready to say you get them quick because that's going to be one of those that there's going to be a line yeah and I'm going to see that and try to go to a late one to some of my friends don't get out of work to leaders I mean\nI Try not I mean the good news is where you're going anything yeah my wife was doing his right you're going to order them now but you can and you can pick your seat and you don't have to worry about ... ...\n... she going to say it's an event might be able to say the same way I guess as you will because you're you're not only for either\nYeah I I might have to go to a later one just because like a couple of my friends don't get out of work until later and by the time they get around and get up there not till later so we'll see I mean I might be going to\nLike a nine or ten o'clock I don't know if you don't have a seven year my ... depends on the ticket so yeah I see her that way I did\nI did do this thing\nThat could really like to see it with you and I said I was really proud of myself I don't think she's ...\nAnd that would be awesome\nBut you know that would be at least three hours of the babysitter and boy does that up because I Love to take you to dinner too so maybe you know your friend is going to Nashville and this would be a good way to jumpstart that she's like that's true and I was like\nMan look at you mail Lynch looking at you like Cooper singing this yeah\nDie Bradley Cooper is on the billboard pop truck right now because he has a ... he was actually a good that's cool that's off later and now I'm definitely going to go I unfortunately can't ...\nYou should go into your friend I think you may hear marinas future wedding song tired if you go see that I may\nHave a great weekend everybody will be back Monday\nVoice of Boston New York about one other point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] thirty minutes until the cloture vote good morning\nOf really you know continuing to slow down real estate markets we've seen slowing price growth in them to this point\nBut also you know potentially if you're talking about people who may have taken out adjustable rate mortgages myself included I have an adjustable rate mortgages and people who might have credit card that people might have adjustable you know there's there's a whole bunch of different areas where you might have adjustable loans out there the costs for those people are going to start moving up as a result of this\nCity I I think we ... we all get very concerned about rising interest rates and what the Fed's going to do next and\nIt's important can be concerned about it and it will impact financial markets\nIt's also important to keep in mind keep in mind you know where we are in terms of historical norms it you can still go get a mortgage right now for under four and a half percent you can still not not so much and I mean I guess a Thirty Years' pie averaging right about four and a half your ears or eight right now I'm thirty I'm\nIn a in terms of historical norms we're still pretty low interest rates and I I think that this economy could still absorb\nYou know a little bit higher interest rates at this point I don't think you are in I don't think you're in danger of you know if let's say the fed does hike rates three you know one more time this year and the times last year next year I don't think you're in danger of a financial meltdown that that'd be pretty par for the course\nKnown it it it's not a case where rates necessarily lead to that melt down a but it is a case where they likely do lead\nTo some continued slowing in the U.S economy ... and and that's something that when you take into account the overseas picture you sit there and say gee you know it doesn't necessarily paint the prettiest picture looking out twelve to Eighteen months if we take a look at the ...\nAbility for December rate hike now back before this was announced would go back just a day ago it was about Seventy seven percent chance that we saw a hike\nOr in December we're now up to an eighty six percent chance so you know this is pretty much saying hey look the cake isn't quite baked yet for December and that rate hike\nBut it's getting pretty close to this is another strong data point that likely points in that direction and probably you know all but assures us that we're getting that hike in uh in December up to between two and a quarter and two and a half percent that's where\nA the fed is likely going to be targeting short term rates than\nSay your production had been I Believe for for rate hikes this year and two for next year is that accurate I'm On the one to two next year okay and I'm On team two to three next year it has this report change anything for you\nKnow I'm Still I'm Still thinking that the international stuff is going to be enough that it results in a a a slowdown especially some of the data that we got in the last couple of days I've I've hooked on the south Korea number just because\nThey are a major manufacturing and exporting center and their exports year over year for August redound eight point six percent that's that's not a small shift that you see there the last time we saw a numbers like that from South Korea was back in the store to twenty sixteen when you had the energy sector completely falling apart\nLet let's play is jammed pulled out a little bit further I don't mean to get too deep into hypothetical but let's say that we do see three rate hikes next year and a you know by the time December twenty Nineteen rolls around\nLet's imagine that us interest rates are significantly higher than other developed market interest rates will they already are keeping my they already are today that but that would you know really inflate things if uh you know the global economy Europe continue to stagnate and us to come to continue to raise interest rates ... what does that do to the global economy what concerns do we have than about\nThe U.S and global economy is and how people behave and those scenarios\nWith a big thing that you're already seeing is in emerging markets you're seeing this this effectively dollar shortage that is a creeping up there and what happens there pretty much is ... you effectively have people who ... they're trying to buy dollars because their own currencies are falling\nAnd what it does is it continued it creates a cycle where the dollar strengthens making it more difficult for people who own other currencies to buy it and it really can can create a slowdown in some of these emerging economies um so it's it has some really nasty short term effects there and and that's why when I look at you know one of the things that does concern me\nIt is to a certain extent dollar strength because dollar strength\nYou know makes it so that you have capital flight out of these emerging economies and in today's world you know that does have a very real impact on the overall global trade so sure I look at it and and that's part of the reason why I think the fed is only able to hike one more time next year\nI think another piece there of the puzzle is the overall ... interest expense that the U.S is paying this was going to continue the ... into the budget as far as our ability to finance our deficit and pay for other programs\nAre especially since you don't have a lot of international appetite for us bonds right now yeah yeah it's a legitimate concern there's there's some stuff that's out there that I worry about\nUh let's take a quick break here when we come back you know move away from jobs and we're going to start talking spy chips not pita chips potato chips but we're going to start talking spy chips

their Ilan\nWhat's going on with Cosco I Know they reported earnings yesterday they are currently down about two point six percent what what'd you glean from them\nSo ... there's going to be more to come on this eh costs co reported the fourth quarter earnings are right in line to thirty six to share the basically in line with expectations but they said that they expect to report material weakness in their internal controls and\nUh ... what does that mean yeah that's the big question uh it it could mean a number of things that could mean that some sort of accounting was done incorrectly but they did say that they don't believe that er they they'd been going through things and said they haven't found any incorrectly reported financial statements yet\nUm but material witness an internal control means to me that there was something wrong with your financial reporting documents we don't know exactly where it is but you don't know where it is they haven't said that they found it so it's possible that there'll be nothing it'll be possible they say\nYou know we found a weakness in our controls but it actually didn't lead to any issues it's also I think more likely that they're going to disclose that there was some sort of corruption that they need to make the prior earnings or something along those lines so we'll see what Pasco comes up with your but obviously that sort of ambiguity not great for the stock\nNo it's it's it's not really ideal it's not the kind of thing that you want\nTo see their let's talk a little bit about this report a out of the wall Street Journal auto makers considering moving some more manufacturing or to North America and this was on the heels of\nA affective we be revised trade agreement likely being approved in a in the U.S Canada and Mexico but we've got representatives from BMW and dime we're at the very least saying hey we're probably gonna have to move more production into these countries which was the exact aim of the Trump Administration in pursuing these kinds of\nYeah I mean it shouldn't be surprising if you want to avoid a tariff now you need to move more of your manufacturing here in North America so\nThe new tentative deal which has not been put into place yet uh does require automakers to build at least Seventy five percent of cars value within North America that used to be sixty two and a half percent so that's you know up a good was that twelve and a half percent\nIt also requires that forty to forty five percent the vehicle is made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour or so that you know limits you uh that that does limit you in terms of where you can be putting these cars and assembling\nAnd uh so what are we going to workers for this uh Mexico\n[laughter] ... it might actually be that you see the net effect this might just be that you know U.S companies have already invested billions of dollars in New Mexico plants they might just raise the new raise the wages to those to those workers there rather than relocating some of these jobs will have to say\nLet's talk about a drunk birds and yes I I I ... those are words I never thought I Would say in my life when

first thought is this just seems like the kind of thing that is like the the first scene in some kind of apocalyptic movie like nerds losing all sense of direction and flying into windows and stuff like that but what's what's actually happening\nIn your mind that birds are ingesting berries that have fermented apparently earlier than usual because of an early frost in Minnesota\nAh and because of that birds have been flying into cars windows or you know to really as you mentioned losing their sense of direction and it's been apparently a bit of a concerning apocalyptic messed in northern

I'm Talking to us about the financial impact of the ... the playoff series that we got the red Sox at home to fight against the Yankees are we were just taking a look at tickets by the way it looks like he can still get tickets for about a hundred bucks a and then going up from there\nBut uh you know Brad we had you on I think back in February talking to us about the impact to the super bowl a and it seemed like it was pretty muted in terms of ah you know most cities saying hey we're going to be throwing parties at home and you know restaurant sales not really seeing much of an increase how does that compare it to a playoff series in the end all be\nSure are very different actually we see a pretty significant increase in a number of business categories but just to kind of recap how we do to a wobbly we\nCarry a transaction data for millions of small businesses that powers the software that are small businesses use but it also gives us an interesting look into all these patterns that are going on in local market in different states around transactions between\nConsumers and small businesses and those that either so for example we can look at last year's performance or four different business categories in towns where I'm a ... where there is a major league team in the play offs and the what the impact as to what we did is our data science team normalized\nOr what the average day for revenue looked like in the three months prior to the playoffs and then compared\nA timeframe during the playoffs against that average and what we found was that there was a pretty significant change across the board so ah just looking at a a game day versus non game day on game days all these categories that we analyzed ... thirty two percent increase in sales\nOn non game date you and they thought twenty five percent increase\nAnd then home in a way there wasn't a huge difference on a across the businesses that we analyzed and the difference that ... that were in the last last year was thirty two percent versus a whether they were home or way but there are some like ... different as we look at when you look at specific market like Boston or New York I'm On those different dimension\nBread can you talk a little bit about those a specific differences there\nSo let's take Austin for example so ah there is a major difference in the home versus away average there so again I mentioned at home or if you look at just when the team is home how to restaurants and bars and lounges and lodging businesses\nTransportation business is fair I'm On average a across all the city has thirty two percent increase its Seventy six percent increase in Boston and when there are when the team is the way you still use the uh a bump in those businesses though it's sixty seven percent in Boston\nAnd then again looking at the difference between a game day when the red Sox are playing versus the day when they're not playing during playoff season um there's seven point spread in that game day versus non game day across all cities but in Boston it's much larger it's almost dot twenty five percent that Seventy two percent list on game day forty six percent lift\nOn non game day so in general people are responding to the fact that the team is in the playoffs and actually getting out of the house and spending money with the business the on on a much higher level and across other cities\nBut are you just looking at these ... metro areas as a whole or do you even get you know kind of neighborhood specific in this data\nSo it it's difficult to get really specific because the sample sizes become smaller we tens of thousands of businesses across all these cities but obviously we want to maintain a high bar or\nUm you know the the repeat ability of the data so and the funny that we're finding so in some cases there may be a like a code to have a high concentration of businesses but for this purpose we really just looked at this on a high level we all have to constrain the against\nYou know are these businesses that are are trained acting daily making sure that it's not you know sort of a business that's open all the you know two or three days a week that kind of thing\n[noise] very good bread we've got to run but thanks for joining us today that she got\n... from ... talking about the financial impact of the major league baseball playoffs are on the news that the teams are in we've only got about ten seconds left\nSo talk a little bit about those playoffs he got mad at soccer Yankees Red Sox\nOkay we've got the red Sox Mike oh come on like this isn't even a reasonable you got the Sox got\nSocks and five [noise]\nI'm going section five is well it's all the time we have on this hour we'll be back in just a little bit with a whole lot more financial exchange\n[laughter] the\nProceeding program has been a paint commercial program to W.
