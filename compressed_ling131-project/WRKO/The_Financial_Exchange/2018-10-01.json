I got a ... a and if you look at the pictures you will join me in being like you've got to be kidding me because I'm\nSeeing is so big it was grown in New Hampshire the thing is twenty five hundred pounds and it is gigantic and when someone is standing next to it it's unbelievable\nBut the craziest thing is since we talked about this earlier this morning not only is there are a governing body over the largest growing wish I had no idea\nBut I kind of look this up and like everything in the world pumpkins are just getting bigger because the record was in two thousand nine\nThe record was Seventeen hundred and twenty five pounds and then in two thousand and ten it was Eighteen ten and in has slowly but surely\nGoing up so pumpkins are just getting bigger just like everything you know\nHow to make so bad I mean I don't do a nuclear power plant like how do they get wouldn't\nYou think so did you see the man standing next to it too [laughter] it's ridiculous I mean the thing is gigantic and it's white yeah it is\nI did put a picture up for those who want to see it on W. R. dot com you can see how big that pumpkin is and the man standing next to the pump getting those it's not\nThe biggest in the world the Guinness Book of world records has uh the heaviest pumpkin ever at twenty six hundred and twenty four pounds and that was grown in Belgium packing sixteen two thousand sixteen [laughter] not the biggest ever but it certainly is a very large pumpkin [noise]\nSo they have it and there's a\nSome crazy I don't know if people I've ever seen beer but he wants six thousand bucks to yeah which probably took him to move to dang thing from wherever you screw it they're probably cost him six thousand bucks he probably has a designated pumpkin truck to its she's twenty five hundred bucks you get that that just your pickup [noise]\nYou put twenty five hundred pounds on your back your pardon me for everyone to what he does the trail wires entire trailers behind them yeah\nI guess in a trailer and I mean I've seen pickup trucks that had those like trucks that you carry cars on behind them before well that's true I guess some of them at a lot of historical thanks yeah ...\n[laughter] I just don't envision that you just pick ... you're a twenty five hundred pound\nA pumpkin and throw it into the back of the pickup and head on down to the fair and\nThey used to be a better story in a related outdoors you store but you guys in Alaska shot a barren and happened to be like on a ridge above them and the poor guy like the barrel roll down the hill and landed on them and ...\nNo I didn't hear that yeah wow\nYeah there is ... I think there were twenty eight Nineteen year old just out in Alaska hunting and literally like they saw a bear up on a ridge and the guy shot of it and hit the Baron killed them and the beer literally tumble down the hill and landed on top of them\nOn my door shut with I mean bad the airlift him to a hospital he alive guy but he's alive oh God I was gonna\nSay let me tell you that Mother Nature getting back at you for shooting a bear I think right now you can be questioned and believe it yeah that's that's crazy\nAnd I said that and that's also a really really bad day when you've shot up there and it rolls down the hill and can you not see that coming I don't know that was my thing like how did he not have time to get out of the way here it's like a bell awful and write it on that plane dropped down on him [noise]\nAh my other last word here very quickly as did I Want to get your take did you see Saturday Night live it was we didn't talk about that this morning at all [noise]\nSo I'm forty four season they open a Kanye West was the gas the musical guest\nAnd [laughter]\nThey come out first off with Brett Kavanaugh hearing um skit\nWhich I wondered if they were going to touch that with a ten foot pole and you'll find if you go back and you watch that they don't ... the doctor for words not mentioned and not about such you know sexual assault at all it is just essentially making fun of counting on drinking yeah\nUm but then so we have that's the way the show's open the show ends with Kanye West in his make America great hat on giving a huge speech on the president and then he goes a step further to say that he would support the abolishing the thirteenth amendment which is\nThe myth that if all for it yes [noise]\n[noise] wow maybe he needs to do a little research and maybe he's not clear exactly what the thirteenth man was all about\nAt what point does the president just say Kanye thank you but maybe you should just stop speaking\nTo do with the president said I Know it was in favor he was all for it I heard ...\nI Know I also said he didn't see the show which again this is one of those examples of Mr President don't don't don't make sure you see everything before him I don't believe first second he didn't wash of [noise]\nNot for war second he sounds are part of it [noise]\nKanye West oh boy I gotta I gotta big suggestion for him ... where the where the hat you want to go on a Saturday Night live and sing from your new album you just drop saying otherwise just don't don't do anything else you yourself and for that matter the president a favor\nBecause I mean it's my feeling backfiring on one's alone you actually heard about his music guy and he just dropped an album yeah right\nAll right my friends we got to leave it right there hope you have a great rush to the day again be back in the morning show starts six am hope you trying to say\nBoston you walk working about one hundred point seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] Bush update on the Kavanaugh investigation good morning I'm Nick\nI'm you know if you look you got to hope that they get this one right 'cause honestly if they get it wrong at this point\nYou sit there and you say ... where's this company go then and they're not going to go out of business so this is this is not a company that is hemorrhaging cash but it's a company\nThat needs to figure out how to grow and they're not making enough money to pay their dividend though for it no but that's different from hemorrhaging cash you know you know ... testable is hemorrhaging cash if you are mostly had not gotten this settlement ... there was a problem with you know is that company going to exist\nGE he does not have a problem of have this company going to exist they will that they're not going to go out of business so we don't need to get you know to that point\nBut GE he does have a case where hey if you want to have a future where you're growing and you can attract top talent you got away with a vision to get there and\nOne thing when are we never did and and I was critical from others\nWhat are you going to do with what's going to be that killer was here on it you have that no one else can do we never got an answer to that he never message we never got an answer to that question it was just well we are going to go through a strategic we're told me what you want to do right I mean what you want to do what do you want to be good at\nEven Musk wants to make cars and he settled quite surprisingly on Saturday we had a spirited conversation about Tesla and yuan Musk on friday\nAnd hey Chuck may have been questioning his sanity for turning down to deal with the SEC especially now when you look at the terms of the original offer from the SEC I think it was very generous\nWhat it was it was going to be a ten million dollar fine and he was going to have to step away is the chairman of the board for two years what now happens is that he has to pay at twenty million dollar fine so twice as big Tesla has to pay a twenty million dollar fine as well so now that find becomes four times as big\nHe gets an additional year away from being the chairman of the board so he's got a three year ban on that position\nAnd he also has to have ... ... in quite literally\nTwitter supervision ... he need someone to supervise him when tweeting\nWould likely that maybe he could share somebody with the president you know the president could have ... ... ... it's not a fulltime job right have you seen that much you onto each [laughter] he will be tweeting much now\nBut uh so you will get this and this takes off the table I think the worst case scenario for Tesla which was that they can't fund raise and they're out of business by the spring they still have some hurdles to clear\nBut look this company as a going concern probably is not something that is you know imminent and that this company is going out of business but they still have to figure out how to make cars profitably they still have to figure out you know if they have the demand and every year for four hundred thousand vehicles um and then you know\nWhy does on who they might bring in ... if you heard anything on the rumor mill or which uh the the ... seats that open up or the chairman heroin role that's an important job because it's got to be somebody who is strong enough there's got to be very intelligent and they have to be able to stand up to you on must can say no you're not doing\nDo you think they need to be from this world the the kind of start up high tech world and\nNo I think they don't even think they need to spring manufacturing guy in the like uh somebody from Boeing\nUm what was the guy that ran for for years uh McNally a bomb the mole alley Malawi allowing it can be a good fit their you know somebody that mosque would respect but understands the automobile business in supply chains and and manufacturing because that's\nTheir big issues they make it seem to remember about\nTesla is they make a car in which there's a waiting list you want to buy a Tesla Model S remodeled three there's a waiting list that shows that they've got a good product the problem is they have not been executing and yet somebody who's been proven winner in that capacity Aloul he's probably too old he's got to be close to eighty now I\nQuestion though the waiting list though\nMan who or what they're still not making cars for thirty five thousand there's been a lot of people turning turning down the ability to get all your waiting list because the only ones they're selling a forty five thousand an up and people are saying look I don't want to get I didn't want to buy a fifty two thousand dollar ... but you still can't get a fifty two thousand dollars [laughter] watch go out go out to next fall a year from now\nI don't know if you have much of a waiting list and\nAnd and that's the question that I always had his okay great you're gonna sail five hundred thousand of these\nDo you have the demand for five hundred thousand more every year right 'cause that's what they were saying and and I I question that because when you look at the vehicles people are buying today the most popular vehicles out there aren't the Toyota Corolla and the camera and the Honda Accord and the Ford Fusion\nIt's not what people are buying today right people were buying route fours they're buying Honda see RVs\nThey're buying Nissan rogues and tested doesn't offer anything that competes with those anywhere near that\nPrice explain what this nine hundred and twenty million dollar convertible bond coming due and march is this is a big one is is\nYou know I think what may have happened I think I think he won must probably really wanted to fight the SCC and and I think what may have happened is the financial ramifications of that fight may have dawned on him because he's worth what twenty thirty billion dollars in that ballpark much of it is tied up in Tesla's stock\nIt is I think he probably recognize that she you know this stock could go to twenty bucks a share in which case I'm wiped out in terms of my network\nSo here's the big funding question that testable has they have they have this nearly nine hundred or nearly billion dollar\nConvertible bond that comes through in March splits a convertible bond so pretty much the way it works if the stock is above a certain price it simply converts into stock and they don't have to roll over and repay that debt they don't have to write a check for no they don't mind hunger related comes it comes to knocking boom you don't have to worry about you know refinancing and\nIf it is below a certain price though that that does effectively expire and they have to go and raise capital in order to pay that off in his shoe new debt\nThat's a tough but that means they have to raise their prices their stock is up sixteen percent today Chuck and in order to avoid writing the check it has to go to three hundred and sixty bucks\nYeah so there are three o seven to share right now they've got to get north of three sixty effectively in order for this to convert to equity and for them to not have to raise additional capital it's it's a real question I've been talking about this for about six months now if the stock is below that price it's going to be a little bit of a challenge for them to raise that\nCapital speculation guy you know you get you get a chairman who's an adult right yet is Sheryl Sandberg somebody that that can run in and work with the lawn [laughter]\nAnd then you get another investor yet apple that says well we're going to buy a hundred billion dollars worth of the stock and and we're going to be a big player in tests or we're going to allow hundred billion dollars company is only worth fifty\nYeah my hundred well let's see how they buy chunk of Tesla right enough to get control the board or it wouldn't cost that wouldn't have much\nWouldn't happen why not just you on still controls so much of the company he's still got thirty percent of the company [noise] yeah but he's his powers the neutered [noise]\nSomewhat you know it's again this is this is a it just slightly big deal but it's like there's not a whole lot that is going to change here in my opinion be watching your new boards like I look at it and I I go you won't get off the lightly\nTo chairman oh he did get a very lightly but the chairman role I think is is really going to be interesting to watch I I if they do that right\nThen that could be a ... that could spell success for the company 'cause it would also it would lay the fears of investors they'd say okay would you do you eat we got it right we got a ... type person in there or\nDo you got to get someone who's going to come in and not take any crap from Milan right and and that's going to be it's going to be tough to find because you on his ... you know whether you like him or hate him he's for medical you know most people don't like and most people don't like working with him\nYeah it's it it it is you still get his executive is going to be interesting to see who they can get to come in and fill that role because it's it's a tough task\nUp next we'll be talking about what used to be called NAFTA it's no longer called NAFTA everything is thinking about changing the name to parks and tacos\nWhat about the United states would be good at\nYou know we've got to think of something you've got to ... tacos in football so I don't know we'll

I'm I'm trying to go through and just you know it's it's tough because then that manufacture you know you you do want somebody probably as manufacturing\nI Would think so I Would think automobile manufacturing myself you know maybe bringing a German I like I even though it was like a ...\nI Will get it also do you know that's the first place that you look what are the issues with Tesla all manufacturing related\nThink a lot of them I think they've got great innovation in terms of their product right so I don't think you have this I I don't think people are going to say well the the products terrible he I think you have to say how do we make the product I mean I looked at the head count to build\nA Tesla versus the headcount to build a Cadillac and it was a multiple Chuck I think it's like sixteen or Seventeen people touched every Tesla and I think it was four or five people were touching every Cadillac\nTesla's biggest problem right now his credibility I think that is as big if not a bigger problem than the manufacturing is just because they've always had manufacturing issues ...\nRight but yet like in order to be profitable you have to overcome those you've got to bring your expenses down they only have one facility that they manufacture them I I think\nIt's just how complex their vehicles are you know when you when you design you know an SUV that instead of having normal doors they open you know these ... it's like what the heck are you that was a dumb design decision but that's but again that's not a manufacturing problem that's why we decided we wanted to say okay we need to be that cool like they got a credibility problem they\nWhat they've never delivered a single product on time and under budget I Know never\n[noise] why more Social Security recipients will see a real raise\nIn twenty Nineteen we're estimating that the raise is going to be what two and a half to three percent price somewhere in that ballpark yeah so that means if the average payment is fourteen hundred dollars ego three percent already five bucks yeah they you know the the unknown is\nIs how much Medicare part B\nAnd Medicare part D as in David will increase this year plus your met a gap coverage ... is typically a retiree is paying Medicare part B a there and at least Medicare part D ... and David so how if those two premium increases are modest then maybe they'll be okay [noise]\nYeah it's it's it's likely going to be the case that additional Medicare premiums eat up a chunk of that extra forty five dollars might be anywhere from a third to half of it then you get an extra twenty five bucks a month hey maybe your ... policy eats up a decent chunk of that as well so\nYou might end up getting an extra ten to Fifteen bucks a month when he finally made it out right it's not a lot right\nWell we are those announces when we get the I think it's in October that we get the Medicare and now I Believe\nSo I don't know the exact date that we get them I think if if sometimes hunters and energy data for weeks yeah now\nRight [laughter] a red ink floods the eye peel market this is a danger sign for stocks in my estimation [laughter] more than ... percent Chuck of us listed initial public offerings and this year the first three quarters\nInvolve companies that lost money in the twelve months leading up to their debut so just think about it you're you're getting all excited about buying stock in a company is going public\nEye and you know a lot of ... come to mind because of where we're located but eighty percent of them are losing money we haven't seen numbers like this in a long time\nKnow in in this speaks to a fundamental change that we've seen in markets in the last decade um because this this is different from what we've seen previously there there's always some companies that IPO's when they're losing money I mean it's part of the game like occasionally you see that\nBut what's interesting now is it's not just that you have companies that are losing money as they go public or\nHi I'm Carrie Fisher how to tell you about another ... should check out it's called ... because every week I talked to a tech immediate key players about how they're changing our world I interviewed tech executive like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg political figures like Hillary Clinton and media personalities like John Kerry you\nLiterally wrote the book I'm Darren out once again the name of the show is Rico decode hosted by me Kara Swisher you can listen to it on I heart rainy or wherever you get your podcasts CNN\nThey connected all the time on all the social sold all links to all the info connective at ... dot com\nShow well your financial exchange radio network\n[laughter]\nWell retirement may not be too far away for you and I saw an article by Lorrie Cornish CNBC they've talked about retirees going back to school good morning Laurie welcome to the show\nThat morning thank\nYou so what ah why would a retiree you after they've wound down their career ended up going back to college at the conclusion of their working career\nWell running retirees who are you know having unfair as hiring today are active they are looking to stay engaged from one of the way of making sure that it by continuing education\nSo it turns out that there's many options for someone who's looking to see that and the good news is that it doesn't have to cut you a fortune\n... immigrants out yes some schools actually allows seniors to audit the classes free of charge that the\nCommunity colleges there are programs that are available that you that you know\nAnd what's this ... program though I was reading the it's a ... actually Berkshire community college ... lifelong learning Institute\nThe ocean or lifelong learning ... is a network of one hundred twenty two year colleges and universities across the country\nThat receive grant during that Bernard a shirt foundation and it's really a lifelong learning programs that allow you to become a number\nAnd then take classes throughout the year so these are classes that you know members that like at Berkshire for example around six dollars an hour early or a membership and then ... ... dollars are class\nSo it's really a fraction of the costs that among might\nPay if they were you know going back to school to ... get that get the there are programs that where you're not doing that but you're engaged in learning and won't ... people\n... ... when I was in college I remember a number of my professors were retired CEOs I went to business school and they were you know the retired CEO of maybe Kodak or something like that are you seeing colleges and universities embrace retirees as professors are instructors\nAt these lifelong learning and it um\nIt many times it inside of the teachers so they are engaged in planning the programming and that kind of teachers and they also you know encourage mentor ship so if there's someone who's a retired lawyer for example they might\nHelp you connect with someone who wants to ... that career so that you can provided by to them and throw it to help them along as they curse that career\nVery interesting that sounds like this is the future of retirement\nGoing back to college I\nMean it sounds like a lot of fun for the people I talk to you know there was a woman who had a career and theater and was able to continue to not only teach her arm another woman who had to retire earlier than she thought and because of the medical condition but was able to\nReally stay engaged by I'm taking classes and told me she would have been ... that had she not found the program that's gum others have met in our new spouses through the program\nUm people really get very involved in finding a community a through this that they're\nThey're able to do you have to join a fraternity now no and you don't have to join a fraternity guy although\nI'm sure if you are a number of turn it in a fraternity exists on the campus that you um you know are taking classes on you're probably can connect with them as well\nYeah that was just like a homecoming right they go to ... you see all the old guys come back to the frat house so thank you very much for your time or appreciate it linked them at ... would you call the uh the geriatric fraternity could it could have a special name\nFor it they already made a movie about this with all your but boy blue [laughter]\nGreen blue is like I think you were like eighty nine as Obama if he died in the movie that could happen and you could happen\nOr pull question today is do you think oil will hit one hundred dollars per barrel by January thirty first of next year\nI don't know it's ... that that seems like a walked for it to go where where's will now eighty four is another big January thirty first\n'cause that would be about the most miserable time it could happen okay you know in terms of your misery index for oil right you're you're burning the got oiled truck if

D. to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] ready to bring in\nGood morning I'm Nick Bovey W. R. K.\nO. news there is a new agreement covering trade among the U.S Mexico and Canada and President Trump thinks it's wonderful NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander reports\nYou've got what is in effect the same countries but a different name the United states\nDone you're out of here you know it might just be something where he eventually reached the level where he couldn't cut it at that level you see it\nYou see the sports and also a lot of give you the example of you will get football teams yeah there are a lot of guys out there that are really good often for defensive coordinators that just can't be had coaches you know it's not any of it it's not a criticism of them it's\nI Will get a guy you know like Wade Philips who has had to add coaching jobs didn't do particularly well either one but it but he really phenomenal defensive coordinator flattery might be that guy where he says look put him in charge of a division give them clear directives and he can execute perfectly but he might not have the vision to be used to you know it might not have the personality to be one\nSo I look at the last three had Welsh and melt inflammatory all insiders now you go outside the company [noise]\nOf had to do in this case right you think yeah I I think you had to I mean this is when when you\nHave a situation like this where you need you need to get people excited in thinking different wing of the same thinking hasn't worked for the last Twenty years maybe everybody pretty much since jak wealth left that things have tons of steadily gone downhill it hasn't been a very pretty picture I think you had to look ... turn on this one\nWell they uh they certainly did copper extends it's losing streak and the third quarter somewhat of a surprise when you say oh I'm In what way ... you think about\nUh you know the the uh the advent of electric cars they use a lot of copper though I'm more copper and those products seat think housings pretty strong but\nEvidently may maybe manufacturing is not as strong as we were led to believe I think\nThe the big thing when you look at who uses the most cop or is it is China\nUm they account for about half of the world's copper demand largely because of all the construction that's going on there in China's growth has been slowing over the last couple years exacerbated a little bit this year by the trade war going on between the U.S and China we've talked about the impact\nThat these tariffs have on the Chinese economy simply because they export so much to the United states and I think that's been a key reason why you're seeing some slack and in demand in ... uh cycling topper demand coming from China in this\nCase here is a good point do you call it the ... China manufacturing purchasers index here okay sure um it's heavily weighted towards small private firms it fell to fifty from fifty one in August ending Fifteen straight months of expansion\nYeah fifty means that it's effectively ... neutral as far as growth versus expansion\nWhich means they're economies these I don't know if you can call it ... you wouldn't say it's in recession would do you just said slowing\nHeading there you know it certainly is heading there and and and that's you know when when you fall from fifty one to fifty up saying hey we're going from growth to neutral\nThe next step there and you've seen this you know you've seen this now for a couple of months was slowing and these numbers you wouldn't be surprised if you start to see contraction in a couple of areas and there were some a trial balloons floated by the Chinese central bank\nOver the last couple of days saying hey we're ready to step in with monetary policy if need be in order to keep things they'll float here what does that mean\nA unclear at this point are historically when you talk about what it means with regards to China\nIt's a lot more with um the reserve ratios and things along those lines than necessarily changing interest rates just because they are packed to the dollar any any ways\nBut it might just be hey you don't need to keep as much in reserve from may lending perspective you can lend a little bit more in order to encourage a little bit\nMore than one day if China is slowing down wouldn't that logically lead to a decrease in the price of oil because demand for oil would go down in ...\nIn theory yes but I don't think that you have the I I think the mechanics of the oil market are changing and I think that we are entering into a phase where over the next five to ten years\nThe world is going to go from being unit polar as it's been for the last twenty five years since the Berlin Wall fell and I think you are moving into a multi polar a set up where it's not necessarily black and white like it's been for the last twenty five years\nYou're going to see two separate but you are seeing two separate blocks developing between the U.S and China and come in countries that fall in line behind them\nBut the those countries whether they're behind China or whether the behind the United states are still consuming oil\nExcept what currency is purchased it does make a difference you know if\nIf you see and I and I think you are going to see a shift where countries that do not have their long term strategic interests linked with the U.S are going to move more towards the Chinese side of things and I think that that is going to have a very real and very meaningful effect on the dollar over the next five to ten years what\nAre your thoughts on oil do you
