Bamako when again and I'd take maybe two twenty this week\nI uh I was gonna say I saw that which is not betting but that the person who use the numbers from that and\nWe said this ... cookie and won the lottery on it yeah\nGot it from the fortune cookie is I mean it which is good at places anywhere place to get a a set of numbers to win the lottery and get your chances are as good using your lottery numbers as your birthdays or anything else lightning\nSaw this I thought it relevant story in a way but this is where my life is where that guy got the fortune cookie with the numbers are won the lottery I got the bags that which field in puffed but there was no fortune cookie unit\nThat was great what it's like a pillow but there's nothing in the ... can I tell you how many times did you have a cookie\nSaid there was no you're getting the past year that I ...\nIt was like it was stuffing in the Amazon package you know like\nWhat is the best I have had times when I've just like oh I'm going to need this for ten today and I've been going there is nothing in there really caught but when you get the ... and it's like your fortune is then and now they're fortune\nAt that aggravates me I should say Jimmy of anything that they\nAre just that uh Amazon has come out with an announcement today they have announced that starting November first of all of their employees fulltime part-time and seasonal employees will be making a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour in all locations [noise]\nLet's see I guess good right I don't know it's good certainly for people who work at Amazon\nYeah well I mean the knock has been you know Jeff Bezos has the super liberal and he doesn't practice what he preaches services him saying All right I'm putting my money where our mouth is there you go Fifteen dollars for all my employees ... find a way where what's happened in the Amazon and location ... seven and I just [noise]\nSo it just did he just decide ah forget it\nFor what's going on they feel like it but they don't feel like it yet so that that got a lot of popping up again I'm sure at some point does it say sixty days from now we're gonna oh my God we're all going to go crazy and will do it again\nI don't think we just tried to tax you like the tiniest bit and you were going to run in from the state and I kind of ... but you know private business they can do that and I say more power to him good for them\nHow 'bout you Marie to anything today\nYeah so what every month I Do that calculation about that well he talked about and what the biggest headlines were so busy month of September is you can imagine and probably remember\nWe really didn't talk about Trump or a whole lot of course we talked about people close to Trump of course but uh I can you guess how much we actually talked about how much Trump was in the news and\nI Would have said well over sixty percent of our um our normal have already 'cause it seems like we are talking about um all day every day\nYeah it's very shocking a twenty two percent we talked about him as a show ... yeah I mean well\nThe argument too though is that we talked about people around him right low right to him directly taught about how you know I mean we will bring him up we'll talk about his viewpoint ... perspective every once in a while when he chimes then it has it been all him all the time what\nWhat we're ... this is how the world is I Can't even tell you what the subject matter in Washington would have been in the month of September because every day is just another huge story now I Know we talked about Kavanaugh for the last we can have ... ... what what would have been or\nAre only there were someone who would know what else we would well often\n[laughter] so the first week in September and that was the week up Labor Day so that was when the big New York times op ed article came out and that was a big Trump week that we we did talk about you know that river that since September\n... series is that is how the world is here you don't even remember and I thought the world is going to come to an end because of that [noise] yup that happened then the bought by was Woodward's book came out that week as well so that was a big Trump week but then after that we just started\nHurricane Florence do local Miramax valley gas explosions arena Williams and her comment and then the whole Brett Kavanaugh hearing and that took off for the rest of the month [noise] so yeah and then of course Rosenstein so people around Trump but not him specifically a little that of course yeah\nWow that's unbelievable hate us so a story that we didn't talk about on the air today um and I I don't know the whole story but I Know a bit about it but I think you have you read it a little more closely but I just want to talk about this real quickly so the guy [laughter]\nYou got two guys who are CEOs in this country who have just done crazy stuff and our ceiling mosque\nWho so so now he's paid the fine right to the SEC he said he wants to\nKeep it short but he's got to step away for a certain amount of time correcting my understanding is then he's going to step back in maybe it could be three years I mean I was going to work for exactly how is that that's my point how is that\nGoing to work although stock is a little you know it's crazy and then the other one is papa John's [noise]\nFather John is interesting only amid he's decided he wants to back yeah somebody not doing well he knows he thinks he's getting ready to fix it and whatever\nBut about ... anyone would go you're like is it not enough that they have you with the N. word and whether that was in contact with out of context or whether there's even any contracts that that's not enough you could\nDo you honestly think you're just gonna walk right back in their horses comes up right I mean right hey before you do anything quick question you have any NBA's out they oh yeah you have to write let's let's do that to our so I mean have you seen their new ad campaigns there's no way they're new ad campaign is literally people from all of their locations around the country saying we're not him\n[laughter] ... that aren't really what it over and we're not like legit they're like you've only heard one voice where papa John's for very long time but no there's a lot of our voices in where we were not what did you hear what the\nProblem is his argument is yeah you heard one voice and it worked for a really long time do you did something stupid so the problem for him argument for and against him\nIs that your voice was the only one that was working and do it nobody wants to hear your voice now so now it just isn't going to work so you need to go away because if you think that because you were running the company you can do it again you can't because you cannot come back and\nBe papa John's you can't it's done it's over so going\nTo end the argument would be the one decision he made that made the company what it is was partnering with the NFL and he believed that went up himself athlete\nAnything that he did they can't do it again so for him to try to fight to try to get back in that [noise] oh gosh\nWhat if your them ... will be company we can't seem to make it work without um [noise]\nI think the guidelines on born in the company's going to go away or they're going to figure it out\nI'm thinking you sell it wants that brand can you sell it and it just it just sort of rolls into something our nickel\nOn the dollar I'd make Peyton Manning the c._e._o. and\nThat is true [noise] have a great day everybody will be back tomorrow morning six AM\nBoy so Boston New York about one other point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\nYou're spending every nickel or that\nI think I've written and now it's just that said a hundred and three percent of that money goes back to the economy [laughter] meaning all of the race is spent on on let's be honest and medications essential struck a you know but if it's discretionary money it's like you know an extra dinner out an extra couple of lunches of\nGoing through the coals picking up a couple of extra outfits are every penny that goes back into the economy which again has a virtuous cycle of helping everybody so good news yeah we we would I be questioned the motives perhaps behind this because there's a lot of political pressure now\nComing down against these major technology companies well let's let's be honest though John different reasons obviously\nI mean Bezos did this bullied me this had nothing to do with politics this had to do with he's looking at\nJust the ... Christmas season remember last year was no date to be true you had problems they're going to sell thirty to forty percent more stuff this Christmas and they did last course yes yup they need workers yeah this this\nWorkers for the first time John since Nineteen Ninety nine have the upper hand absolute was the last time workers a guy you remember what the job market was like Ninety nine that was like you you would\nThe gift signing bonuses in order to hire a section of the downside of this as we do see it reflected in the quality of help that some a lower paying businesses are having to get\nMy indicator has always been and this has been true for thirty forty years in every single time it's worth\nThe quality of the help I get going through the drive through at McDonalds tells me everything I Need to know about the economy John maybe you should be the McDonald's drive through a little while [laughter] perhaps but I have found that in boom times you wait forever they get the order wrong yup\nRight but I'll tell you something in two thousand nine I got better treatment that a five star restaurant and you know again I don't mean to make a judgment on that it's just a really interesting anecdotal indicator\nIt sure is [laughter] were you were you caught by surprise but the GE announcement yeah that was a surprise I was glad it happened I did it you know I hate to speak ill of the departed but a John flattery sucked\nHe and he just ... and you know why he got fired was for my criticism of the reasons I my criticism of land or he was\nIn February or march whenever it was he came out and said well I didn't understand that we owed all this money for a long term care insurance policies that we sold back in the nineties and we have the right down another twenty billion or something right was furious rose I bought the stock in November and I thought OK I'll bite in November\nGot a new CEO the stock went ... you know Sunni came in and went from like thirty bucks down to Seventeen I said that's got to be the bottom\nRight it's like catching a sort of feel like somebody dropped the sword from the Empire State building and I tried to catch the damn thing well that's the same ... you didn't you didn't buy trucks theory in my theory that whether a cock roaches there were more cockroach I did not you did [laughter] I tested the c._e._o. CEO remember\nIt up and this is why I wanted ... fired back in February I said\nHey he told us that everything he see in every city Odessa is right as soon as you get in office you blame everything predecessor and and you flush all the bad news he did that in November and then he goes oh well I made a mistake and then last week he goes to the board and says\nWell you know I forgot about the power division and hail another twenty three billion there the board said screw it the ... the board was furious\nI think you're right I mean the bottom line is that if we can defend ... the argument here is that he was too deliberative\nThat's a a a generous way of describing what you've just described and so he was deliberative he's been slow and executing the plan now he's been slow into vested in some of the industries and businesses that they want to get out of\nThe restructuring is behind plans now the argument of in his defense is that he's talking about literally restructuring an entire large company and he wants to be carefully gets it right and he wants to ... and he's a deliberative guy by nature\nThe board feels like they need someone to step in take charge and the stuff that he wanted to do we need to do yesterday no so the argument for GE is whatever their plan is it's rolling into high gear ASAP and if you look at the track record of Larry cult yeah let's talk about ... comes over\nEat the he actually took a seat on the board of directors in April maybe listening earlier this year okay even his record it didn't hurt is amazing is it a he was fourteen years CEO I went to the stock chart bury it was literally a straight line up with no tips for fourteen straight years\nUh he increased the value of that company from\nNine point seven billion when he took over to fifty billion dollars when he left and fourteen years\nUh he's run one of the largest science and technology conglomerates in the world and he did an unbelievable job I the first wife left in her that's exactly my point is this guy is only like in his mid fifties I live yeah fifty five years old and he has a track record that would make any CEO jealous\nOr why he was immediately available and why he was still a dancer hers is listed on board that's the only thing he can attributed to ready done it in there done that you know and he sees this as an opportunity to do something really big I mean this was a great historic American name and General Electric my only criticism is is that he teaches at Harvard\n[laughter] you on hold that gets that I bet he doesn't teach there anymore [laughter] but Larry ... yeah no I think he's he's got a real job now or any has an unbelievable track record and investors are definitely viewing this favorably well so\nLet's talk about that are BC raise their price targets fifty but to ... over a J. P. Morgan still has a ten wow yeah I mean or maybe there's more cockroaches fly into soccer\nI actually own some ya I sold mine yeah well you did not good it's a bit the bullet and I I was so furious that flattery I just I sold\n[noise] you know this is one of those value traps that I I criticize myself or buying it because it it it was cheap but I I really penalize and I I could have set up\nAt you like the guy coming in so maybe it'll work out for you I I yeah hopefully it will work out and and hopefully for Boston that works out because Boston [laughter] finally Baker [laughter] given the bridge they gave me the keys to the city\nI heard Shirley talk of all you know they still live a lot of important green businesses and you know it's like okay I forget the PC stuff these guys have got some issues yes ah Larry ... we wish you well for many reasons yes especially if it does [laughter] and I sent me the name pope to other\nLike I'll look it by in the stock but I Know you see what he's going to do is within the next Ninety Days he's probably going to cut the dividend you up and he's going to say all my predecessor sucked and I got a write off all this you know the fifty billion or whatever it is saying like it just ... that that's coming you you have to wait for that announced it's the kitchen sink you expected under\nFlattering that's where he got fired at the annual kitchen sink a General Electric right you you got to do it yeah it ... ... hopefully the Copa smart enough to get all the bad stuff that they're talking about raising equity\nYeah someone more shares unethical dime unbelievable yeah so again the Larry help on the job great history ring record and one thing we know is we will see stuff hitting the fan real quick [laughter]\nBecause he's committed to not being as let's say deliberative Johnson winter he was well we'll see\nComing up we'll be talking about the Internal Revenue service nobody's getting audited lots of people are cheating on their taxes should the IRS the auditing more American taxpayers that's our next topic on the financial exchange\nWe want to hear from you\nSex gay were buried to six three five six six and let us know what do you think of other stories we discuss your tuned to the financial exchange radio network\nDo have a trust to protect your assets if not in your closing in on retirement messages for you planning for retirement can be complicated so it's best to be with an expert who can advise you on the many elements that will affect the process including how to keep your assets at a probate and protect them from the nursing home\n... ... is a partner with the law firm of ... and an expert in elder law is new guy to this month will help you understand how to design the perfect ... will trust and will include the exact language that you need to protect your assets from probate in the nursing home\nThis guy has yours by calling eight six six eight for a five six nine nine sometimes radio show illegal exchange we always discuss issues that can affect you in later life if you're retired or beginning to start or retirement planning\nAnd you have questions about your existing trust or need to know what kind of trust is right for you call eight six six eight for a five six nine nine right now and ask for Todd's brand new guide to design a perfect income only a rebel trust but eight six six eight for a five six nine nine or download the guide right now from our website legal exchange showed dot com\nAnd one hopes that hung up the talk show isn't as easy as it is just ridiculous Gemini buttons yeah this is ridiculous place\n... foster talks to the pro W.

the mark up on the clothes they have those stores to operate right right so they just send me close so they I I spent two three hundred bucks on the clothes every two months [noise] and\nWhat does it cost them twenty bucks maybe ... ... in terms of actually the cost of the clothing their technology they've technology costs and things like that\nThe ... the mark up like if you look at a pair of sneakers might cost new balance a dollar twenty to make those sneakers when they sold us for Seventy five bucks yeah yeah same thing with close right blue jeans shirts\nThe markup that shirt you're wearing now is probably like a what a sixty Seventy dollars ... you're probably cost like a dollar twenty to make okay but I get that but stitch fixes to I'm a middle man so to speak\nAnd they can't get the shirt for a dollar for they they don't pay much for them are just really yeah you work it out of algae either look at their balance ... there were they're spending their money is on climate

triglycerides last week and say we're going to look at a company the stock of the company that actually makes that product Joe McCann from seeking alpha joined us Joe thanks for joining us this morning\nOn again\nYet John tell us about the company and this fish oil capsule what it's all about\nAnd rent the company that has one drug crew coke and the type of purified fish oil type of drug on the market uh two thousand\nTwelve and really there was a big debate around whether or not it actually help people live longer than a heart attack within like a great so we knew that it lowered triglycerides that patients particularly people who had a very high and whether that mattered in your life than it was really worth the time and money to do it was something that was up until recently\nThat's interesting I I've dealt with high triglycerides myself and I know people who also deal with it and I was under the presumption that triglycerides were even a bigger problem than cholesterol but you're saying that that was not a Scientifically Proven\nHad rabbits and so you know a lot of these drugs and the ... an intervention and think about\nYou know hey it probably the problem it looks like we have no animal model like that but until you do with this company which you know any thousand person study over it took seven years to get an act but over a long period of time and actually measured the number of heart attack the number of a number of\nIssues along those lines go into the hospital you don't know for sure well it could be that you know the ... the cholesterol not really that bad and so this is the study that really took a very hard look at it with real and when people care about obviously going to the hospital are back ...\nWe're in stock as reported took off it tripled in a very short period of time but this is not exactly a diversified company hammer and this is the Raleigh product right\n[noise] if they're only product and they think that was holding back for a long time I mean to give you a little bit of the legacy your fish oil a lot of people debated how innovative it was the number to spend a lotta years getting bound you around this product and we don't need to get into all that but they did it and then there's this\nThis trial hanging over head where you know what if it didn't work with anyone get treated for it so maybe the drug doesn't go away but becomes extremely mentioned small and you know rather than having to control you'd markets open to them now it could have been off the coast\nSo we've learned that triglycerides are in fact a potential real problem for people in terms of cardiovascular risk and we've learned that fish oil can help that situation rights to kind of a two prong thing that we've come across the border um\nYeah and I'm a second ... you're one of the reasons people were very skeptical that other show to bail out the Miller type of thing at all people have their doubts argument has always been and this goes back to the the argument in a lot of the\nRationale the drug that it was purified form a certain type called ETA and that that is really concentrated in the patrol you're taking and it's really pure than it had a different impact on on survival and and\nBenefit patients but this was really tough thing that I thought this is the one right type of intervention that work not just you know when you go to the up and get or you know even this other ... that was recently generic so this trip getting it really surprised I think a lot of people on the part of why you

[noise]\n\nGood morning I'm Nicole VW our cable news agriculture experts are praising President Trump's newly reworked North American trade agreement at the world dairy expo in Madison, Wisconsin California dairy farmers Steve says it's a big deal\nThe government basically said look we'll let you off the hook up if you just do this to slap on the wrist and he turned it down and I thought to myself that's crazy then I thought to myself and I want to ask you this question\nI think he lawn mosque realizes that we need the lawn mosque more than he needs us if you're the U.S government\nYou can piggyback your space program right on the back of a guy named yuan mosque you don't need to be spending a couple trillion dollars in space exploration you could say you on\nCan we go on for the ride right okay do we want you on mosques to seek asylum in China right right that would not run South Africa wouldn't that be a massive lawsuit for us yeah right I think you long for the government financed Tesla\nRight there the ... that's where they got there are five hundred million if we lost space sex slow you don't want to lose ... national security right I think he's I I actually get the guy credit I think he realizes\nThe government needs him more than he needs the government and oh by the way you know one of the government do\nSo the stock but slaughtered and mosque like well it's too bad government came back and said you know what we can make this work [laughter]\nI Know you said no but let's kind of get let's let's make this work I think we need them more than me needs us it's an interesting theory they ah\nTen things to know about the NAFTA deal going to tell you the a lot of a noise is being made over this deal and then I looked at the damn thing about much different\nI said it does say nothing\nLike it we went from having access to two point eight five percent of Canada's dairy market up to three point one five or something like ... we still don't have access to the dairy market\nUm and they're actually kind of mad the vet to give up like zero point five oh yeah we're giving into trouble like watch the uh the one thing that that's actually\nPretty good in there I think is especially from a national security standpoint is our cars now have to have Seventy five percent of their parts made in North America\nAnd that's going to be phased in over five years but I Do like the idea is there are certain things that I think we ... there's too many places where we've\nUm extended and an off shored on reduction that are dangerous I'll give an example um your your kids ever have strep throat when they're oh yeah you know all that stuff comes from China\nReally know what I did not know that yeah so imagine you know like you were to trade war with China you're right\nYou do we really want to get into like we we don't make any of that stuff for rabies and incorrect so yeah that's that's a whole separate issue and it's very important Seventy I you know you talked about the fact Seventy five percent of auto components must be built in North America\nRight now the requirement is sixty two and a half percent right so that's uh that I looked at as being pretty significant I Would say the President Trump okay that's a that's a when I put that in the when called it's incremental and it's really it's incremental even that it's phased in over five years\nDoes it also tell you how big a business dairy is though that there was this much squabbling about that yeah and both sides are saying wow this is a really big deal\nApparently Barry is a pretty big business yeah well of course we ain't about everyday right use it every day yeah cheese dream yeah exactly you know I mean dairy is a big deal\nUm and we made some progress in that so that's good I thought another issue that kind of I didn't think was that big a deal but apparently is that forty five percent of workers must make sixteen dollars an hour or more that struck me as a very honor is pay but it's a big deal in Mexico true that's that's where in John ...\nThe Mexican workers in it you know\nLike maybe Canada in the U.S everybody's making over sixty right but in Mexico everybody's making five true and I wonder if that does something to well basically the civil war than going on in Mexico to me in Mexico you talking about a violent play like don't go there on vacation yeah you just don't [laughter]\nBut I also wonder if in Mexico would be that affected by it because if we\nCount all the workers in Canada and we can count all the workers in the United states and then we add they have huge factories in next true\nAnd also this yeah at the at the margin this could keep a lot of jobs from going down there in the future I think that's the big concern yeah I think from Mexico's perspective they they they're they're looking at it and say that the one thing that I'll mention though\n... average price of a new car over thirty six thousand bucks now yeah and that brings us back to ... this is the NAFTA deal that we negotiated is going to make cars it won't be long before the average price of the new vehicles forty forty five thousand bucks and no one's going to buy him that well they're not buying them now I Know like if you look now\nEvery every like my next car is going to be used vehicle yeah I'm just not going to spend that kind of do on a new car well that's spread between the new car and the high quality used cars\nIs now a very very substantial spread and it's it's moved a lot of people to the used car market particularly with some of these really high quality leases were low mileage and and and low\nMiles next topic that we're going to talk about is is um China and how they systematically pride technology from U.S companies I saw this story\nI guess it was last week I saw it but we're going to be joined by Bob Davis\nAnd Bob's going to explain to us what China what kind of pressure China exerts on American companies that
