I'm very brief\nWindow where we really like you and then we slim that windows shut so hard yeah it's really went out and never really come I haven't seen the new show anybody watch that one was that one is that a movie or you know the show\nOh yeah I I Know what you're talking about the west during the name of it is good I haven't watched\nIron wine and believe it was or on Amazon or something something\nIt's going to want to show no it's on ... oh okay I haven't seen it I just you know the only reason I Know it was because we watch our rescue and they put Fifteen promos ... in it for a cause for rescue is the only show anyone watches on paradise ...\nCosts are likes westerns stuff doesn't ever done really well I guess to still needed a\nCop so he did that did that and he did that movie did well so it was something he did that wasn't a what I like Costner\nI Do I mean his comeback was Hatfield McCoys and sort of ran with that yeah\nYeah [noise] I I look\nI got nothing against them I remember going to be the last thing will say about him they promise to take me if he took on the persona of the role that he played in bodyguard which way to launder school\nAnd he kind of took that on in Israel ... and that's where things went south with me [laughter]\nSo I was a little bit strange [noise] the last word\nI'll go right back food we've been talking about this law fair but I'm going to talk about it on our you know I'm as as fast food guys go I'm a Wendy's guy a when whatever ... whenever possible I'm going to get well that's what it's like give me an excuse [noise]\nOh I that that's going to be a long drive I feel like a baby in order and I'm going to do it by today most likely that I my wife doesn't notice yet so she's listen I'm\nA I'm In I'm In there and a while but I'm going to Burger King\n[noise]\nI just told you I got the vampire Iago this week right I Will do any of that you do any sort of\nAnything Halloween related you give me the Frankenstein fake I'll go get it you tell me where it is I'm going to get it and you give me the wolf man\nDip happy to have it I'll Try it and Burger King as the nightmare king right now\nThat's pretty cool looking the nightmare king is basically a bacon cheeseburger yes it's got a couple of things on there all tell them to hold the onions obviously or I'll just pick 'em off but you got a problem do this and there's some green related to the head this song you're gay if I Want to you want to get\nMe you'll get me later because the whole point of the nightmare king burger is that it has a green bond and it has a\nAt least by the pictures it is a dark green Frankenstein face kinda green vibe on and I'm yep yep yep the best\nPart about this is the ... which I just actually talk about this yesterday and forgot so they did this big interview with the they Burger King took this burger and set it to a bunch of people but they fed it to him after seven PM and all of these people swore that they had planned believable nightmares as a result of eating meat\nNightmare burger so they were they all wanted to know you know what did you put in this what did you put in this I one woman told the story about how she Trump that that the burger came to life and it you know blah blah blah and they all these people had this not having been prompt they just came up with that they all had a nightmare so\nThis is why it's supposed to be very unique so I I Hope you'll eat it a little later in the day my response to this would be anybody who he could burger that big after seven PM is going to have nightmares\nBut I Wonder if you you know if you're yeah heartburn dry you say you're kind of in and out of consciousness and you don't really [laughter] not a nightmare you're having [noise]\nSo I make just to see if you have that and if you are the\nBiggest crock of crap story but I I don't even care normally that made me run from something like you're so ... that I'm not interested but it doesn't matter because it's called the nightmare king and I know\nThat did that that was their story I'll tell you whether I ordered the allure of having it is you'll have nightmares in that ...\nFor me I'm not a big nightmare guy anyway but you\nKnow I'm exhausted and I'm Out I'll let you know if I Do if I have it than I was like if I don't tweet a picture of me with that burger today you know my wife decided to fight that long you want and you know we'll see cause I Need to do that with my daughter she's going to love this thing and I the only question whether ...\nHow'd you do got to think I Do I was looking at a story behind you on Fox News said Marsha Blackburn would be the first woman to ever be a senator from Tennessee and it made me curious you know what states have never elected a woman to Congress curious I looked it up there a sixteen states left that have never had a female senator\nThere are poor left but I've never had a female Congress a house of representatives person and there's only one state in the country that has never sent a woman in a new shape or form to Congress and that it and you would never believe which wanted us\nVermont yeah good call\nWow yeah it was down to Delaware Mississippi in Vermont and Delaware Mississippi just elected women so Vermont the last one has never had a woman in Congress in either house while and it's very spry user friendly dog even it's also the state that could potentially be first where they transgender governor and they had\nA woman in my home and they've never sent to Washington wow that's a that's a really interesting little weird like by like the civil unions but and they were like the kind of a gay marriage they're\nThey're just they're collected Jim Wright it's bats no political statement it just one of those\n... ... it also probably have something to do with the fact that both of their senators or a hundred and fifty dated All right\n[noise] um my last word here real quickly is have you guys scene and maybe you you didn't see it and that's too bad 'cause you've missed it clean acts which of course is made by Kimberly Clark well they've had a complaints of sexism [laughter]\nLeveled at them because they had\nA tissue called the man's size to issue so it's a ... that is almost twice the size of their regular size to issue that you have in your bathroom all the time and people complain because they thought that was so sexist and\nBecause they called it the man's size box so now they are getting rid of that they're now going to call it ... extra large [noise]\nThat's where we are in this\nAnd they have found out that the shaving cream for women like really\nYeah what would it would it be different right like anytime the products like that what what is a ... is the females science Kleenex not\nI Am I going out as being small I Can't seem to blow my nose in this thing it's ...\nOr when a woman has a cold and does she still what just some little teeny ... God tissue I Wonder if she wants the man's side I think\nThere needs to be that day I don't again I I Know people get worked up about it I don't mind them making that shift I Would like something more clever than just XL yeah but that is what they're going to call it ... because they don't want to hear it one of you know when they go to ... do bad like that'll be of\nA guy so keep your eye out folks if you get a big old cold and you're female is he acts out something they\nAlready have anything real quick yeah there is some movie trailers and all that fun stuff up on our Web diet of releases that come out today like Halloween and then also the old man and the gun with Robert Redford that's another one is last acting yeah mhm mhm\nIt's out today and this weekend so does that that as well as making a murderer to without on Netflix that's been the big in needed ones are and yet ... about online\nWell we got to leave it right there for the week and we hope everybody has a great weekend remembered the debate coming up tonight between um Senator Warren and Jeff deal and then the second one on Sunday and then of course we'll all rally back next week for the beginning of the world series on Tuesday I have a great weekend everybody\nOh boy so Boston New York or Boston one hundred and twenty seven till you see a like a fee to Boston and I are radio station\nYou know do we go look at it a bigger one now do we look at improving our current home or do we look at buying a new home but our interest rates three point eight Seventy five percent it's tough to let go of that you\nGo get one now you're looking at five so I mean I don't I don't know how I justify that and now in all likelihood I don't see a situation where I Am very likely to look at a new home anytime says\nInstead of this is the situation that I think the fed finds itself in as you're seeing signs of the housing market is slowing in in the housing market is a major engine for growth both in terms of what people are able to borrow\nIn order to hate generate spending that way but also the the economic activity crates as far as jobs for plumbers carpenters electric under age ... you name it you run down the list and so I think the fed is between a rock and a hard place because there is inflation coming because\nThe labor market is so tight right now and that's not going away anytime soon I don't think\nAt the same time you have a slowing economy as as these numbers indicate on this that I think is going to become an issue at some point next year the fed can't have both they can't say hey we're going to chop inflation and we're going to have a strong housing market you can't have both at this point I think that's what this data is telling me\nThey're going to have to pick what is more important to them keeping inflation in check or keeping the economy moving in the if you go back to the Paul Volcker days Paul Volcker raised rates through the roof because he said it's more important to keep inflation in check and keep the dollar strong\nThey keep the economy moving in the short term\nI don't know where Jay Powell is going to land on yeah but he's going to face it it's not going to be the magnitude of what Volcker faced but it's a similar decision\nAnd historical precedent says that Volcker was the outlier because every other time we've seen this most of the fed chair is typically say yeah let's keep things moving and try to keep the economy ... and that's what we've typically seen so that's where I come up with my thought hey we're probably seen one hike next year knock the three they're guiding towards\nThis data point is kind of the first one that really suggest hey there's there's really something that's going on here that the feds gonna have to\nPay attention to the data point that I think could easily offset this if you said okay we do have a declining housing market but we got some retail sales at the end of this year that just knocked the roof off that could that could change things for the fact that can really push them towards raising interest rates again in that two to three hikes next year rather than just one\nTo talk about what's going on in China they reported their second quarter or a third quarter GDP I'm Sorry a and it came in at six point five percent year over year which begs the question what the heck is the real GDP their cars six point five certainly isn't what's actually going on\nYeah I always tend to discount whenever whenever the Chinese government puts out bad economic data you always got discounted a little bit\nBut six point five percent for China's not very good anyway that's the worst GDP Growth number that they've seen since the first quarter of two thousand nine and a anyone falling at home you remember what the economy was like back in first quarter of two thousand and not\n[noise] yeah wasn't particularly strong no wasn't particularly good so ... ... ... again it raises the question hey if if they're telling you it's six point five percent and slowing\nHow slow is it actually is a three and a half to four and a half I have no idea but we know from you know just kind of what we've seen in\nDivergence is before numbers between what China tells you and then what their electricity consumption isn't their gas consumption we know it's not usually what they're telling you right it's just a question of how far off it is\nUm but either way you look at this China is going through a period of slowing and I think you can draw a pretty direct line there between what we're seeing from a trade perspective and the slowing growth that's going on\nYeah I mean if you want to take the pessimistic view sure you can say the second largest world economy is slowing down but if you're an American you want to be optimistic view it appears that you know our trade tariffs are having a good impact it appears that we are intentionally trying to and succeeding and slowing down the Chinese economy\nSo this is going to be something that does bear watching you know we're ... it's gonna be interesting to see if this continues into the fourth quarter there but trying to coming in again with its slowest GDP Growth number since two thousand nine\nObviously an economy like that can't grow Seventy percent a year forever but still it's just that things are not\nUh not all rosy in China at the moment chair ... let's talk tipping because this is a it is is just a phenomenal topic to get into so ... you to have been into you've gone into whether it's you know bakeries coffee shops\nWherever it may be that there's a lot of these new pointed fail terminals maybe they're run by square pay ... a ... there's a whole bunch of matter there where it's pretty much an eye pad and then the cashier enters in what you're going to pay and then they flip it over to sneak into signing your car sign your name and swipe and everything but when they flip it over and show it to you\nEven though you're just maybe picking up a coffee or maybe they're still a spot none of spot but the first prompted hey how much tip do you want to give life in a lot of people are finding themselves in the awkward situation of saying\nWell gee I'd I don't want to tip you anything just 'cause all you're doing is handing me something across the counter why am I tipping you for that what's what's going on here\nYeah or maybe in some circumstances you pay three fifty for something and you know leave the back in the day you and say okay you're the fifty cents and cherish I'll put that in the tip jar right\nOn these are prompting much larger tests you know the general what you're seeing out there is if you're purchasing an item for less than ten dollars the options are one two or three dollars and if it's over ten that I think it's Fifteen\nNo Eighteen twenty or twenty five per cent tip levels as the default\nNow that the ... can be changed by the individual uh owner okay so they say okay we want to change the default there but a lot of them aren't necessarily doing that and so\nI guess both are individuals who are buying stuff as well as cashiers are saying man this is really awkward you know cashier flip it over and you know you bought it for you know two dollar muffin or something like that and it's asking you if you want to give a two dollar tip right and you're sitting there and like\nLook I really liked the cashier man but I'm not tipping you a hundred percent on that it's\nNot like it's good but it's not that good and you're nice but you're not that nice and by the way it will smelly so hey let's let's get this cleaned up around here a vote that OK well here's a practical example\nThat I'm gonna throw out that has driven me crazy there is a brewery that shall remain nameless that I that I frequent than go pick up\n... you know I I'll go buy a bunch of cans there because they don't sell them and liquor stores and to you know you have to go to the brewery to get them\nGo in there you might buy ... there have been occasions where I bought two hundred dollars worth of cans of beer and then you go to sign it and there's a you know default twenty per cent tip level for them to be who just carried a case of beer over the counter and gave it to me ... I've never tip the guy the liquor store\nOr but I just don't understand why this prompted coming off a yeah it's bothering me a little\nBut I'm going to go on a little different direction or while I Do think that there is added pressure when they do flip that I've had over to you\nYou can just as easily just said no tip and I don't have any problem that I frequently do that I'm not a big a temper when I'm going to a coffee shop or anything to big tip that idea of is when I go out to eat and sit down and have a meal that's what I really give a good tip\n'em I feel more awkward when I put my leftover change in the jar 'cause I'm really oh yeah I feel way more awkward doing that because of\nWho the hell wants to count all the change at the end of the day at the end of your shift and got rolled nine to me that ... yeah exactly but I feel awkward making them do that to add a task\nYou know to make more work for them just to count their tip money and I just feel more awkward putting change in the jar as opposed to a dollar would say\nThis does take us over to our poll question of the day up on right now on financial exchange show dot com they feel more pressure to tip on I pat cash registers again had over the financial exchange show dot com and vote\nYou can also Texas at six three five six six if you want to give us your opinion on whether or not you'll like these uh you know the new cash registers that are based on I ... that you know they're just flip it over and say how much do you want to tip\nWhat does know what your thoughts are on that and whether or not you liked him hate him or hate just doesn't move the needle much for him [laughter] we're going to take a break when we come back we're going to talk more about the story a involving the missing Washington Post journalist who is suspected to have been killed\nA and exactly what the Trump Administration is doing in response right after this break down the financial exchange\nYour hopes for breaking financial news usa financial exchange with very Armstrong and chunks out a form of financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique\nProducts and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and digitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

for anyone not familiar it is a you know in allegedly secure system for you to transfer money from one person's bank to another\nRather than having to get that person's bank account number and you know full set of information you use this application as long as they're also signed up for it you just need to search for um\nUh you see there you know their profile picture a lot you know when you log in there and you can just seamlessly transfer them funds for free yeah there's no charge to transferring money between one individual to another individual to the\nBig thing that uh they saw him in ... by the way is owned by pay pal they bought them I think maybe four or five years ago now um so the volume of payment that they process in the third quarter roast Seventy eight percent year over year\nTo Seventeen billion dollar is still a little bit more than ten percent of pay pal hundred and forty three billion total volume for the quarter\nBut the big thing that they're starting to see is that more people are participating not just in the free transfers that you do to get money to a friend but what they call ...\nAnnette ... action twenty four percent of bend mobile users are participating in that type of transaction now that's up from Seventeen percent in the second quarter and only Thirteen percent in May of this year so almost doubling in the span of six months\nYeah

sell you anything on here which is not yet at least nice and refreshing yeah not not yet but where they are monetize ing seems to be on consumer to business and business to business transactions where your linking a credit card to your account\nAnd say you're ordering a meal for delivery and you use your ... to complete that transaction they're keeping a three percent transaction fee on that\nSo they're keeping that above and beyond what the credit card process\nYou've so yeah er which seems like it'd be pretty pretty substantial amounts that you'd be paying you're talking like ... percent total then when you factor in credit card fees so perhaps they have some sort of deal worked out with a credit cards to you know less than that a little bit but a\nPretty substantial uh but you know in the same thing happens with pay pal pay pal I think you pay two point nine percent than those same transaction so um they really where the opportunity lives for them is they're starting to get integrated with you know companies so\nWhen you log into grub hub or eat you can log you're more information right in there and you can just seamlessly you know not not entering a credit card information just boom ... real quick logging to bend mow and complete the transaction\nLet's go back to our poll question of the day since this is somewhat related to this or do you feel more pressure to tip on eye pad cash registers Tucker what kind of results do we have to this\nPoint so far still pretty early here but fifty six point two percent of our listeners say no they do not feel more pressure when tipping on me I had a cash registers and we also have a couple techs coming in or one out of the five oh wait\nA no pressure at all I ... know tip every time with al ... a year where you're not a waiter or waitress you don't serve me you don't get tips and then a out of the nine seven eight hey guys spot on with the tipping I refused to tip for take out\nSo that's the next place that I was going to do you get a tip on taking no\nNever I Do I Do unless it's a large order ... to ...\nAnd I it depends on the type of take out but if I'm buying something where they need to individually package a bunch of stuff that they would otherwise need to just serve on my plate I figure they're putting in at least as much work to some degree as a disturbing it so I tend to tip a few bucks when I'm doing take out if it's something like\nSushi where they've got you know kind of a complicated order to complete and separate if I'm buying a box of pizza that's a different story\nI typically on on takeout I'll still tip ten percent just 'cause a lot of times ah workers do share tips that pool tips a lot of restaurants fail and so on something that's takeout from what would normally be a sit down restaurant mhm I'll still tipped ten percent just because hey I'm I'm not getting the same service that I was outwardly\nIf I were sitting down there but all the back and work is still being done so I Do still tip ten percent on take out orders\n\n[noise] say on top of breaking financial news by becoming a member of berries brigade log onto financial exchange of done gum and sign up today [noise]\nWho are as they prepare for their IPO's now it sounds like it's going to be in the first half of next year they had that lovely a\nArticle in the wall Street Journal about how they're targeting a hundred and twenty billion dollar valuation earlier this week which I think it was just pure messaging under the half of the banks that are working for them if they are now apparently testing a quote on demand a labor service uh in order to provide\nEmployees are temp employees pretty much for whether it's you know one off of events like weddings and things like that maybe it's do you need someone to come in for a couple of weeks to do\nData entry but they're trying to get into this business which leads me to the question why on earth do they think they're going to be good at this I actually am going to disagree with you here I I think that they have\nThe potential to be able to pull this off um you know they're already pretty good at dictating specific terms to a non I go to a contractors um and they've got a pretty big network of people that could potentially bring into this\nUm I think it will be difficult for them to do this in such a tight labor market but I think I think that they could be successful with this the only thing that I think prohibits them from it is that their reputation has taken such a hit over the last few years that people might be has been to sign up for it but you know ... if let's say\nLet's say you live in town and you don't own a car you can't drive for over a but you're looking to pick up a few bucks I could've seen myself in my early twenties then yeah I'll go work a A R do work a wedding at ah this place I've got a you know I've got a suit that I can wear and I'll go show up and go surf people they're not sure\nI guess my question isn't so much whether people would sign up to do the work yeah it's ... what's the incentive for if someone's having a wedding to go look at ... instead of someone who specialize in that exact particular thing that they probably already have relationships with\nI Would hope price that's however succeeded in what they're currently doing\nBut he loses money on that stuff they do yeah so I I just I look at it in in where's the long term value what can they what can they do that someone else can't I don't I just I I don't know if I see this being of real value for them\nI I yeah I think there's potential for them you know given their scale given they're already existing expertise on paying these people on getting them into their network I think they have the potential to really do something here\nAnd if they do I can see them severely under cutting you know the other staffing agencies that currently do this today and yeah you know we always say well no this company's got such expertise in it that you couldn't just step in and do that but you know what there are plenty of companies that Cohen disrupt industries that you might have an area of expertise and it\nIs a good point a story in the wall Street Journal the headline is oil prices fall further on rising us oil supplies OPEC report says\nTo this I say well on those just for just a

from the customers judging you ... you can see what you do know you have to pick everything you you have to pay its a pocket of on Capitol Hill is a cashier put you on the cash you got an ... year okay\nI feel more badly just by the customers and cashier they're going to get over it they'll figure it out yeah customers oh we weren't that no one behind you Chuck well then I don't feel judged okay\nYou know I can deal with cashiers like I can deal with it you know but I was cash you know worked that job I Know how it is so so did you\n... or you know did you like not appreciate customers as much because they weren't tipping\nTipping is what bothered me so much was customers who were actually ruin throughout any process more like typical like you don't know necessarily what a customer's going through they might be going through financial tough times maybe they can't be the same way that they normally would so I don't blame customers you know because you don't know what's going on under the hood there but that's\nDoesn't mean again just 'cause like you can't tip doesn't mean that you can't be nice 'cause it doesn't cost anything to be nice to a cashier cars look it's a tough job sometimes so what what got more under my skin wasn't customers who didn't hit me it was customers who are rude to me for absolutely no reason because look just and you don't have to do that that's something easily within your\nControl a tech set of the five oh wait a I think feeling pressure or over this tipping situation is a little bit odd no one is putting pressure on you so maybe it's just guilt\n[noise] well it could be you know my mother worked hard on guilt maybe it's paying off you know\nLet's talk about doubt dupont they recorded a four point six billion dollar charge or in the agriculture unit what's this related to\nLike you just have seen a pretty big slow down and you know declining valuations of the agricultural sector as a whole largely because of terrorists and so with all the accusations that acquisitions that they have made they've really had to take a good hard look at the value of their agricultural unit and in this case they had to record\nThat yeah you know what what we thought this stuff was worth was actually worth four point six billion dollars less than our initial estimates how much this the biggest trade related\nYou know a good chunk but I don't think you would take a four point six billion dollar charge off if you thought a hundred percent of that was trade related because trade related can be temporary ...\nSo I I think a good portion of this has to be you know ... the goodwill and do other stuff here just isn't worth what it was um\n[noise] but some of it straight to live a good a good chunk of it's got to be but not all of it\n[noise] we haven't talked in a while now about a Amazon H cute too which is\nProbably the single biggest a project that somehow you know taxpayers don't realize they're going to be on the hook for when it's all said and done due to all these tax breaks that Amazon's likely going to get but Amazon apparently is revisiting some cities as they are trying to wrap this decision making process up by the end of the year it was when\nWe first heard about this was it about a year ago now God I don't know it feels like decades ago that we've been talking about this I think it was about a year ago but apparently they are doing bad too so the production wall that we have was dating back to September seven twenty Seventeen just over a year or a year now\nAnd so I guess apparently they've gone back now to New York city to Newark New Jersey to Chicago they've also been following up with a couple of cities like Miami and DC are a couple of cities just haven't heard from them at all and a few months apparently Raleigh North Carolina hasn't heard from them I guess but\nSo the only thing that I think you can derive from the story because we do this every week oh Jeff Bezos responded in Texas do they do choose that says ... tracking yeah I think the ... it's like a A R where's Waldo type of scenario here\nBut I I think the only real thing that I've been able to garner from this is there seems to be a slight\n...\nI don't know preference for a metro city area rather than more of a rural area\nI'm standing by my prediction that this is all miss direction they've already built in Boise Indiana voted no and if you're just going to they're just going to be hate like we've got Amazon Boise open ended no one had any clue was coming in there it's done and it's finished that's that's what I'm sticking\nWith now I think it's going to be a very big city I I Would very much doubt that it shouldn't be New York New York or Chicago I just don't think that those states have their rights tax situation to allow Amazon to be there but I can be wrong will say\nWell let's let's ask a different question we we've asked before you know where do we think Amazon ends up with the second headquarters when do you think they finally make a decision\nI have to hope that they do it by and the year ... ah\nDecember thirtieth December fifteenth\nNovember twenty ninth\nOr if I'm going November twenty ninth they're making a decision tucked you can put those up on the protests and a half to get what why else would I have done that higher there [laughter] there's no point in me do that when I put it on record I was December thirtieth Mike was saying the fifteenth\nAnd shock was actually no I'm I'm ... don't get ... get out I I did a week ... no matter no you can't you know I
