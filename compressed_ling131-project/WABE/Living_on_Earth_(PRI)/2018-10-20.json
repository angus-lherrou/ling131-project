United States\nIt pass through quickly though and dropped less rain than other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria [noise] only the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to a category four and just twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back living on earth Michael\nThank Steve it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and it became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat waves and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming the planet\nNow hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve seed and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into storm surge these days well\nYou know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us\nSea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy twenty twelve at at a sport too\nA Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several billion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added

moment when so many things that we've always believed in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting\nTo feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like crisis like the end of the world as we
