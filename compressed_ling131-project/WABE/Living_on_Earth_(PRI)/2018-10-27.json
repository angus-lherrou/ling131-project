charges thrown out on that\nThink we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling Getty was you know happiness\nWe are not going to jail and quite frankly that I'm off bail and may have the

to testify for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from Nassau\nAnd Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was to sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony

four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you heard a booth charged to let you use the necessity defense\nYes and he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have constrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that\nAnd he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised until that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his\nWas the fact that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has a burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did\nYou know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter\nHow articulate we had been it wouldn't have had anything like
