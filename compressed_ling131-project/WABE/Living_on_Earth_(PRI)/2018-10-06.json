detect pressure changes related to the formation of a tsunami but\nThey haven't been functional in years and the new system to be anchored to the ocean floor and less vulnerable to vandalism was awaiting the green light for deployment when it was rejected for lack of funding just days before the most recent disaster struck\nUniversity of Pittsburgh political science professor Luis comfort worked with teams of researchers in the U.S and Indonesia to develop and under the sensor network to detect so nominees professor comfort joins us now welcome to living on her\nThank you for having me\nSo what are the challenges of Indonesia has faced in preparing for extreme events like Saddam is\nIndonesia is in a very risk prone environment Seventeen thousand islands and counting it has a major earthquake over seven point magnitude on the Richter scale every year at least every year it's vulnerable also to sue nominees and volcanic eruptions\nSo this is a major challenge for the country\nAnd of course I'm a little more than a decade ago there was a huge catastrophic tsunami event there in Indonesia\nYes two thousand for a sit down I mean at the tip of northern Sumatra ... and ... literally one in three people in that city were killed\nI was there two and a half months after the tsunami but seeing the devastation and still it was the stench of dead bodies two and a half months it's just sobering\nAnd it's this kind of experience that has made me so intent on trying to do what is possible to support decision making for the public managers that face these horrifying situations\nSo I understand that the proposal to get the sensors installed in western ... stall in fact just a few days before this latest sue nominee hit a I guess it was due to funding concerns how did you react when you heard the news\nI was proof fondly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nSo there were two parts to this project one is the undersea network that provides the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially\nA cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuate or move to safer ground\nWe had planned to do the deployment this long September October the Indonesian agency being cagey was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one\nUnfortunately that's exactly the case\nAs I understand that there was a system of booties there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia\nSupported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies that were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor change in the water pressure in the water column\nThat those buoys actually had been vandalized\nAnd we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T that managed to movies actually cancelled that program\nTwelve to Thirteen states represented and those are all the states and where's the insect is now in in you know these these coast\nBut Aaron says the tent holds a deeper meaning about invasive insect when we use language\nLike invasive species we are attributing agency to the insect or the plant or the animal vet is invading but in fact it really doesn't have agency the insect came on nursery stock that we imported\nAnd then the insect does any immigrant would do it says I'm here I got to eat I got out of place to live in a place to make a better life for my offspring and so\nFor me it's a good way to talk to people to get them to think about what are we use really thinking about when you\nGo after an invasive species or when you label something invasive species\nAnd says the installations here to get both visitors and scientists thinking about these issues\nBack in two thousand for researchers tried to mimic the way it they'll just kill him locks to see how the ecosystem would respond\nSo we took ... rings around

that got and thinking about the ethics at his work I like to try and use this as a way to talk to my scientific colleagues about how you really have to think about what we are doing to the organisms and we study right\nKill these trees to understand how this forest will respond\nWe learn a lot by doing that we respect what we're doing we published our data that's how it gets out but\nWe do have
