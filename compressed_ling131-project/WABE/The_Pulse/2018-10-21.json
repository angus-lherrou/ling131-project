there are some older women in the climate movement who are engaging in civil disobedience no longer hippies their grandmothers now\nI'm Nancy Feinstein Nancy is a grandmother and helped to found a

congresswoman\nWhen you see people putting their bodies on the line it makes people pay attention for example in the civil rights movement people breaking unjust alliance like sitting at the lunch counters or\nWriting at the front of the bus and seeing African Americans getting beat up by police and police dogs made the public realize this is not fair and it completely changed the American

grandmother an elderly woman who cares about the next seven generations\nAnd is Nancy says grandmothers can't afford to do this\nOlder women can actually step up in ways that maybe when we were first trying to establish ourselves we couldn't do it when we were raising children we couldn't\nOf course the downside is we're old and a little creaky\nAll of us have had conversations about this because many of us had physical disability\nThat has made me more worried when I get the rest of us my mom because she is less you know physically able and she is more stressed out about being in the back of a police lab again or being made to sit in a position that it's painful\nSo I I worry more for her in terms of physical discomfort than myself\nI feel more willing to take some risk um because I Can't think of anything more important [noise]\nYou have to identify with a grandmother [laughter] if the public sees a grand mother getting arrested for a cause that they believe in it makes me think
