{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "\n[noise]\nNot too often you get to sit down and have an early morning cup of coffee with a person who basically created an entire industry but I went out to West Hollywood last week to do exactly that\nRoute Paul is known by a lot of you perhaps as the founder and the force behind ... drag race a drag queen reality competition on VH one but he has been a fixture in the entertainment business for a whole lot longer than that in drag and history close as a musician actor and talk show host he's an author and a TV producer to\nAnyway we met at a restaurant out in West Hollywood early as I said I got there first so I poured\nWhat are you taking your ... ... actually black cream awesome coffee served is listen we shut\nThe breeze for a little while we're both early riser as it turns out and then we got to\nI usually get up is for this morning it was um I woke up but I think\nProbably one forty I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't so are you in the early ... guy or what I was in bed by nine so I got a maybe four hours is that I'm not good with math therefore ours is yeah is that a chronic thing if you're always don't\nAlways have yeah well you know when I was worked when I was in the club world in New York [laughter] I Would go to bed\nAt six in the morning and and probably wake up at noon one o'clock this is ...\nIn ... in elegant way to start this but you're no spring chicken anymore so how do you keep going up the pace you keep going I like colors and beauty and love and music and art I like things that are pretty in the beautiful things keep me going\nAll through the longer up as a long day how I I Love solving problems at work creative problems you know\nAnd it's like how we can do this I think that's fun\nDo you ever look around given you know where you started and and the transformation that you have made in your life did you ever look around and go this is crazy out here\nIt is crazy and during the production meeting yesterday I examined why it felt so weird that these thirty production heads were\nSitting around me doing this thing because of me you know and and I see I'm In it and I thought we knew why do you feel undeserving the wrong word but\nWhy does is still so odd to you and I and I had to still still do you do have a long time yeah it has to do with and the density I created from childhood where my father\nYou know I wasn't a big priority for my father so you know kids create this I created this a density and it's been hard to shake even no everything's proven all that wrong\nAnd it's worked out pretty well yeah yeah when did you know that this was who you were well or are I guess\nYou know it's it's not who I Am it's what I Do for a living [laughter]\nUh yes it\nIs first of all I Love that laugh I'm like oh yeah it's what I Do ... it's my favorite thing by the way to do is to laugh on this planet favorite thing\nUh you know which I knew I was going to be famous I started in theater and rock and roll band and a stumbled into drag and it was like a university that do that and they say okay I don't know how that's going to work but okay\nDid it and I was escorted to the front of the line\nOr or maybe you push your way out of it was a little bit of both you know you have to be I I Am dish is\nDefinitely a questionnaire I Want to ask about and and it revolves around a\nWho you are and what you do but also um you as an entrepreneur mhm um because you are you're an entrepreneur what's your risk tolerance\n[noise] ah it Chris ... how about all or nothing [laughter]\nA\nA risk tolerance because because you made risky choices early underlined or when you decided to to be who you are you off but also you know pitching shows and and drag racing dragged on and all of those entrepreneurial things you've done can rest\nYeah sure everything is is in life is hard and life is hard whether you choose to uh be shot caller or just sit at home and watch daytime television all day and the risk to really have little to do with losing things are losing a lot of money it has to do with\nLosing your ability to get out of bed in the morning and to feel excited about living life\nYou never know with that next big ideas coming from and you have to be really a seeker and uh I've been a seeker from day one I always wanted to know how this worked what's behind all this what's under the hood shall we\nTalk for a second about this book grew a it's it's a collection of um a much smaller essays right yeah um and you're pretty open an ear about some of the challenges and about the intention analogy with which you have gone about drag 'em it's expensive first of all holy cow you must spend a lot of money on is\nReally about the money it's just I I Am the queen of queens and the queen of queens deserves to look at it is this expected to look like a million dollars you know even though it costs a million dollars on a lot more than a million and it got it costs a lot but you know I've been at this for a long time you know yeah\nThere's a there's a page in here where you talked about how you want it to ... yes and a silhouette that was easily done by caricature is yes and photographers you thought this through yeah it was it it's not rocket science\nHi I just I've always been\nLooking for the secret recipe you know and I've always felt like the little boy who felt to earth and I thought\nYou know what I don't fit in to society but I can figure this out so I I paid attention I look and the combination I I used to create this larger than life character that's my public persona fear I use all the things that I Love David Bowie share\nJames Brown Diana Ross Dolly Parton through 'em all in there and and created this iconic look\nIf I say that you created the modern drag industry with direct con and drag race among overstating the case the hell no no\nNo I've earned the right to say I I Am definitely the queen of queens I'm the most famous drag queen in the world and the most famous drag queen ever in the history of humans on this planet\nAnd that if you're on your cell and that is true you know I've read articles where people say I'm regarded as one of the most famous I'm like really be really\nI mean come on and yet or\nYou don't do drag very much anymore\nI Do it if somebody's paying me I'll do it a Judas ... he's ready to throw it out some serious cash I Am a value euro\nBut here we are here in St closure on street clothes or on the show a lot yeah is it just it's not a\n... ... here's the question do not need to do it anymore no I've never needed to do it it's what I Know ... it's what I learned how to do it really well people responded to it but I've said it many times you know said again you're born naked and the rest of the strike we're all in drag and you put on a certain drag\nTo navigate and work a certain system that you you need to make happen here in jak right now\nIn a catches on this or that you're a drag khakis and a sweater sometimes I wear khakis and a sweater and there's a purpose behind it when I Do it\nWhich is what I usually when I'm wearing khakis and a sweater it's like I'm I'm I don't want to be seen or I don't want anybody to see me but that's got to be tougher you're right I mean here you are tall bald black guy with a with a certain bearing yeah yeah right is it tough for me it's a tough I use clothes I use my body\nTo navigate this world I'm surprised that you can buy yourself you have no ... I'm not that bitch you know I you know I get I you know I I work a lot of people I work with some people now they come with twenty people yeah I ... I Want to\nGet the job done get in out and be on my way by ... and I was never that the entourage person never\nI I was going to ask what's next but for you but I I imagine you're going to see what happens\n[laughter] well I like to get through this day first and then um and I got a lot of things on the calendar but I like what I Do I Love the fact that our show as launch the careers of a hundred and forty drag queens who are now making hundreds of thousands of dollars around the world\nWhich gives me this and there's a ... I I think there's some irony to this question but I I don't know why I'm In a lot of ways now you're the man\nYeah sure I'll take that yeah hey\nYou know what things change there's a time when I couldn't get arrested in this town and I and I've forgotten that either but I'm everything cyclical you know everything changes I'm having a great time right now and that's really all that matters honestly [noise]\nPolitics along thank you [noise] that was just a bit of my coffee ... through there is a bunch more from that interview including his thoughts on drag racing what it's like to leave a day as Ron Paul on our corner office ...
