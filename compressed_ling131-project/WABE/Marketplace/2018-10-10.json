couple of dozen volunteers gather at the historic woman's national democratic club in Washington DC they said it along you shaped table and do their part to get out the vote I volunteered\nMore this

better spent elsewhere says Clarissa Martinez she's vice president of need us us a nonprofit that focuses on boosting Latino political engagement\nSo what do you see is that the vast majority of resources actually chases highly have vigil voters first and foremost\nWhen what you really need to do says Martinez is bringing new voters\nFor young voters and for communities like the Latino

[noise]\nThis is going to sound a little cynical and I suppose in a way it is but that doesn't make it not true kids and I'm Talking really young kids who are or a market their market that can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by YouTube book on the program thanks for having show talked about how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old vaccine\nToddler YouTube and I was like what are all these things all these brands I've never heard of these companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nHuh okay there are lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old ... year olds three year old is and that's what I call tons of YouTube and it's this\nKind of wild place well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them all almost as much as adults it kind of seems\nAbsolutely I mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space has called to chew TV they have Nineteen billion view is they have twenty nine million subscribers\nThis is a global children's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back when the the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all of that was to educate not necessarily one or two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that the mission of of toddler YouTube an end to chew TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they bent entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer it's on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that affects their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's going to work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube is doing not really\nOn the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously much different and the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically dishes where kids are going", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "10"}
