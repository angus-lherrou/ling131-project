A. the White House says the agreement is a quote when for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns Loftis ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops you know for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nOn so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already in so taken away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and uh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico hit a selfish to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that\nMaybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year I had that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the tariffs were imposed\nThe movements slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see when I was just plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of look like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses\nUm both hops in Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe Mexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see\n'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a that we've uh pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcomed by most of us and in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah absolutely as labor in our part of the country appear a farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us in many other employers in this region\nA were extensively using the age trade guest worker visa program to help meet our labor needs and there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right now that would\nMake some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nPatrick Smith from leftist ranch is good to have you back on the show great thankfully\nIf you have questions about this revised trade relationship between the U.S Canada and Mexico or many trade
