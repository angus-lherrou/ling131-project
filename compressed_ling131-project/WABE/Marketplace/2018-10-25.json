percent increase primarily due to the uh increase materials cost\nThe company that produces the little water purifying resin balls is called pure light it sells to municipal water systems around the country that serves millions of consumers it is a U.S company but it owns a factory in China Jacob Brody is vice president he says one way to get around the tariffs would be to make the filter resin here\nTo build a new facility in the United states\nWill cost tens of millions of dollars and take two to three years his factory in China search customers all over the world he says building an additional factory just for the U.S\nDoesn't make economic sense we couldn't afford to shut the factory down in China meanwhile he's applied with us trade representative to be excluded from the tariff attorney Richard Weiner is representing ...\nThe problem at all is is there is no timeline for us to you are to decide on our motion for reconsideration\nThe U.S trade representatives offices received around five thousand applications to get exemptions from just a small piece of the China tariffs the Commerce Department has received almost thirty six thousand applications for exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs ambassador Miriam sparrow is a former deputy us trade representative\nThis is such an unprecedented situation as a small agency us simply does not have the resources necessary to try and process the current backlog of requests for exemptions\nIn some ways pure light is lucky because at least it can apply for an exemption most companies don't have that option under administration rules attorney Richard Weiner says he has no idea whether he'll get a response was application in weeks or months or years us yard and respond when asked about this\nIn our case it's really rather urgent goal of the top tariffs it is to punish China but here we have a situation where the effect of the tariff is solita harm Americans not Chinese so we're kind of caught in a crossfire\nWith no clear timetable for getting out in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace\nOn Wall street day basically got back everything they lost yesterday details numbers you know the

will at each case go forward next week those students claimed the government in action on climate change global warming violates their rights\n... has more now on the courts and the climate\nThe suits combat climate change from a variety of different angles New York's suit against Exxon is a straight up corporate fraud case says Michael Burger at the Saban Center for climate change law at Columbia University\nIt's a case that's about a company that told investors one thing but it was in fact doing something else\nExxon calls the allegations baseless at least nine cities and counties have sued fossil fuel companies to help defray the cost of adapting to climate change and then there's the lawsuit filed by Twenty one young Americans that could go to trial next week\nIt alleges that the government should do more to protect Americans from the effects of fossil fuels\nThere's been an up tick in lawsuits like these in part because of improved scientific techniques sets burger\nDemonstrated methodologies through which you can trace global greenhouse gas emissions to the fossil fuel companies\nThere's also been a proliferation of electronic documents that can reveal internal company communications Carol nothing with the center for international environmental law compares it to the internal documents that implicated tobacco companies\nMuch of the focus has been on you know a growing awareness of the difference between what these companies knew and what they told the public what they told investors what they told regulators\nMoffett says these lawsuits are moving faster than the ones that caught up with big tobacco in New York I'm Janet Babin for market [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThere was a report out from American Express earlier this year the credit card people about the state of women owned businesses in this economy that had a whole lot of interesting data points that\nThe one that applies to this next interview is this women are starting on average Eighteen hundred and Twenty one businesses a day in this country and the reason we mentioned that right now is in service of this question where are these women making these kinds of deals and starting and running these new businesses\nOne answer is in co working space it specifically women focused co working space is a company called the wing is one of them\nOr ... is cofounder and ... thank you so give me the uh the virtual radio tour if you would if I Walk into a one of the wing locations in at like four in the afternoon what am I gonna say\nYou're going to see hundreds of went in on their laptops working taking meetings on conference calls having\nCoffee dates starting businesses at pretty extraordinary\nShows so these are not small little space is these are large convening spaces I suppose in a sense right\nThat's correct um our our largest flagship and the so her neighbor had it in our city is going to be twenty thousand square feet\nOh you're almost like a big bucks I mean that's crazy [laughter] we're still we're still we're still small maybe maybe not ... but we have big plans will so let's talk about that a little bit give me first of all the the just the elevator pitch right I mean you've gone out and you've got ... been very successful at getting venture capitalists to invest in you and your vision\nWhat's the what's the what's the elevator pitch\nSure I mean the ... was inspired by history really um and then at the turn of the twentieth century and the sort of late Nineteen century there were hundreds of\nWomen's clubs and so they were a huge part of the suffrage movement in the overall advancement of women in this country but they kind of died out our idea was to resurrect them for modern women but you know the difference between when a hundred years ago and women today is that women today work\nTell me about your clientele would you your customers what do we know about them I mean you just introduced childcare rights are

or wherever and making this pitch were were were ... of all they were up there but I guess what was the reception you've got is the question\nYeah the statistics of how many women founded companies receive venture capital funding um are there really abysmal only about three percent of all I'm venture capital dollars go into business is founded by women as a woman going out to raise tens of millions of dollars\nIt's it's incredibly intimidating I'm it's intimidating to know the statistics of intimidating to walk into a room full of men in suits um around a boardroom table\nOur initial you know seed round was very challenging I'm just because there wasn't anything that had existed like this and we didn't have proof of concept yet um and there were frankly a lot of men who just said like\nI just don't get it you know I just don't get the products\nYou imagine do you foresee a day or an at I grant you that it feels like we're a long way from a no with me too and all of that but do you foresee a day where I'm this company has not needed for your services are required anymore because society has progressed [noise]\nUm you know I think that that's the goal in some ways you know [noise]\n[noise] ... let's put it this way\nFrom a very young age you know even if it's not as overt as something like me to women learn to shrink themselves um and to sort of take up less space you
