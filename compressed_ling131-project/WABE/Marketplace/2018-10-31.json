{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "There was a pretty good set of things in my Twitter mentions about things people would or would not give up check it out I'm at ... on Twitter price by the way we're the order of the day on Wall street will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\nThere are going to the Census Bureau by the Pew Research center more than twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote this coming Tuesday that's almost Thirteen percent of the entire electorate\nPolitical spending and campaign decision making or some junior mix of demographics and instinct and black magic yes so there hasn't been a whole lot of investment in ads targeting Latino voters but as much as in you'll reports from K. U. T. Austin what voters do here in Spanish language ads can be quite different from what they hear in English\nIn Texas you can see ads for Republican U.S Senate candidate Ted Cruz in English I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message that just is booming and in Spanish like this ad featuring the standards dad who came to the U.S from Cuba in the late Nineteen fifty\nRomance how about you but if I read your daughter who\nWants to keep that has seen both ads the thirty three year old off than I Do is a computer scientist and bilingual he says the Spanish it seems to take a different tack with the elder Cruz talking about the opportunities America gave him as a refugee and the American dream\nYeah you can definitely see the complete difference right so there is no talk about here's this policy here's this position is being taken eighties completely emotional\nTalking at the heartstrings has been the playbook for most political ads in Spanish says Marisa abdominal she teaches political science at the University of California San Diego\nLot of the Spanish language ads are really focused on culture on these emotional messages talking about [noise]\nAmerican Dream and my cleaner caring about family values shared values\nShe worries that Spanish only voters will be left in the dark if these ads only play on emotion and talk less about economic growth taxes or health care\nIs designed Spanish language ads that are meant and much more policy content an English language ad then Spanish speaking voters are not getting the kind of information that might not ... English language for\nAlmost a third of all eligible voters in Texas and California are Hispanic and their numbers are growing in many states across the country many of those households big predominantly Spanish the Democratic party did spend some cash this week to galvanize the Spanish speaking vote but overall is spending on Spanish language ads going through the roof\nAnswer that question is not really\nThat's Armando ... he runs in LA marketing for use to help craft teeny ads in Spanish for Republican candidates he says we won't have a clear picture of exactly how much has been spent on Spanish ads until after the midterms we do know that spending during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign was less than three million dollars down from twenty million ten years before\nAs a loser thinks eventually there's going to be a tipping point\nWhere a large part of the electorate every single year but we're still political party still under invested that outage\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads in English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish the recording one more and just requires another take not really a heavy investment the real cost of both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at\nYale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major cost and this is why I think we don't see more candidates doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person with a Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to bristle that adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture complex as the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish and the community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be the sort of thing that works better when you can target at the individual level like online advertisements\nYou're on line behavior which you search for and what you read tells a politician more about what language do you prefer than your ZIP Code does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook feed than what's on your TV [noise] in Austin, Texas I'm a dealer for marketplace [noise]\nOf all the time to start a new job running one of the biggest financial companies in this economy one would imagine that October two thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the Andrew Dell right so ... ... did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well that and you're walking in the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together\nOr as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do to the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more\nThe result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going to work every day just kind of hanging on for the ride [laughter] no it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days and CEO I was a successful in having the stock price there probably are and who knows that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you're going I mean you've found is your first Spanish services to your own financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was as a pension actuary so I I provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money\nAnd we linked up with Schwab and over a few years we became Schwab is largest client and then Schwab acquired my farm a few years after that\nYou know your boss Charles Schwab who is still the German the board and and uh active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway\nUm yeah I'm a ... he and ... and you will ... originated the concept really at scale of discount retailer brokerage and I wonder if you look around and see that everybody's catching up to you 'cause fees are going down and and all of those things are happening that have to affect your business\nWell I don't think there's any organization that's generating the net new asset flows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so so I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as you say people are catching up to us but more people understanding that\nIt is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we're doing the right thing by our clients and\nI'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per dollar on every a client asset than anyone else upside so does your mind when he was released or no you\nFeel that way generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense\nAnd to the extent we do that do reward us with more business I think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client and and also I Would say\nThat chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of of his pounding this company over four decades ago how often do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes before I got the headset on\nBurn up show if business is good uh what do you worry about as a guy who as you said managers reunion something trillion dollars worth of other people's money\nWell certainly the cyber ah environment to significant risk for for all of us um you know you're talking about thousands of attempts every single day\nTo try to access clients a counter access systems and and of course the financial environment in our country and really around the world is predicated to a great extent on trust and\nTherefore or any organization like ours has to think about cyber at the top of the list\nWell bend your president and CEO Charles Schwab both excellent up your shift up ... thanks for your time today\nTwo things about that interview first of all and full disclosure careful listeners will know and everybody should be where the Charles Schwab is an underwriter of this program also you can hear well bend your head to say about a lighter touch on banking regulations there's a spoiler alert he's good with banking regulations the way they are now did you hear it on our corner office projects [noise]\nThe thirty year term did not come down on a tablet engraved you know that says Thirty years is the right\nNumber why then all those thirty year mortgages ... first though let's do the numbers\n[noise] those shows up to forty one day nine ten percent twenty five thousand and one thing I Would not have gone to the really happening as much but when I'm ... now that I found a job a hundred and forty four points to the good you present Seventy three o five I Know we're trying to get one has to be five hundred twenty nine point one percent of the twenty seven and eleven for the month [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name":
