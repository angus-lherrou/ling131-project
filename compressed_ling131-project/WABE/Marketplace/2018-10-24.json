C. A. rules and all\nAlison Hoffman teaches health care policy at the University of Pennsylvania\nAt the same time that they're messaging that they're going to protect\nPre existing conditions Republican governors and attorney general they're fighting against the AC a in a way that would eliminate them and those protections are pretty popular across the political spectrum eighty percent of voters think that it should be illegal to deny coverage for pre existing conditions\nSo it's not surprising that all candidates have attempted to include that as part of their campaign slogans\nYeah we're seeing a lot of you know they want to take away your health care and they don't want to take away your healthcare\nSharon lions as a Democrat living in Oklahoma City Oklahoma she's been battling stage for lung cancer for years and has good insurance but\nI have been in treatment with people that have had to mortgage their homes for cancer treatment\nShe's worried that the a C a will be rolled back even more and insurance for people with preexisting conditions will become unaffordable people like her thirty year old son\nMy son had asked me when he was a teenager that's a pre existing condition you know what's next up to well I stopped my toes Twenty years ago that's pre existing condition\nPresident Trump tweeted just this morning that Republicans will totally protect people with preexisting conditions but just as an to set the conservative American Enterprise Institute says that to be tough\nRepublicans who are running on this issue need to have language out there that they want to help people with preexisting conditions but such pieces of legislation are clearly going nowhere\nAnd nowhere is home to a lot of democratic effort says well\nTried and failed to reinforce the AC a preexisting condition rules didn't get to the floor just as these Republican Proposal\nAre not getting to the floor but at the same time as an tests nobody in Congress and especially now one running for it can't afford to ignore that pre existing condition issue either in Washington I'm Kimberly Adams find my complaints\n[noise]\nComing up on the halfway marketed the NFL season and there's already talked about which players might or might not be back next year which sounds harsh until you realize that the average player in the national football league lasts just three points three years\nMarcellus wildly lasted ten years on four teams in the NFL made it to a pro bowl and then found his way to ESPN and now Fox Sports in his retirement but the idea that he would have even make it to the pros to begin with seemed far fetched his new book about his life and career and what came after that is called never shut up Marcel is one of the things coming in\nOh thank you so much so about about this book a first of all agree totally fascinating I I have to ask you about the subtitle though okay life opinions and unexpected adventures of an NFL outlier way since what are you an NFL outlier menu played mentally for ten years or ... dollars yeah I guess\nThat's not so unique but ah to get there was a unique experience coming from Columbia University or not the yellow brick road to the NFL\n... farther let's go back before Colombia right because first of all getting drafted out of Columbia which has a terrible football team in apologies to all the combat fans have to wait for you the truth I I Know you grow up like three miles down the road in yeah in South central LA I did\nI'm born and raised in Compton south central LA right here in the heart of the city in the heart of a lot of gang activity or the drugs to poverty I decided to be more responsible or with my talents and only had two which was academics in athletics\nAnd and size right I mean you're physically gifted due to right yeah I've got to be thrown in there I'm a not not my favorite story about growing up down there but uh maybe the most illustrative story is the first concussion you ever had was not on the football field\nNo it wasn't I'm Crazy enough when the concussion lawsuit came around for NFL players um they asked me what I joined it and one of the reasons I didn't join is because my first concussion was not football related it was being on a park\nSeven years old on the swings and all of a sudden I see some gangsters coming up acting like they're my friends are we going to push the little man we'll put you on me so I finally they pushed me off and I flip in the air and in the air I think I'm just going to land in the sand and now I'm a take off running\nBig voter I saw it coming for the next thing I Know me and my grandmother's house big hole in my head nice speeches later and that was another childhood experience and the other day\nSo here we are now I mean you're somebody in the world of a football and media and entertainment they catch them courses that for every one of you who plays ten years gets out reasonably helpfully and has a career afterward\nThere are probably a dozen guys who don't who are done at twenty six and can't find their way through\nYeah and that's the sad part a ... degree if they have if they had to write from a school that is not going to be resent the fact that in the real world and this is something that ... it's a touchy subject for a lot of people but I don't understand it these players get sold into the next thing you know\nThey're in these football factories were full worthless degree to the real world and then there are three years in the league they may four hundred thousand dollars a man which they blown day blown and then they're in the real world\nLike which way is up so let's go from one tricky issue to another one the politicization of the NFL today with Colin Kaepernick and taking the and those protests\nYeah um I wouldn't have taken a knee if I were an active player but I certainly would have been in full support of the calls what would've Kurt with me is what kind of kept really started to do which is okay I'm going to give a million dollars in my own money for social injustice in my community I Want that matched by my owner", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace",
