terms of it being a like a solution to the problem the problem being if you're going to make a comedy about Jesus he's going to be crucified [laughter] well yes\nUh but so with thousands of other people you know when it was the Roman method of execution\nSo you have to come up with somebody if you know that your film and you know obviously life of Brian of Jesus adjacent uh but if you know you're going to ... ... you can't end it with a wedding like most comedy can be A Midsummer Night's Dream or\nTendency to kind of bring brightness in genealogy too weird things like a kind of like

out how badly you were failing your family or as a a young man in till you kind of had a a second chance at it later in life\nOh sure I mean I I I think we were young we were you know it was a six

hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book so I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does he go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I ... particular Robin I hadn't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says thanks fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into it\nWhat it needs what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is whether the folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise] um\nYeah how ... how do you feel differently about they're passing as they you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great for going to dinner or I've gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that doesn't apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and\nJust you know to to write about people I Want you to write about I was like I'm\nLiving strategy bulk eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I like the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIs the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nNo I mainly wants us to read the books and [laughter]\nThey're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so let's just a few of us left able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly not us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\n[laughter] that's fair you're listening to ...\nI'm Jesse filling my guest is Jeff Hynes of the band blood orange why did you quit\n[noise] um this is extremely tiring I hated plane like the train and like six AM on a Sunday and it's like raining and it's gray and is this month everywhere\nAnd and it's so competitive and you know I mean I I Am pre ... competitive but not that much [laughter] you know like [laughter] like I didn't care that much and you really needed to care\nMore than I did you know like I play now and that's the level at which I care enough\nDid you have a vision for your life that was something else or were you just tired of running around in circles\nJust tired yeah that's really what it was [laughter] I didn't have any idea really what I was doing I mean if someone had asked me at that point in my life I Would probably say like writing in some regards like that\nSeemed to be what I thought maybe ... where things are going to go\nSo what changed because you've had like\nThree or four different music career at this point\nI guess it was this thing where music was always kind of in the roots of Maine but so much so that I didn't actually take that seriously 'cause you know through throughout all of those things I was making records in my bedroom and\nPlane in bands on the plane in orchestra and during like recites hills but it was always like\nThe the fun thing I was doing to kinda keep myself guard I was ... I wasn't ever chase him anything because what made me happy with just the act of doing it like I always say like I never I never sang in front of America in my bedroom I get more than\n... why did was like tape things off the radio and then like try and like recreate them\nI mean it seems to me like that might be part of why you're\nSuch an accomplished producer I mean like a lot of thinking a lot of musicians are also\nLike really passionate fans and ah I I hate the word right I'm going to use a curators\n[laughter] I'm a apologies [laughter] but like you know ... that's true of a lot a lot of musicians but like so much of your music is about ... it feels like it is about finding new ways to band aesthetics\nMm yeah\nMore than it is necessarily about like you know rocking a crowd or right you know whatever the other ... whatever the other values of pop music are many of which are totally great\nTotally I mean maybe this okay so maybe this will kind of experiment but more but like how I I'm like how I make blood orange albums especially the arts they give you an ex Freetown in this last one\nThe general trail of how them made I think kind of sums up because it tends to be this varies of course like it's not exactly like this but title\nSo like I ... the title and he goes on around the time for your dogs on was released I knew I wanted to their political and he goes on from there it was like thinking of a\nA more does that mean and imagery and I'm just trying to create like a almost like a template or like a mood board of like feelings and imagery\nLike an actual binder right like a physical yeah ... not\nMetaphorically yeah this is exactly ... book of inches and birds and from there once I'm kind of putting that together I have these ideas of uh\nThe music kind of attaches itself to the imagery from me so I have an idea of these different things are feeding as I tend to make actually these like playlists and mix tapes for myself of other people's music that\nIs feeding into it but then within that I've I find I see the things I'm missing or the things I Want to\nFeel an and meld together so that's kind of forming but it like the music doesn't exist you know in my head this kind of thing and then I'm Bryson words down so I started rising of woods and then I kind of like\nKind of work it out like I have an idea of why I think it's ... so I knew I wanted to open a record I knew the change I wanted to go for in the middle and I kind of knew how to end it and then I kind of like fit it in and I make that moved\nYou know [laughter] it's kind of a weird way and so old attracts tend to actually finish\nAt the same time in the mix and versus region when I'm ... makes in the record will just before that the tracks start to finish because it's hard for me to finish track to if I Know I haven't finished ... three\nSo it's really rare that like I could play a track to someone but I'll feel weird about it 'cause I Know that it needs to\nIt but it's all going to affect everything else so they they tend to hit the finish line at the same time\nWe'll wrap up my conversation with Deb Heinz after a break silicon what's it like when did he had your phone number and returned your calls defined has the answer ... from ... dot org and NPR\nListening to members took part in Ninety One tell you a B.
