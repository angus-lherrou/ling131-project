along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people live three thousand miles from me [laughter] I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right and uh either it occurred\nTo not be responsible to in for this job in this group of people and um the people I worked for and with\nAn over time it became a very sentimental thing to recall and I was in the Celtic as I walked the streets and remembered what we shot on that corner and and that corner in that street in that alley but I never felt\nI regretful um it it was as full and rich inexperience as I could it could ever have hoped for and I never felt\nBurden I never felt resentful of the association or that it was limiting the in some way or that it I wanted some of that time back I just felt like I had been ...\nSomething where I got to play a character who was complicated and flawed and night and I loved figuring her her out and I got to live this alternate in similar I got it on an alternate universe spending more time sometimes being somebody else and be myself and\nUm it was so full and\nSo even now when I talk about it it's it's hard to imagine Ninety One hundred hour weeks but I I wouldn't have changed any of it [laughter]\nI like your actual day to day life was essentially a

[laughter]\nI ... I since I had a whole\nConversation we are churn Oregon on the show relented a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like ah I think he looks so heads of wood that moustache me too I think it's so great and it's so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly like dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous [noise]\nWilliam and Mary perfect way if it is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nAt ... totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about\nWhat I Hope this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I wanted the music to look like and the costumes and\nSeventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it did so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter]\nI Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or who was interested in music would have a reaction not just to that obviously to the source music but to the compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was\nIt so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell they're just good worker a I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that or you came in to talk to us uh I really appreciate you taking the time\nI'm like how a couple of things about this one if I guess I'm wheel and let's say out of here and you never get to see it and two if your guest right away we have ...\nAt all and I love that is already feel\nLike a late night you see any short circuits out\nHere [noise]\nThis is the theory I wanted to give you is it to some extent the format of your show feels like an institutionalization of your mania\nWhich is to say that you found a way to have a ... absurd commitment to terrible ideas that comes from mania that is from what I've been told them what's been described me totally amazing yeah without necessarily specifically having to be at a map [laughter]\nYes my certainly it's funny 'cause you know I certainly as an artist\nI don't think you making art has sorted out my issues in any way Caribbean a meditation have done that but I Do think that our became a healthy way to direct some stuff that wasn't always healthy I think there's certainly a type of endorphin or adrenaline and then I clearly need in my head\nAnd uh it's better for it to happen over the airwaves in a in a way that's intentional\nThan to let it just said in day to day so yeah I think I think your your your observations are correct for sure it is bad ideas like when we started together to use the baby for public actually that I started every show by saying\nI Want this to go well I put a lot of thought into it I really genuinely hope it goes well but if it doesn't my promise to you is that the disastrous\nOr other potential outcome will be as entertaining as if it went well like if we crash and burn you're going to love watching that probably more than you will if there's even goes well that's always been an attitude that I stand by\n... more with Chris gathered after a quick break he'll tell me about how after years of his star being on the rise she still has time to get in fights with his fans on the Internet it's bull's eye for maximum fund dot org and NPR\n[noise] you're listening to members deported Ninety One W.

I'm Jesse for my guest Chris gathered is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which his book stores October sixteenth we talked last year\nWhat are the things you talk about in your special show\nWhere a suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to your career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be emotionally healthy because of that yeah\nUm two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that\nThe second part is do you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not capital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like\nIf you got cast on as the second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom was an evil but neither was it a place for teenagers can come out right\nRight it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a\nChip on his shoulder that my work clearly has now\nAt like ... I'm definitely a workaholic it's a problem it's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go away tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit for stability\nAnd they've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nIt's I have to admit that I was right going for this and so I have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... cop to the fact is like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that ask at New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and after now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get with my next gig ... might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say\nSome of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest Joe generate shows more funding they said that Joe than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some others yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course\nIt doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know have their mission statement of trying to like break the system sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I I think hard about it because there's a there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know he's not outing ... my indie credibility at this point like\nAnyone who knows my work would say that guy spent years\nBending over backwards to try to do this thing and at times he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I could move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel a lot of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up the competing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work and I'm not quite there yet\nBut I Would love to be because I I feel like one of the things I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in had to just kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them do not have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen\nSo that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs\nThat could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world's but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody to us right [noise]\nIt's ... I'm Jesse Thorn I'm Talking with the comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now\nFriend of mine was telling me this past week it has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of warning for my friends told this company for sixty five million dollars not only does is make bad art and I was like a dream make bad art yeah\nI mean it's already make it better I Would have been doing for years [laughter] yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad art that's perfect", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
