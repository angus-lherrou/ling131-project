in Washington support\nAnd you haven't lived this way or had the experience that we've had so it's kind of hard for you to come out and say that I interviewed a a\nSociologist who also does a lot of work with DNA at Columbia her name was Alondra Nelson and she said the problem with doing these DNA tests and then claiming oh I'm really German instead of Italian or I'm really whatever is that\nDNA is technical an identity is social there's actually a cat really mix the two that running a parallel track and\nShe got to live an entire life as a white woman mhm and get whatever you get out of that also it's like the one time we have a national conversation about native people they're centered on white people have bills\nWe're I mean in some ways it's like going forward how should we talk well and I always had a question because there was this weird thing in American culture of like I got you know my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess or something I really awkward I mean people I think say it less and less but like\nYou know is it time to just sort of reckoning with all of that and like actually learn the history of which tribes inter married in which tribes didn't and what does that mean and what does it mean to the ... and even if we were led us and that is to say that in America probably only about five percent of us have really any native blood\nAt a I have\nThree words okay they are no not yet okay what does that mean I was talking about how it feels as if we are already in campaign twenty twenty\n... oh yeah oh no no [laughter]\nAnd I'm bringing this up

and it got national coverage and I saw a journalist from New York and DC live tweeting this thing there are ... more than one pot task about vets over yet he's\nRunning for the Senate not for president and it seems as if he has become this great hope for liberals especially in this season the Trump\nBut even on his best days the polls have him down by like at least five points\nRight the coverage has has shifted um and then the conversation was about how much money he's raised and then there was a big question about is he going to share that with other ... Democrat yeah other national races where Democrats are neck and neck for Senate races\nIn ... in tight states is he going to help them when you and the answer was basically no money and it was like and then since the narrative kind of became but\nThat's okay if we can go and it's what he's going to run in twenty like literally ... twenty yeah right\nThere are already polls of democratic candidates coming out for twenty twenty it's insane and the other candidate that is making me think of twenty twenty already is Elizabeth Warren ... because you know she had this video out about her ancestry she talks about Donald Trump Donald Trump is in the video [noise]\nEveryone forgets she's running for reelection in the Senate this year against someone named Jeff deal\nI've been talking about like we hoo ha I go to I've been talking to folks yes week who don't actually know that she's running for Senate this year because they all think she's running against\nAll truncated write a letter I Want to twenty yeah yeah no I I don't want to live in this world just yet yeah I don't I'm not ready for it yet let it be don't talk to you about Iowa layout offered me a poll start raising not there at the state fair on a stick\nOn it I don't want to see him in ... well because you don't want it [laughter] the entire political\nSystem will go on whole day one before I let us know that's what I'm asking the areas that you know Yoda brave [laughter]\nWhen we come back we will talk about some serious case of fake poke study appearing in real academic journals and also later my chat with Rudy Valdez HBO documentary about his sister while she was in prison you're listening to its benefit from NPR we'll be right back\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to it's been a minute with Sam Sanders and only one W.

Sam and Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded podcast hello Hi\nQuick question for both of you before we get back to the news\nUm have either have you ever been to Nebraska for fun\nKind of work [noise] um I drove the length of the state and um I remember it being the parts die with two very beautiful Kelly yeah see I already grew up in the cornfields and the fiery so um no\n[laughter] so I bring this up because the state of Nebraska is that what the new ad campaign to boost tourism to Nebraska but their whole sticking point is that the state is boring and that's why you should come\nAfter this year right yeah you know to argue worn out by the chaos that you see it right I got it under the raft guide US law literally every now and\n[laughter] their slogan in one ad is lucky for you there's nothing to do here\nI think that's genius [laughter] I think they should tell people\nTake that take a drive through the ... you know like yeah they like the Internet turned off as soon as you could ask as we ain't got no I've I Know a lot of it yeah social media like coming up Yeah John Rick's runs Nebraska's tourism commission and he talked to NPR on Thursday and explain what this campaign is all about\nNebraska is a place where on his perspectives and life simple pleasures help you realize what matters most\nYou know I never had any desire to go to Nebraska now I'm going\nI'll do it it would ask grey eye on somebody's front porch [laughter] I'm On a vet that person for hours [laughter] yeah that you know I'm I I don't care about the conversations that died\nAt All right in other wacky news I Want us to talk about a story in academia\nAnd strange fight happening in that world over the last year or so these really crazy studies have started to show up in some peer reviewed journals one was a study about rape culture at Portland dog parks among dogs\nAnother study argued that professional bodybuilding is bigoted because it doesn't include a category for quote fat body building and then another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mine comes\nWith feminist buzzwords yeah so all these studies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research\nThese ... call it grievance studies they associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nI had to get to the bottom of this so I called up one of the three ... hello Jens Lindsey hello he's a mathematician\nMy backgrounds in what's called ... which sounds that sounds hard it's it's basically solving puzzles\nAnd I had a lot of questions for him but first had to understand what he means by the phrase grievance studies\nGrievance studies is this is a little bit of a complicated term because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct grievance study is is something it up a method\nThat is an approach to studying certain things to be really really Chris was it the actual definition would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive ism which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics that are regulated in language\nAnd so the studies come from a position of not just say social marginalization or pressuring or surgery quality but rather one of actual grievance where they believe that the system is rigged against them and they're frustrated with that\nAll of us read heads in the u._k. are wildly excited\nBecause of the new royal baby yeah man I\nRead I don't know I didn't know she was pregnant you know she was pregnant by her red headed has been yeah there is some higher for that they will be a red headed yeah what they may be not prepared for is if they have a really brown skin read because ginger genes\nSo that quote comes from Jackie call is Harvey who was from the u._k. and it was ...\nRead it in and who has a book called red a history of the red head we know that Prince Harry and Meghan Merkel announced that she is with child this week and I actually love these little storylines I Love a good real baby\nAnd this is really a royal baby because she's roiled by marriage but this big there'll be roiled by Burt yeah not royal adjacent isn't over oil well once you're the mom of one of those yeah mhm you're and\nIt's also like there are all these questions like well this may be black will it be redhead and I'm like it'll be rich [laughter] it\nDoesn't matter and it was a baby very very low yeah yeah so that may be a party line drawing Mike around looking for a picture great granted a little bit with this little brown baby on her lap\nLast quote ready okay I ain't dead snitches amusing another word for the radio [laughter] who was killed off in something this week oh oh this is Roseanne yeah\nMy hero for\nOver here and the only reason I remember is because I was actually looking to the news and they were

but it all changed one morning when the feds came knocking the arrest them Cindy for something she was involved in years before an ex boyfriend had been a drug dealer and because she knew what he was doing and didn't report it she was committing a crime\nMandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain drug offenses meant that Cindy was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison\nThis movie is about Cindy struggle to get out answer struggle to keep being a mother to her three young daughters while she was in prison and the whole movie is directed by Cindy whose brother Rudy vile death he actually began filming the day Cindy went to prison\nAnd found the life of my daughters um I was given a sentence of Fifteen Years in two thousand and eight and my daughters were for two and six weeks old and Rudy starts to film their lives and if it films what actually happens to families that are left behind on these um\nLong sentences in what happens what truly happens to families yeah\nAnd these long sentences like there's a name for this kind of sentence the mandatory minimums we should explain briefly what the idea of these minimum is and how some folks say it has hurt families like yours\nYeah I mean they're all you know products of this war on drugs that started in the late seventies early eighties\nWhere the sentences which would have been posed based on weights and based on different criteria when you're facing a drug sense especially in the federal level\nAnd I'm a lotta people refer to what happened to my sister as the girlfriend problem yeah which is basically you know she was knowledgeable about what was happening in you know the household she was living in but she didn't go to the police\nAnd you know subsequently she was sentences if she were the person actually buying and selling the drug yeah what exactly had your boyfriend your um your ex boyfriend been doing lay out the case for us\nWell um he had he was a drug dealer and he had started selling drugs in when after we started our relationship and he\nWas actually murdered and that is when the federal government came across everything that he was doing\nAnd they initially indicted me in two thousand and two and dismissed my case why to dismiss it they you know the feds picked up they dropped it state picked it up state dropped it and I got a letter from my attorney saying that my case had been dismissed\nUm it was really trying time at that time 'cause we're gee you know it was quite a whirlwind with the murder and then be in charge initially and then you know I Lived with my life and\nAbout my life back up put my pieces back together and then only to have them come back later and\nTake me away six years later and ... and so what did they actually convict you of I Know it was some kind of conspiracy charge you like what was the the the formal sentence\nI was actually given um for felonies or we'll charge 'em with possession within tend to distribute a cocaine crack marijuana and also conspiracy I was charged with all of his current\nWhen they came to you years after your ex boyfriend had died years after you moved on to start a new life with a new husband children of your own [noise]\nWhen they said we're going to lock you up did you think that any sentence would be fair or do you think this and then you to prison at all was wrong\nKnow I I've gotten asked this question quite a bit and it's hard for me to say because it's me out of you know I don't want to go to prison\nI understand that you know people make a choice and you know I I knew what he was doing so yes I I I think that some sentence would have been fair you know on some level but you have to also understand the prosecutor asked for eighty nine years for me oh my goodness I\nI was given the mandatory minimum the judgment as low as he could go his hands were tied that was the lowest yeah that was the lowest go he could go no lower because of mandatory minimum laws um\nI just feel you know hey maybe I'd never I never even had a speeding ticket you know so I kind of like two years three years maybe and maybe you know probation for ten years I have no problem you know checking in doing what I have to do and you know following the letter of the line\nOr not to interrupt but I think like the whole the whole thing with the sentence with her getting Fifteen Years is that it is such an arbitrary number you know what I mean I think that as sensing goes we should", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "21"}
