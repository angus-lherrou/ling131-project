NPR News in Washington\nSo then so California puts these rules in place on the state level\nThe Trump de OJ sous but the bigger point for me is that this is yet\nAnother example of California showing a type of resistance to Trump that may not be the first thing that we think about when we say the word resistance like we say that word we think of people on the ground protesting but there was a resistance so the Trump White house coming from state houses\nChris what does this kind of legal resistance how effective is\nI mean a lot of it is from the ages it's from California a jeep Sarah it's from uh New York AG Barbara Underwood\nAlso there have been some some counties Santa Clara county in California San Francisco county\nYou basically have always had this I mean if you remember all of Texas law suits against stop on DACA under the Obama administration has this has been\nBuilt the way for the age of the other party of the president to sort of\nTry and say we're back to our dual sovereignty\nThey it it states trying to say we want to do our thing and we should be allowed to do so um is that more effective than protesters just on the ground saying stop Donald Trump I mean I think they're two totally different things I think that the\nReality of what Trump has done has led to a lot of lawsuits that probably regardless of the the\nEnvironment on the ground democratic ... would've fought back against but the the fact is that in a liberal state you cannot go wrong\nRight now a fire Donald Trump putting their name yeah by getting a lawsuit that is your name the\nTrump some more to come for sure you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here we are too great guests today are we going to sell your business correspondent for NPR and Chris guiding her legal editor for bus feed news arena did you get three words\nDo my three words are up to Fifteen and I don't know where that out okay that's about Amazon money yeah dollars\nI'm so Amazon made huge waves this week uh announcing that the company will raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid workers uh up to Fifteen dollars so this is mainly a four warehouse workers and\nThis is because I don't know if you knew this but Amazon is now the second largest private employer in the United states really it was the first Wal Mart's so the number one Amazon's number two and\nHuh this changeable effect by Amazon's estimates a three hundred and fifty thousand workers this year and a lot about a third of them are are ... are expected seasonal hires 'em and did you know what the federal minimum wage is it's seven dollars and twenty five ... oh my God\nOkay um so this is much higher than that\nIt's like double it's remarkable to me means thinking how how long it's\nBeen since I had my first job and\nIt hasn't changed that much change and actually I remember it was five something when I was just starting out and then if you want to seven while I was still like an adolescent but it's been there for a long yeah so my question the arena is like\nIs it fair or unfair that I saw this news from Amazon and said\nOh well it's also a PR ploy you know they've had some critique of their business practices how they treat employees they've had some critique over the fact that Jeff Bezos is so rich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is is the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR that convenience or element to this to give you an example Senator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers and hats\nAnd finding Amazon like he's been coming out for a while\nNow introduced a bill that's called stop basis act out you know that no ... [laughter]\nYeah and on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's yes PR is definitely part of it\nAnd another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it can't hurt\nHelps them attract workers while I\nCan talk about Amazon all day as you know when\nYou look at it [laughter]\nI just signed for break or when we come back I'm going to talk with two high school students in Texas and their friends nominated them to be on the home of course a but they're both young women and if it off a bit of a firestorm and later my conversation with film director hike Baron holds\nHe turned his politically charged Thanksgiving dinners into a comedic thriller that we all can relate to listening to it's been a minute for NPR we'll be right back\n[noise]\nThis is not a boy one W.
