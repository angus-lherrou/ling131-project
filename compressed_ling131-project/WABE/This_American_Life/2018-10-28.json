we revisit a charge of it it is not very pleasant what we try and take for example our next guest when he was a teenager he started reading the biography of David been gory in the first prime minister of Israel and one of the things that he learned is that all of his life David Ben Gurion kept a\nDiary and the whole package seemed like a good idea job diary\nThird Nineteen eighty six Wednesday another fascinating day in the life of Adam Davidson I have a math test tomorrow I'm going to school early to tutor a girl in my class for the aforementioned test\nMy math class a joint pre calculus and calculus class consists mainly of seniors not especially interested in learning I guess that I'm the quote class expert unquote and then I always do the math problems which no one else can\nAnd for this I'm disliked\nI guess that because I apply myself think clearly and do a little work as well as some and tell us\nHelping out I Am a geek in truth I'm far from it when you first um ... read that to yourself when you first side of your reaction was it was pure heart [noise]\nRecently Adam Davidson and occasional contributor to our program found his old high school diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli status American and grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York [noise]\nHis brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel\n[laughter] to me [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation\nAnd there are a regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp\nThat was right before I started writing this diary\nGreatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing if the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being I Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam\nAnd wash out will generate here comes out of it was on Capitol [laughter]\n[laughter] wow [laughter] [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's it's kind of amazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I Am the prime minister of Israel in in what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably ... funds recite that at some point or the ball game or something and that the thing is you're right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that\nBut I don't know I mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation ...\nTo actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much ... every other aspect of my life\n[laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just have your petty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nYou'd be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio peace", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28"}
