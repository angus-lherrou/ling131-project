this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue it reads and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward\nMr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shows or forward originally email to spin the ones you send two years ago the one who can stop thinking about\nWhat I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks ... for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that fed\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nJoking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get back to ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing view on the coffee or tea Maryland is a child in stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll make sure you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you\nKnow if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn she'd get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly
