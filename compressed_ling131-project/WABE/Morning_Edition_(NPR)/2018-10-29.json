I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president John ... and narrow and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man that I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThe union for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo try to remind him and the people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they see is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio\nRainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't\nThat he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as his promise to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people here David a sick of robberies and the sky high mood right\nYet the prospect of more guns ... police violence those are concerns a lot of people [noise] because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I Am not found out about that concerned when I visited a ... or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and as popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and it's ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the fall of Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have a meeting trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status or police there is simply to uphold our laws\nThere's for essence of the human rights commission on ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seem from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but all of them only be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with\nOf well out of ah the the number that we have a ... a thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugees that this one thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been ... factory added to the states so right now it's\n... I think that a lot of them will in fact ended up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican Garber\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ... the carbon was a little bit bigger\nBut I'm Around two thousand I mention of or fire no regional coastal five thousand have already a ... percent that their requests for refugee status\nOf this as important in front of us perspective ambassador because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are fairly inning tend to get to the U.S and we have ghost corporation where U.S authorities to handle this in the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the car to have such he's around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and this the situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that uh these these can vote that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\nAmbassador thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for this space around them all the terrorists as Mexico's ambassador to the United states\nThe killings at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh follow what the Anti Defamation league says is an historic fifty seven percent rise in anti Semitic incidents

Semitism was the motivator for more than half of all reported anti religious hate crimes and twenty sixteen the most recent year data is available\nIt doesn't appear Bowers was known to law enforcement he did have a history of anti Semitic and anti immigrant social media posts online he accused the nonprofit founded by Jews that now help refugees of all stripes of bringing quote invaders

D. U. slash NPR\nYeah It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president ... and our own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man that I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read to help pass the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects still\nHad to remind him and and people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as homophobia\nHe's really on it he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than
