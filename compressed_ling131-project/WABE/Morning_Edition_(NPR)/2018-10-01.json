between where you are and the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries Jedi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on

brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that right now it's just kind of share math median income\nIn Charlotte and a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity atlas for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward

Christian joins say it's just not top of mind\nLike if your class and work here do unto you know I feel like flu shots not very harmless priorities\nYeah something of a huge portion other day and trying to get it these\nStudents say they plan to get a flu shot if they haven't already and one factor that may motivate them as last winters death toll with eighty thousand flu related deaths it was the highest death toll and more than forty years and hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized\nWilliam Schaffner is medical director at the national foundation for infectious diseases\nWill it was an extraordinary season and we had a very vicious virus the so called H three and two influenza strain\nSchaffner says it's too soon to say if this will be a severe flu season but he says that's no reason to wait to get vaccinated Schaffner says it's true that people sixty five and older are at higher risk but\nHe says young adults are vulnerable\nTo the flu can even on occasion take a young healthy person to put them in the intensive care unit in forty eight hours we can't pick you out in advance so let's all get protected\nOn the George Washington campus the student health center is going all out to get students vaccinated Isabel golden ... medical director she's organized to pop up clinics in students' favorite hangout spots we wait for them to come to us today she's getting shots in the library Peter ... freshmen walks in\nUh definitely I'm not a big fan of noodles but you know sickness can spread really fast on campus and I just wanted to prevent myself from getting sick and from anyone else with him or her own\nTheater what do you want right or left let's take the famous shot at from this one to the scene\nAfter such a bad flu season last year many people know the vaccine is not a hundred percent effective but what many people don't realize is if you get the flu shot and still end up catching the virus your sickness is likely to be significantly less severe student max ... says he'll take\nSome protection over no protection I've had the flu which was horrible and so after that experience I\nDon't see a reason why even risk it without getting\nSays he thinks one way to motivate young people get the flu shot it would be a social media campaign where people share that\nFlu stories I asked him what he called\nA campaign [noise] um [noise]\nThe boots of the flu I don't know that just came up with that now I I like I said it's got the ring and maybe it's a reminder to get\nI don't care if the state that represents them is Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction name these are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity is parity in which they fulfill themselves as individuals and groups\nIn every possible way that any American or British press that our Chinese person wouldn't\nWell Palestinians today I've traveled going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is Palestinians are denied estate millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter different like he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister [noise]\nLook I think people mean different things when they started going into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement as the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us\nKeep our must not be in their hand is the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean\nIt's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're both Palestinians and Israelis Lou Israel must return the overriding security responsibility\nOtherwise we'll good what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd the basically a militant Islam came in under who by law observing through on or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them off do if you have a state that have most of sovereign ...\nBut not the our security is the other state or not if I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position I bet it very very clear both through the previous administration under the Trump and\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago in a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is not an either\nOr model I think we have a third model in the very least which is basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which is littered with failed states that's often the best you can do at least try to do something else you know you've got to Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of\nIsrael but you want Israel is still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government outgoing flak they have their own\nWell they have any of them died now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin in or out loose are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger ISIL\nNeither this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have bought and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\n[noise] uh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about uh uh terrorists in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk with an attack as we were at\nThe un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has has bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel has had a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful bond\nThere there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you've seen that we could have agreements and disagreements with previous administrators for example we had a you know it's no secret of how to disagree with\nPresident Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming\nDecade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nPrime minister Netanyahu it's always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much factors do good to talk to\nIsrael's Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to join us and that invitation remains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\n\nKeep your head on the marketplace morning report the major league baseball even in tonight mind games will determine who played the Atlanta Braves in the first time in the playoffs\nTrend in small thing up pitchers is costing teams a lot more will look at that and all the morning's business news and just under ten minutes but first step in the ...

where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nYou see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on

lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder Carmen
