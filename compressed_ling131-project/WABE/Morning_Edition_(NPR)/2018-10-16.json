America seem read and twenty Fifteen that after Cochran wrote a book that compared homosexuality to ...\nDrew criticism from Chuck Hoskins secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation who joins us now from ... to Oklahoma ...\nMorning Steve I Walk in the program I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this everyday remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign nation that it's been around since before the United states or do you have people who live within of course the United states how do you determine today who use and using the Cherokee\nWell first of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially the to a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs ... um that role exist a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates death records then you can establish yourself as a turkey citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens in the country most of them living\nOur territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country and we have a very rigorous process uh and it's about documentation and\nDriving back to that ... genealogy and sent it to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is DNA irrelevant to that\nWell DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples\nIn North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular group of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nOr was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied in part to federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was more on said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a try but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAnd then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story [noise] um and then we are now at the point where she is taking a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they\nDon't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have very specific\nAh means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nWell there's a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAre so many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly a extinguished by the government United States\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she's been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country as people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the ... in the United states should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there and we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWe think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat so I don't think he does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to\nTalk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this was an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country uh there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple of\nWell in in some ways it's been positively made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for\nExample in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with a silver changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns is at times when there's proposed budget that reduce things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education things of that matter so um we need we need a federal government that will listen to tribes that will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nAre and so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help for the rest of the United states attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA DNA results\nWell ms Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate it thanks very much Steve Chuck Hoskins is

W E s hum that role exist a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved to things like birth certificates death records\nUh then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens in the country most of them live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country we have a very rigorous process uh and it's about documentation and driving back to that those rows\nUnion genealogy and get back to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation of one time why is DNA irrelevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples in North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular\nGroup of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nations we existed before the United states uh was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied in part to federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand it was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was with Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well a family story says I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a dry but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAnd then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very ...\nCivic means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA I really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nWell there's a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\n... many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly extinguished by the government you know states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that erodes what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be depressed in the United states should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country our because the needs are there we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it said Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribe and and if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat so I don't think he does what he ought to do as the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this was an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country uh there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nOf well in in some ways it's been positive we've made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for\nExample in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns is at times when there's proposed budget that reduce things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education and things of that matter so\nUm we need we need a federal government that will listen to tribes that will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nAnd so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the president United States attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA DNA results\nWell Mr ... thanks very much really appreciate it\nThanks very much Steve ... is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma\n\nIs Ninety point one W.
