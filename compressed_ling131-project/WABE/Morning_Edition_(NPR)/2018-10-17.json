Rican flags\nBut just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing Scott's opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I Am endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping people avoid those\nBut even in endorsing Nelson the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans arriving after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses\nAnd through that all he's won over some skeptics\nMe be very honest

plans to vote for Scott this November\nHernandez ... is a democratic pollster in Miami he says there are really two main strategies for any Republican to win Florida you either maximize the white vote or you chip away at the Hispanic vote\nPolling shows Nelson has the support of a majority of Latino voters but a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican men and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that she was in a position to trying to deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is a concern of many Democrats because potentially could opened any plans to recapture the chamber\nBut a Monday says even though Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in a year where at least the political atmosphere conditions suggest that it's good to be a Democrat\nDemocrats insist the choice is clear when you look at

Hispanic population has nearly tripled but now since campaign dismisses the criticism Amy McCotter a state lawmakers supporting Nelson says Scott might be more visible but that's not a reason\nTo vote for it honestly I don't think that's the most important thing the fact that you see somebody all the time doesn't make them effective it's what they're doing that I think the most important so actions
