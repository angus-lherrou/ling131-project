black power salute on the podium by Tommy Smith and John Carlos that got all the headlines Carlos his roommate at those games was it thirty one year old runner named Melvin tender he was a platoon leader in Vietnam when he got the call to compete and recently came to story corps with his friend Keith seems to talk about that moment\nThis is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included Audrey law\nDid those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active as I Would\nHave oh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University Good morning guys for much for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought used this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nThat couldn't be harder for I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just a one for the most money being spent how much money are we talking about here well Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\n... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate read just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr\nAlso had I known anti bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district you absolutely do and in fact you hear it on the radio bitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for the bars and restaurants\nAnd online as to you can't ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in ...\nTalking wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she was a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool [noise] um [noise] I mean I I dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means and I bought anything\nNothing like I I went to a majority black college it's one of the only white girl on the team and we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reasons to support President Trump because he kinda as you say your calls BS and all this and you you kind of agree with\nThat kind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't feel like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions of the state\n[noise] well I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white\nIn this way in Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divide in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and so to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here Al Cross we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state has the\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits or so the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a article which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and there are multiple people say I don't understand but this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of\nUm Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict can track often that's been racialized right quite often it addressed um toward immigrants and the threat has immigrant but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state I'm a the a racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls from two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace note they said that race was eight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in this congressional election\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are who are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat to each of you think about as you hear that voice\nI think him out on the feelings they've heard across the number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic be at racial ... ideological\nAt that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people out cross you get the last word\nI've voted ... voters need to remember that the choices binary and binary choice is gradually move or a U.S through a continuum of history but each election as a binary choice and ah I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOkay ... thanks very much to both of you we're live at

W. A. B. E. news\nMeanwhile more than forty thousand Georgians had already cast their ballots by mail for the November midterm elections that's double the number of votes cast at this time four years ago and it's all state political scientist Kerwin sweat says those early numbers show this ... mid term election is getting more attention from voters\nAnd the other person I talked to had surgery scheduled but of course that's been postponed now in the hospital he was going to be in is then evacuated some say they stayed because with a blocked roads and the police checkpoints it's so hard to get back to your home after the storm you hear this here and many other places\nAre everyday ways and the other day for a house that's missing windows or roofs take even more damage uniform rain and from the outside elements\nAny idea when residency did evacuate will be allowed back\n[noise] that's not clear at this point you know for now the county says only first responders and work crews are being allowed back in even local residents are being told us not safe you have to return to people who were there we talked to some of them wanted to go out and started looking for supplies like ice maybe pick up a generator\nBut they were told that they left they wouldn't be able to come back and so they felt feel kind of trapped there we also talked to some people who can't get their cars out because there's so much rubble power lines down on the road you know it's a very difficult situation\nBut you know help is on the way as we were leaving we saw local residents say they're being told by FEMA but there's some really should be coming and there'll be ...\nAnd the restoration of cell phone service and just quickly with the infrastructure of being in ruins how'd you get there yesterday\nWell it it was a quite a long hard drive and we came from Tallahassee which is two and a half hours away usually took nine hours while major road including interstate ten was blocked we've all road crews for quite a while as the trees to get there\nBy the time we go to Mexico beach or we have sauce people were surprised to see is because not many people had arrived there at that point NPR's Greg Allen thanks [noise] You're welcome\nEarly in the Trump Administration the regular White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those briefings have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has the story\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders last walked up to the lectern in the White House press briefing room on October\n... cause if everybody this year\nIt had been twenty three days since she last\nFree suppress\nDissent timber jobs report continues America's economic winning streak under\nBefore that there had been in Eighteen day stretch with no briefing briefing has clearly falling off falling off a cliff Martha joint Kumar is a political scientist who for years has sat in on the White House briefings it's\nAn important forum for the public and we shouldn't let it go\nThe number of briefings began declining in the spring falling below levels of the last two administrations at the same point in their presidency's it dropped precipitously in the past\nTwo months the briefings have also gotten shorter about twenty five percent shorter on average from the first year of the Trump Administration meanwhile in recent days President Trump has been speaking for himself a lot\nFor anymore she\nIt can be cautious yes there was any other questions I don't know\nOn air force one on the tarmac on the south lawn of the White House in the oval office and calling into Fox\nNews' Mike McCurry was press secretary for President Bill Clinton\nFrom ... Xiong pressured her and he's the one from every day and I I'm not even sure he likes it he's got some pressure\nMcCrary was Clinton spokesman during the star investigation and other challenging news cycles\nMany times where I Would have been happy to just remote briefing luscious but\nHe didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a response you know democratic duty\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for this story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all and end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly in this age\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation and the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the purpose of the briefing has shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and name right\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised events that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W. Bush now bemoan the state of the briefing\nThe good government on paper side of me says of course there should be a regular briefings the realist watching the hostility between the Trump White house on the press corps in both directions says what's the point to the ... there's no news is just hostility\nHe points to exchanges like this one I don't have any problem stating facts know John\nYou probably do\nThe guilt\nDana Perino who also served as press secretary for George W. Bush says regular briefings have value the press secretary\nIs it just speaking to the press Xi speaking to the whole world\nIt is a mutually beneficial thing for a daily briefing to take place\nMutually beneficial she says because taking questions forces the administration to hone its policy and message it's a kind of accountability Purina says she welcomed\nInternally when the cabinet or the staff knows that the press secretary has to got an answer questions from the press it can force decision making or consensus\nThat question how am I going to explain this to the press can be a powerful motivator parakeet NPR News\n[noise]\n\n[noise] this is not a boy one W.

method drop all pumped into an irrigation ditch turn it on and if you don't have the water rights to do that it's a crime\nMethod number two you have rights to water but not a lot so you take more

since the county started in forcing water law but it's the fragile peace\nHistorically we've had people killed over water in the state of Colorado we have in this county\nHuman is on patrol in a part

You're welcome\nEarly in the Trump Administration the regular White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those briefings have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this story\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders last walked up to the lectern in the White House press briefing room on October\n... cause if everybody this year\nIt had been twenty three days since she last\nFree press Hernandez is Kimber jobs report continues America's economic winning streak under\nBefore that there had been in Eighteen day stretch with no pre anything briefing has clearly falling off falling off a cliff Martha joined Kumar is a political scientist who for years has sat in on the White House briefings pits an important forum\nFor the public and we shouldn't let it go\nThe number of briefings began declining in the spring falling below levels of the last two administrations at the same point in their presidents sees it dropped precipitously in the past\nTwo months the briefings have also gotten shorter about twenty five percent shorter on average from the first year of the Trump Administration meanwhile in recent days President Trump has been speaking for himself a lot\nAnymore she's\nCan be a tough question gets their question any other questions I don't know that you know on air force\nOn the tarmac on the south lawn of the White House in the

got some spokesman\nMcCrary was Clinton spokesman during the star investigation and other challenging news cycles\nMany time for I Would have been happy just briefing let's just go\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just it was a response from democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for this story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all and end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly in this age\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration its utility decreased\nDynamic and the purpose of the briefing has shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and name right\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature the briefings shouldn't be live televised events that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W. Bush now bemoan the state of the briefing\nThe good government on paper side of me says of course there should be a regular briefing the realist watching the hostility between the Trump White house on the press corps in both directions says what's the point of the ... there's no news is just hostility\nHe points to exchanges like this one but I don't have any problems if I don't have any problem stating facts no John\nThere I just do that then you probably do have a problem\nThe\nGuilt Dana Perino who also served as press secretary for George W. Bush says regular briefings had value the press secretary isn't just speaking to the press Xi speaking to the whole world\nIt is a mutually beneficial thing for a daily briefing to take place\nMutually beneficial she says because taking questions for says the administration to hone its policy and message it's a kind of accountability Purina says she welcomes internally\nWhen the cabinet or the staff knows that the press secretary has to got an answer questions from the press it can force decision making or consensus\nThat question how am I going to explain this to the press can be a powerful motivator parakeet NPR News\nIs not equally one W.
