rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country or I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course denied any involvement with the

occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company and the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at ExxonMobil had announced that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change centrist China the\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Bert ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nRepublicans in particular there's an increasing number of\nMembers of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way or sugar coating or Republicans today to embrace any new tax difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal soon acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term

Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision a there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really gonna make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can you explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation sub move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act or they said no relief that the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog in gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the state so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that looked pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of compliments with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us move though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it yeah I think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mentioned faces a political reality has stayed is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mansion on election day here's West Virginia public radio message\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n[noise]\nCircles just spent [noise] surgeon at arm's order and\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston and the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office\nMiller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says she was a tenant and listen to their concerns\nBut after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you will do on election\nDay I didn't vote for him um during the primary but\nI I had that for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognize that mention is new liberal but has defended him in the past I have been\nA person who has been the person to say to someone that we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen says she won't vote for mentioned in November Emily comer came to a similar decision she's a public schoolteacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion conversation will leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Marcy either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that it's going to fight for us\nAll three women so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer that voting record is a sign that mentioned as an independent thinker computer was a democratic state lawmaker for mansions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted them to do and and and they did they acted accordingly\nOr some people don't be happy about that and some slowing me mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut ... says mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or not affiliated voters with his vote for Kavanaugh ... believes mansion has certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for cap and all that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington for NPR News I'm

to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this snake on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change\nThe Exxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why there's an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nFertile sin says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it or Republicans today to embrace any new tax difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect John Ydstie NPR News Washington this is NPR News\n[noise]\nStraight ahead on the marketplace morning report the expenses of getting sick with

anymore the corrupt to district attorney's office will just make no effort to break up organized crime so the governor of new\nWork for the New York yesterday attorney to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who've never been prosecutors who'd never been involved with the prosecutor's office which are seen as entirely corrupt so we hired ... what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that she became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen [noise]\nWe don't know exactly why you're hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate what was the ... but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a moral crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these companies are coming in they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says\nThere's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation but she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had that the mob was involved in prostitution because it was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out\nThan it was to keep the women and they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses will turn against their bosses have hope to only turn against a Louisiana enter everyone's surprise Unisys idea worked\nWow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana\nWere prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with\nWas a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Louisiana several times discussing with the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times let me interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer demanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony so cookie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice because Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team and Lucy on his team had no women so\nWas there when the doctors examine term returned to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict so how does learning\nThis story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America and the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to America now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores are talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history\nIs that there were people who are against all the odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves that there were people who built\nA society a with in the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as the Santa wonderful lives even at a time when so many evidence or close
