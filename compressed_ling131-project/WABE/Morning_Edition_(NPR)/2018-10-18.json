he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been a reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much\nMore powerful so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin some on can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be you know he came\nOn the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many ah in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with him so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as a man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ...\nPolitically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to ah see even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince as toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes\nIs that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on is\nAlright NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that thank you how\nMany calls today was the words of ... in his last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nAnd you're listening to MORNING EDITION of Ninety point one W.

important to remember that\nIf Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts to Saudi Arabia\nI'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at a broader scope of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia we are selling Saudi Arabia\nI'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat as Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thinks she center thank you\nDemocracy oh gee was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos dad has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first trip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us ... thank you what went through your mind as you rent this final column from ... in the Washington Post you know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave him this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you know so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia or Mohammad bin some on can you explain\nHis rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be [noise]\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many ah in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria a you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as a man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom\nAnd that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king sell them on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic to king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes\nIs that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on us\nAll right NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that\nThank you and we closed today with the words of ... ... in his last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence\nYou know as we were just listening to that I'm I'm Christine Dempsey diverse went with me and we both around in this the control room while the shows on but when you hear something like that it makes you stop and that's what NPR does
