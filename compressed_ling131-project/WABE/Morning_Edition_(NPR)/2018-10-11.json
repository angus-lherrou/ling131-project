complained about their reporting on Monday the paper published a story about government spending and no bid contracts by the local government which is headed by a political ally of me and Mars to factor leader on time to chain here's reporter Michael Sullivan\nTo senior editors and the papers chief reporter at eleven media were detained for violating section five oh five of me and Mars colonial Arab penal code which prohibits publishing information that may cause fear or alarmed to the public or disrupt public tranquility\nIt's hard to see how the newspaper story on public spending by the ongoing government fits either description\nCritics say it's the latest attempt by government officials to muzzle man most independent journalists\nWhat it indicates is that the Myanmar government sees the media as the enemy ... she's an independent press as a threat to the bill the national league for democracy to run the government as it wants when it wants without any sort of information provided to the public\nPhil Robertson is deputy Asia director for human rights watch\nThis is a situation frankly where people are using national security laws to shut down corruption investigation mean we're really going back to a time when the dictatorships of past military regimes controlled everything that people saw and heard an all signs that she should be ashamed at first\nThat she is just standing by while this is happening\nThe arrests game just a few weeks after two Reuters reporters were sentenced to seven years in prison for violating the official secrets act while investigating the massacre of twelve Muslim minority Rohingya\nThe trial which saw a police captain testified that the two journalists had been set up was widely condemned by the international community but also she defended the verdict at a recent world Economic Forum meeting in Vietnam\nWere not able to see like Janice ... because to call it has decided that they had woken deficiency ... so if we believe in the rule of law they have every right to a few of the the Jetsons\nFor any child fly adjustment is wrong if they consider wrong\nSo jaded element is becoming increasingly isolated because of the violent crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya by Myanmar's military which both of us and that you would have called ethnic cleansing are you in fact finding team last month recommended that Myanmar's military commander and other top officers be prosecuted on charges of genocide\nMyanmar continues to deny the allegations\nAnd sushi continue to ask the international community to be patient with our country as it tries to develop economically and make the transition to full democratic rule yesterday's arrest won't help their case for NPR News I'm Michael Sullivan in Chiang Rai Thailand\nPortugal has a rich history of exploring once on charted lands like Brazil and Africa but with that history comes the shame of the slave trade in Lisbon to separate public projects of slavery memorial and museum celebrating Portuguese exploration have become lightning rod for debate about the country's colonial past Jake's again or oh reports\n[noise] these gentle rolling wave once carried African slaves from listening\nTo the new world for a memorial recognizing Portugal's role in the colonial slave trade will be erected in a grassy square sets the way the memorial was approved in a public vote the controversy about the country's history a colonization and slavery still continues\nUm why were they trying to get him back and how were they trying to get him back\nUh yeah so as you said the U.S is gathered intelligence\nThat showed that the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will sequence of silence and ah he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with this this appearance and even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the\nIntelligence intercepts obviously under those assertions and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in its Campbell his disappearance at that conflict could in some way be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnapped him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nTo find that conflict road there is that there is this theory\nThat the what happened inside\nMay have been part of a uh\nA plan to capture that somehow withdraw so\nUS Senators have not figured something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find that out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is at the church does in the U.S are they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around Istanbul and uh they said that they will present their findings um\nWhen the time is right um but you know\nAll of this has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn gym but how about the details of the plot that they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... I think he's still not thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president's speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can ... says\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he was a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program ... here\nSo the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip that Trump made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico\nA traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated literally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mama been some of the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough\nFor Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and the same way that we've seen 'em ... increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran a ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly\nUm but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of this job um he was defending a lot of his friends your opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem\nFor the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes at war\nOr detained or in the rich Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong\nAnd again I just want you to North Korea I mean Trump expressing his love for Kim Jong il and was by far the most criminal behavior we've seen\nIn the hour we'll have us up their thanks so much for joining us you've heard them on NPR News\n[noise]\nStay with us in just about ten minutes won't take a look at the morning's business news the marketplace morning report is straight ahead but first there's a new box set of where recordings of Cuban music from the Nineteen fifties and sixties the five volume set is called the complete Cuban jam sessions\nWill take a look Anna listen straight ahead I'm Sam Whitehead thanks for joining us on member supportive Ninety point one W.

through the overnight hours at Cape Verde off through rush hour after hour\nAt well says metro Atlanta won't be breezy today with winds up to Fifteen miles an hour but the rain should move out as we move into the afternoon\nMeanwhile hundreds of thousands of Georgians are still without power this morning as Michael continues to move to the state Georgia EM sees reports a show outages are actually increasing their up to a hundred and sixty four thousand right now most of those in southwest and middle Georgia\nYou know it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spend so much time here at the hurricane center and and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls\nAnd like a Harvey right in Texas and you get a Florence that when they start they can they could bring\nAn amazing amount of rain flooding dangerous life threatening rain this one was fast so a different impact with a fast one is you know you start getting some of those hurricane force inland we had a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that and that causes a lot of damage as well the other part of this\nEquation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see 'em for five six seven days right when they when this time of your typical for October when they form in the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate so one once they form and they start moving and especially\nWhat what Michael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get your quick so those time large change based or were there for them\nYou don't have a lot of time to prepare are not as much as we mentioned the thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed toward the Carolinas um how much of a threat as opposed to cities still it's tough\nYou know looking at the right are you know we're still have a strong circulation around and we're still think of those were still a tropical storm or even after all the time for the ... corps\nSo around those rain band you can still get heavy rain flooding rain\nYou could get tornadoes in the brain brands on the other part that always worries me you know the falling trees as well because once you start to work out for all and we're still talking fifty ... that'll knock down trees and power lines so yeah but dangerous start over people still have to really watch why cause we we move across the Carolinas\nAll right

E. dot org\n\nSo once we get the basic line up so that was one of those things around\nThat's NPR's ... he and the rest of the newscast team have less than an hour before the next broadcast\nEveryday is kind of on the bottom crosses the times when we have two minutes not ten minutes or five minutes to make decisions when sometimes with my son just really quickly and that's part of the function of doing ... by for a news conference with the Louisiana Governor\nSo if there was no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think both sides have a very great interest in in a deal and then there's one thing that deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march\nBut before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven ... parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament\nAnd you have to translate it and process it so you would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nYears of traveling and going to like two dozen different languages besides ... says the a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that the I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken UK so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when he was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be and although the checkers deal is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward you know a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something concrete\nExactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and\nHow recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the took all the good friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the ... so if you think about the free movement of people are going to cross the border people being able to live where they want them all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when a when if if and when and if Northern Ireland is leaving a there is a real risk as to what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict a locally\n... 'cause we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and and the u._k. backing out of of bricks that if there were vote would you take Britain back\nThe EU is I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not the same members that that it was two years ago I think a lot of ...\nHas been broken during these negotiations a lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny um sadly or at a time and have to stop there are a lot of ... is a former diplomat who worked on the record negotiation thanks a lot\nThank you so much Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats taking a majority but they also have to defend plenty of states including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJail Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew Jersey of gave me the benefit of that [noise] I think\nJustice Department prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors Menendez escaped legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like knees started appearing on member\nBy Obama Justice department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper getting ten campaign contributions\nNew he deserves\nThat ad comes from and then this is opponent Republican Bob ... a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign\n... is a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Mendez earlier this year she can step down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based pharmaceutical company he touts cell gene as an example of a drug company that identified the patient need and satisfy to\nSell gene is an amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancer from a terminal diagnosis chronic disease but\nCritics say sell gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nHugo corporate greed won't find companies now ... about he said the more people needed drunk\nOr charge Cuban\nIs running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage he is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump and twenty sixteen\nIn a state where no Republican has been elected to the Senate since Nineteen Seventy two you might think you can support for Trump would tank his chances victory in fact to recent polls show Menendez in the lead\nBut two other public polls have Menendez and you get in a dead heat confirming what some Democrats had feared that Menendez is corruption trial even though it didn't end in a conviction is turning off voters bend working runs Rowan Institute for public policy and citizenship\nIf you're watching these ads you Bob and that this was convicted a and for some reason it's not in jail\nThe question is which Bob Menendez democratic voters will be thinking about when they show up to the polls the one who's skated on federal bribery charges or the one who will oppose president Donald Trump for NPR News I'm Joe Hernandez\nAnd later today on all things considered some people have been mailing away for their genetic information and then hosting it on line to\nTry to track down long lost relatives were story about why that is probably a very bad idea to listen to that after your smart speaker to play NPR\nOr ask for your local member station\n... in the audience\n\n[noise]\nUp in just about ten minutes we've got the marketplace morning report after eight months for his day in the markets yesterday it will take a look at how things are shaping up this morning at ...\nUnder ten minutes I'm Sam Whitehead thanks for joining us on member supported Ninety point one W.

E. dot org\nUh yeah so as you say the the us has gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears to confirm\nThat the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seeking asylum ... uh he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance them you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of\nThe intelligence intercepts obviously under those assertions\nAnd they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in its Campbell his disappearance at that conflict could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised that possibility or you know there there there's been very little hard evidence about what\nInside that conflict right there is that there is this theory that that what happened inside may have been part of a a\nPlan to capture that somehow withdraw so US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading\nThe investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks does at the U.S are they working together\nMe you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around Istanbul and uh they said that they will present their findings um\nAh when the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn jump how about the details of the plot that they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much\nAnd let's remember this morning how Havana founded back in the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties\n... ... ...\nMusic you're hearing here is part of a new box set that really captures the golden major afro Cuban music it contains five legendary albums featuring some of the finest musicians these recordings were made in the event of an art studios between Nineteen\nFifty six and Nineteen sixty four that's the period just before communist leader Fidel Castro nationalize the recording industry and since then these albums have become extremely hard to come by\nUntil now that is that is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volumes one through five and here to talk about it is Felix Contreras host of NPR's all Latino podcast ... David what's happening\nWill I'm enjoying the music there's very little Cuban music he claims that I don't do that well\nFirst of all the studio studio ...\nStudio in Cuba so that virtually every major Cuban artist had played at some point or another and these sessions or from after hours Jeff Sessions after the musicians played their gigs or places like the hotel ... and the really opulent Tropicana nightclubs\nThese are the best musicians gathered together to experiment with that mixture of afro Cuban music and\n... [noise] [noise]\nSo this was like the after our stuff yeah they pick up the shirts and the little jackets and they would just go into the room and just start playing and the owner of a studio rent tape the whole time sometimes between ten PM and\nFix them while 'til the sun would come up there you go so what happened exactly when Castro came to power okay eventually he nationalized the recording industry and the bureaucrats takeover right and the free wheeling bohemian themed suffered a little bit because the government felt there was a reflection of the decade or to the United states\nSo the owners of the studio were concerned about what was going to happen with the masters of what was going to happen to the style of music so they started taking be masters\nAnd smuggling them out of the country and depositing them in different Latin American countries along the way so what happened to those recordings over the years in hiding eventually they were sold at different labels in Latin America over the years some shoddy reproductions were produced along the way but most of the albums became incredibly hard to find\nSo finally a couple of years ago California label craft recordings Baucus Mexican label that was holding on to these tapes and they've figured out what they were holding\nAnd he decided to put something like this together [noise]\n[noise] ... what are some of the highlights what ends up okay there's one in particular that I call the crown jewel of the of the collection is called Jeff Sessions in miniature it's by the famous bases Israel Lopez for a child and you got to check the stuff because of the music is just [noise] sort of thing\n[noise]\nYeah\nIt's amazing that increase how we understand Cuban music in some way [noise]\nYou know with these sessions we're now in the room as these musicians are basically creating a new genre of Latin jazz a combination of afro Cuban rhythms like tractor trailer mumbling ... and the harmonic sophistication of jazz from the United states [noise]\nGhost concerns is host of NPR's ... thanks for telling the full stuff thank you very set new box set feel about it is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volume one [noise]\nThat's what you get when you listen to MORNING EDITION on W.

'cause we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote would you take Britain back\nThe ... I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not in the same members that that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot of China you described it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny um sadly or at a time and have to stop there are a lot of ... is a former diplomat who worked on the recommendation thanks a lot\nThank you so much Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of states including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew jersian [noise] gave me the benefit of doubts justice\nDepartment prosecutors have accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors Menendez survived legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit\nAnd it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like these started appear al Mendez was\nBy Obama Justice department we're taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper getting campaign contributions\nNew deserves\nThat ad comes from and then there's his opponent Republican Bob skewed in a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign you can as a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Mendez earlier this year she stepped down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based\nPharmaceutical company he touts cell gene as an example of a drug company that identified the patient need and satisfy to\nSell Gina's on amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancers from a terminal diagnosis to chronic disease but\nCritics say sell gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nHugo corporate greed looks like a drug company ... she's about he said the more people needed drugs more showering Cuban\nIs running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage he is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump and twenty sixteen\nIn a state where no Republican has been elected to the Senate since Nineteen Seventy two you might think you can support for Trump would tank his chances that victory in\nFact to recent polls show Menendez in the lead but two other public polls have Menendez and you get in a dead heat confirming what some Democrats had feared that Menendez is corruption trial even though it didn't end in a conviction is turning off voters bend working runs the rowing Institute for public policy and citizenship\nIf you're watching these ads you'd think Bob Menendez was convicted a and for some reason it's not in jail\nThe question is which Bob Menendez democratic voters will be thinking about when they show up to the polls the one who's skated on federal bribery charges weren't the one who will oppose president Donald Trump\nFor NPR News I'm Joe Hernandez\nAnd later today on all things considered some people have been mailing away for their genetic information and then they get on line to try to track down long lost relatives story about why that is probably in very bad idea\nTo listen to that after your smart speaker to play NPR\nOr ask for your local member station\nIt is NPR News\n\n\nStay with us just ahead on the marketplace morning report the markets took a tumble yesterday here in the U.S and around the world will check in on how things are looking as the market's open this morning that's up and under ten minutes on the marketplace burning report\nI'm Sam Whitehead thanks for joining us on member supported Ninety point one W.
