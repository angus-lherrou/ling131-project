F. L. dot edu\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Noel King good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nAnd the controversy on the outside of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and who doesn't one day she wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like that that raises hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David\n... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us\nAbout her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty or ... the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half\nHours in a three week period focusing on that this was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was feeling to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of a African American relations with police officer she of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial of many people saw that as a as discredited thinks she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalist ah\nOutraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability a black face\nYeah NBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be Madden ball exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American incurred uh of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect distorted and what we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces in t._v. news which is\nReally interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuser former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well NPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border in on the other side is a coon yeah I don't look\nDown to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph\nWaldo grow up they're going to be like some tea okay I really would be in a hot humid or you could also demand across into a ... a couple of times a week what takes it if\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and buy groceries over there\nAnd then to have sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail or she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight you can get it all because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\n[noise] what do you make of talk from President Trump when he says if he wants to build a wall that would\nDel Rio from Mexico ... ... ... ...\nSeparate ... married to walk that I'm thinking of anybody backing you what you can get through now to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nOf this rule which rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months up that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before anybody starts talking about the border wall the need to see it in this natural state people up north Dakota there's a war zone at her and it's actually not to me before we start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem with their perks sheriff's\nSubtle deserves much at all [noise]\nJust across this little yes it's even a river this looks like\nA week of increased the river and remember how many feet are we talking about\nHow we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner feet [noise]\nI mean that's a hard to swim across so a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road ...\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill it come to an air of giving them the same tour alike well he's just felt that our office he ah he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because you're Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though he didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration\nThe sure should've been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or if we were pulled everybody else was even the bones were blown\nThat up to the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table\nRejected can't just go to because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that won't\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras a sort of put in the physical structure because where you're going to put\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put people in Mexico are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nWhere are you going to put it [noise]\nMeanwhile people like Amanda year a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her\nBackyard as she did with us\nAnd just like that were in Mexico [noise]\nThe the exchange faces right here where the dollar exchange so this is how can we now we walked down the ...\nStreets filled with bars [noise]\nAnd stores selling all kinds of Mexican

I'm Noel King good morning the billionaire George Soros says one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week\nCirrhosis a hedge fund investor and philanthropist whose donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDuring SARS has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs are just surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wants to attack\nThat I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important norm politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary\nA so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of his finance or being his politics and their life and he left hungry at\nSeventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance you moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful\nStock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties the specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound losing to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when the person's right or the pound collapse or us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy are descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his ... he had a clear political confidence which was to build tourism so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but\nThe switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War\nThere once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on demographic get are disturbed courses that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked and the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is lowering the bar credit sort of star us and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in talked isn't just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as shattering you caught expanding Russian birth actually is for that to be a fool the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes figures are about where the donations go\nReally nice um but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in his mid term elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet Ogle ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out the sheer\nYou know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump two thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy\nFollowed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close for Democrats it's health care and climate change\nA notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address that\nSo that they prefer to roll back tax cuts rose okay entitlements and fears of medical ...\nAcross the Midwest it's grain harvest in time and this

counties will open polling places tomorrow and Sunday that book\nOne final week of early voting that kicks off this coming Monday turnout for early voting has been strong this year for some nine hundred and forty four thousand early votes cast that's according to Georgia votes which crunches state voter data\nEarly voting is November second election day is November sixth as always your county elections office has more information about poll locations and ours\nMeanwhile elections officials are encouraging voters to be precise in double check their responses when using Georgia's touch screen voting machines\nThat after sporadic complaints that individual machines are malfunctioning for example some voters said they press the name of one candidate but a different candidate was elected Cynthia Welch is the election supervisor in Rockville county\nAnytime that happened they immediately turn around and alert the election official if for some reason that did happen majority of the time the problem is a calibration issue\nUm what you're ... years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and Pecos took off so to cheat\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in the sex and money\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here in pick us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses not everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's\nFamilies who have been here for generations\nThe mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize it there are people who are being left behind\nAll the ... is the county attorney she is a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing\nHere we are [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door how are you sir [noise]\nI'm trying to get their bowed out for Beto O'Rourke [noise] okay thanks bye-bye\nBeto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... would have an uphill battle here\nPeople I knew um\nWho had been Democrats for years have now just [noise]\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nBetter because even if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of a new hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town [noise]\nSo what happened to the blue wave\nI mean the reason better work has gotten so much national media attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history a but you're not feeling it I'm not feeling\nWere filling up our DNC you cause the gas

New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't one day she wants to look like they interrupt for one day I I don't know how like outrageous not hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white Jesus was a white man to tell\nUs about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty at the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something impact making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWill for you and me it might be in that and bull exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any meat of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled this comment see something bigger\nAbout the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet that keeps her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nWe're a family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations\nAnd our house is just a five minute drive to the border in on the other side is a coon yeah I don't look down to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with them but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I Want them to come here the right way Amanda lives with

week what takes it if\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and my groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep coming at all because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says if he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\nIf I ... when they say separate ... there is a while to get on with anybody back and you went through you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there was a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nOf this rule which rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nBe Barbara ... for the [noise] we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the

that runs parallel to Mexico that's when the\nBefore the body starts talking about the border wall and you see it in this natural state people or more like ... and it's actually not to me before he started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes

not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even a Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district in heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill it come to an air of giving them the same tour like well he's just felt that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though he didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration\nThe shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or if we were over there everybody else was even the bones were blown\nThat up to the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table you can't you can't just go to because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very

voting machines in Georgia are malfunctioning\nA few voters have complained they touch the screen for one candidate but and opposing candidate was selected Cynthia Welch is the election supervisor in

direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration the\nObvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the

F.

be tightened bombs this week\nCirrhosis a hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDoors are as as a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nFor the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or does it surprise as me and the poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list or you know progressive leaders they wants to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important known\nFish and um spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics and life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from\nThat he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful\nStock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd win sources right a pound collapse or us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy are descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt began in his native Hungary and then in the east European countries where his finance ... had a clear political confidence which was to build a list and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but\nThe switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War\nThere once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is lowering the ... and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to says he just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expended rushing the birth actually is for them to be a fool the open society Institute He's very open about it he published a figure about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape\nWhat did you find this is Kate\nSo one of the things that we found is that you guys like Larry Nassar are are really good at winning your trust and you can hear some of that actually happening in a police tape he was taped during two different police interview there two years apart for both two different complaints\nMichigan State university police and in the first one you can hear him talking to this detective about this complaint that's coming against him\nTo lose to everybody's surprise or the ties joy is really would feel that I was doing his ultimate for\nYears you know it's going to be here that you feel bad and she feels\nThat way because I feel like this little June or really that far right and that's why I was offered a job for a while if I recall the right one of these seventh year\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really that shows you how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and how overwhelming on an individual level\nThat can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not\nGet sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and\nI teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything they can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put them back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of ... tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen uh another accuser has come forward this same her name is Rachel ... she also comes forward publicly and a a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police it's detective Andrea maneuvered and she definitely takes a different approach\nThat she is working ... name of his\nOwn goals you know that was in your review of the characters or would you mind if I voted for ... if I've temperature is not a huge pushing off her\nWell look I um\nI guess that's what so what you're just trying to me is very different than how she describes her straight\nAnd what is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest were the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an Fred comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint and Rachel has brought\nA lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records and so India believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on Nassau\nIt's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nThere was a arousal is is is very much because of for over a much larger world [noise] middle of a year and a Russian your own is\nActually you know I'm just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea I'm an for one of those and she talks about looking back at this interview is that she herself was kind of ensure why NASA are would have so much trouble answering such a simple\nQuestions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his and he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim or the very least sharing the victim out yeah well I mean\nFundamentally this is how guys like this operate as they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and he seems like just as great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans who are not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with who are family\nBut the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and
