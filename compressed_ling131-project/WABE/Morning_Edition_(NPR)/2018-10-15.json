used by more than two hundred thousand customers worldwide with email template that dragon drop email editor and twenty four seven customer service Morris campaign monitored dot com\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show that comes to shove filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd it it really is the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're probably global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the store to store but yes the I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with a well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's uh\nWhere we don't want to go when people game that up what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tears were taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer in and hopefully you know have people who have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid we obviously this is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean Cancun bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring\nHow does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can agree on how to work it out\nBasically what prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the issue for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or a stalemate\nSo what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion exactly what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult problem to solve\nAll though you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not and actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of our party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom\nAs it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say are they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch\nTheir our breakfast years who say that uh and and even prime minister may has said\nPassed a no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament is going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market or across the English Channel okay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens to the next day\nWell now we have to see if she'll even fly to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if there haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way you're not going to risk that again [laughter]\nSo where does still may and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union um and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London both political parties\nIn this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shutdown them other investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to set the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect their willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats take by narrow margins it will be divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for the loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty\nOr Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder\nMara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\n[noise]\nStay with us just to add on the marketplace morning afford that sweet the financial markets had their share of ups and downs to look at how this week is shaping up at ... in just under ten minutes I'm Sam Whitehead thanks for joining us on never supported Ninety point one W.
