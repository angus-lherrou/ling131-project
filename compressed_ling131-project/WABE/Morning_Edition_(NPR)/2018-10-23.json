Steve Inskeep much is at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he\nLeads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\n[noise] no I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one\nWe'll be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nOh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nChances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so much time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\nSo we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but\nThey haven't produced them in numbers that really sweating it changed the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia\nBack into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms to relocate over multiple stench of the government is very happy to go along with you that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you prove American security once we do to\n[noise] what do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] but I was gonna say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty and along the shores American interests because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we can go on them\nIt was more than capable not only playing catch up building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThere was another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and you say John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nI'm from the ministry Chavez office two years how they have figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me but if it goes away um we will be looking at a Russian program that was a even more than it has and we will be like we have to increase our own spent in our own planet\nJohn ... of the nuclear Crisis Group

Ron dissent is NPR's Greg Allen reports on the campaign waged after a hurricane and in the middle of the political hurricane that is the Trump era\nIt was a noontime rally on a weekday within three hundred people packed into a college auditorium in St Petersburg there to see Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was one of ... first campaign events after a hiatus well he said he recovered from hurricane Michael\nOne we said the day of the storm Ninety nine and a half percent of the people in my city had their power that\nThe recent hurricane in Tallahassee response to it just helped put to rest of the tax Republican mounted about his leadership during hurricane her me two years ago\nIn his campaign speeches Gillum outlines a series of mainstream democratic and progressive proposals he wants to expand Medicaid under the Affordable CARE Act he wants to increase the starting salary for teachers to fifty thousand dollars and he wants to almost double the minimum wage in Florida to Fifteen dollars an hour\nEverybody I Know what's there aren't enough where they can take care of themselves and their family and maybe take a vacation when we get out of a year and that shouldn't be too much to ask at the state of Florida\nIf Gillum wins he'd be Florida's first black governor and ... says she likes combs progressive ideas his humility and his charisma his re she says shouldn't be a factor\nI Lived in Virginia\nFor three years and I will tell you that Virginia is a very conservative state and we\nGovernor and it's nice for heaven's sake\nA big deal race has been part of the

and that's why I'm here I Want to meet him and hear more of what he has to say\nWell President Trump didn't actually choose decides to run his support has made all the difference the president's endorsement and his appearance at a rally with the centers in Tampa help boost the former congressman to an easy win in the primary\nSince then decide as has concentrated much of his campaign on attacking Gillum in his speeches dissenters calls Gillum a socialist an unfounded label Gillum rejects another line of attack by descent this has more substance\nAnd I'm the only one of the two of us who can credibly say he's not under FBI investigation for corruption or the FBI\nIs investigating city contracts with developers in Tallahassee including one with whom Gillum went on a vacation Costa Rica Gillum denies any wrongdoing and says the FBI told him he's not the focus of the investigation in his attacks\nYou said this is getting help from President Trump over the weekend the president tweeted that Gillum quote was one of the worst and most corrupt cities in the U.S the status picked up a theme against Gillum in a debate Sunday calling Tallahassee the most violent city in

in Pretoria Georgia Mm\nNext we have news of a side effect of booming cities where housing costs are soaring and people are priced out people who can't buy in are moving to smaller cities think about San Francisco and Oakland [noise]\nYou know or Manhattan and Hoboken New Jersey which is a little bit cheaper\nOver the past few decades that process has brought big change to Boston and the town's surrounding it and now a full hour west of Boston Worcester, Massachusetts is seeing its stock rise from W GBH radio and Boston Aaron Schachter reports on what could become a case study in urban growth\nA few years ago if you'd asked most people in Massachusetts their opinion of Worcester you'd likely get an answer like this one from Michelle ... so\nThere wasn't any place I'd ever come um made me nervous made me ...\nMy mother used to tell me all the time when I was a kid to stay away from ... it's not a nice place to be\nHad sunk into the psyche I think of the city that it wasn't gonna wasn't so bad that this was just our faith\nWas through city manager and we don't go to screw up here and points to Union Station as a symbol of whiskers booming industrial revolution at the turn of last century\nWell it's interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know party you and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news it's it's very hard language didn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom um\nBut the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to date punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party her party the conservatives are very concerned about a ... and other election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain out more independence from that you you're but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned who went out and protest and free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWhat they were talking about there is here with here's what they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when this vote was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations are what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United States Air dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reports\nNPR but he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all is because of this symbolic use being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed by the states he kept the caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\n... shells south Georgia varied a lot of money every year we have a far as I did not vote for us nothing\nHe's now warning those countries that he will start cutting off for substantially reducing foreign aid that was some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know you're safe for them to hear\nThat Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid will help\nMake the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to uh to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states is diverse by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nHistory the economics and fire you got completely interconnected shorts very much in the interest of the United states that developed an ... year that violence is reduced here because it's pushing people in situations of irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey the law well how about the president obeying the empowerment Control Act which president from with story or pounding money appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this is James Roberts of former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nWhere thousands of programs in the three countries and they could be reviewed not all of them are effective manner you're too small to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure them\nWhile Roberts would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in U.S interests to help these countries blue security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nAnd come up begin to solve all the problems of countries you have to be from private sector investment it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...

state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address what\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are actually going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their batch [noise]\nNo I don't have criticized the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electrical effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing we've\nRaised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else\nWho's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the laws as they had been written look at our constitution\nThey are um not only are the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO\nRussia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump and President Obama as President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing in Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out\nAnd John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple stands and the government is very happy to go along and pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I think John Bolton is going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interests because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go or a merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we've seen a lot of reporting is more than capable not only playing catch up but a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThere is another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start

thing\nSo am I right I mean when I think of soul food I often think of of stuff that might not be that\nHealthy fried chicken may be fried okra does are you giving us like a healthier version of soul food or so food misunderstood I mean I Know that fried chicken and your book should make that clear but got those fried chicken but they're more vegetables and fried chicken so ... what does it tell us about so I think\nThat it is misunderstood I think there's a small piece that people know a soul food when you\nGo to a soul food restaurant the people who own that restaurant again to give you those celebration dishes that are going to bring you in when you are around the table and people from the outside come into your home you're celebrating so of course you're going to have\nMac and cheese and some other pork chops and fried chicken and ribs and all of these things because that's what you do even in other cultures that's what you do\nSo I think that soul food that stuck there because this is what people are eating because they're celebrating and going to restaurants but people are having fried chicken every day because they couldn't kill the chickens they needed the eggs [noise]\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was you distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind us with a different losing your mind people okay [laughter] so [laughter] and black people um\nI think it's also the difference between a him and then they grow spiritual okay you know you're going to sing the same song but even as if you were doing a note like oh and then you have somebody like\nThose other notes that are being sung or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from\nSo that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say is a stains on it but it's a stay on it you know you're putting that heart and it is coming from some place deep in your soul that you are getting out and and just\nWanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's a nigger oh spiritual\n[noise] well speaking of of pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the self ah for this book and then one of the stuff you made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregations in itself it was the churches hundred Ninety ... birthday but this was also as so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on worshipers just over three years ago in interest in men's tragedy for for a whole country what what was\nThat experience like we had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration\nAnd it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nWay because you are like a ... of the famous celebrity chef right now I see I didn't care but the matrix that kids so it was like I'm trying to get this re pass food done and\nYou all are in the way of 'em but they had all of these pots going in and then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a tasks\nTo other people and it is serious it was really beautiful and it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also\nYou knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family\nAnd it was just a beautiful thing one\nMore recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about um hot water corn bridge this is not your average cornbread Carla this is something different\nRight it is not your average corn bread if you're not from the south of ... [laughter]\nPeople themselves you know exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly have much of corn bread and loved it but hot water or having a sort of what what what what what would I be doing with it if I tried to make this\nHot water cornbread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers\nBeing in those patio so she would make little over one is my mother makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it I mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the the larger things that you were learning about yourself through this project I must say that this was a personal journey but this book\nI set out to tell this story so that African Americans could\nAppreciate the food more and people outside of the community can understand what it is and and sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook this ... but also to look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines more I realize I was carrying a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and\nWhat it is but I had a chip on my shoulder into it come out sideways and it and you know uh and now it is just a love for this food\nAnd a deeper appreciation for\nOther cuisines ... love talking to your thank you for for coming back on and best of luck with the book thank you so much has just been such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs called the Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep\n\nOn the next closer look our mid term election coverage continues we'll hear from a critical ruble voters millennials who don't identify with either major political party\nAnd the Atlanta based future foundation and its mission to empower youth in metro Atlanta town through education health than life skills programs I'm Rose Scott closer look today at one one Ninety point one WABC [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] just ahead on the marketplace morning report a new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee built using public funds\nTook her some controversy activists made some demand for a benefit agreement with the local community that request play out as expected [noise] look at that story in under ten minutes on the marketplace morning report but first over eat the food delivery arm of the ride hailing company\nHas revolutionized the launch of online only restaurants super says it's helping restaurants grow\nBut it's a divisive issue in the food business a\nLot more on that straight ahead I'm Sam Whitehead thanks for joining us on member supported Ninety point one W.
