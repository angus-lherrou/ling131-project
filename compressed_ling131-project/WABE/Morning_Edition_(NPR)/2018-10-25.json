to have ... the crown prince who's the de facto router of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to them a while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime\nHe said that there would be a old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOver the issue of course because I saw it she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul and he stuck a very defiant ... saying that those who were trying to drive to sweats will not succeed not well I Am from prince not while my father is king\nI'm not well president of the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of ... they're all of those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia is that they thought through is under threat I think this was the message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference

C. U. R. has the story\nRural America can sometimes feel like a country apart thirty two years ago Ronald Reagan summed it up with this clip\nI've always felt the [noise] nine most terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help\nRural Americans since come across some even scarier words like opioid epidemic so what's\nYour average very serious problems particularly around the economy and all we are drug abuse that really work people\nAnd Robert Blendon at Harvard's th Chan School of public health says that of Thirteen hundred rude old surveyed by NPR fifty eight percent said their towns need outside help\nI think that's a surprise for a lot of people that there is a willingness by most NATO to reach out outside I'll\nTake the little town of bill in central Missouri there's a big struggle going on in the small town right now\nGabby Stanfield feisty compact woman pushing Seventy looks up from the front porch of the town of Fifteen hundred corralled by green rolling hills and foreign fuel and split by opposing view of outside involvement\nPeople wanting it to grow and wanting it to be the best they can be [noise] and people that would prefer that everyone back off and let them do what they want\nIt's pressing here because this town is struggling with the same issues plugging much of rural America\nMoney you you don't have a tax base anymore that you used to have the shoe factory\nIn bill a big employer and many local shops closed decades ago\nCareer options are scares some petty crimes go unpunished and like in much of rural America drug abuse is widespread\nEven though we're rural the idea that we're safe isn't really there anymore\nRoxy Murphy covers bill for the Mary's county advocate newspaper\nThere's no way that the community will be able to fix that drug problem by themselves in order to do that they would need more money and more resources that they don't have\nBut it's not like bills getting up and that's another thing that popped out in NPR's rural poll Robert Blendon says ... half of those surveyed say their community problems can be sold within five years\nIt is not all a world of hopelessness as many others are described as a great deal of them is that we can deal with these issues if we can get outside help\nAnd blended says that if those looking for outside help three out of five expected to come from government especially state governor [noise]\nProblem is state money is getting harder to come this is\nA used to be the ... road\n... standing on a grassy right of way cutting straight through ten where she says the state's once promised to build a major\nCrisis they like the people that\nTravel to go through ... could see so many possibilities for this\nTown growing by having people from out of the city coming in here and spending their money here and now and now\nWell the first was found Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered address to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan now the package that was intended for Britain was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nAre these two were address to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump\nSo officials are already talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWell in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there's no word on a possible suspect uh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we\nKnow that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida\nAre each package had six U.S Postal service stamps the one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages\nShe has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this\nAnd it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTen let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president been reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has a condemned or any acts\nOr threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nUm and in his rally speech last night\nUm he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he\nHas done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so\nRally was at an airport ... aircraft hangar in uh in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usually\nTrump rally accept it then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does that say well it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room at the White House um and he was um he was a self conscious about\nThat I sort of calling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip\nThe way you see how nice someday but it's just like how do you understand that [noise] we're all behaving very well [noise]\nAnd all the way we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear ah off and he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump\nAnd and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the person doesn't say anything directly about the people who were targeted to have any of them said anything yeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're features of his rallies as a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at\nAn event and she said that she is fine

general is essentially saying as you kept two sets of books\nTom ... the director of finance for the Institute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was and another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public\nThe allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interest political opportunism

fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou learning about I spent thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] well China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast China is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was

have ... the crown prince who's the de facto router of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to talk more while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime\nHe said that there would be a old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are\nThose who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because her so she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul\nAnd he stuck a very defiant notes saying that those who are trying to drive to sweats will not succeed not well I Am crown prince not while my father is king\nI Know well president of the gun is president of turkey and I think the context of ... they're all of those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia so they thought through is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWow well I mean it it sounds like it was a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were high profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is is that absence being felt\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of the media partnerships and some of the high profile speakers inside of the high profile pile of moderate says\nThat said that oh western business executives had just not the ones at the top of the organizations who have on the original building um I'll have to say that keeping quite so low key probably

manipulate her what was that seemed like free Robin\nThere's a lot of discussion around that remember where I live in which she asked\nMen and the decision behind saying yes to let him do that ... was

you hate that part of the industry\nAnd you also said you believe in second chances do you still feel that way about Hollywood writ large in about about Kevin Spacey\nUm yes I hate what the media does
