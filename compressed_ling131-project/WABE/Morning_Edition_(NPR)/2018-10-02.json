pro by the Minnesota attorney general Brian backs to Minnesota Public radio has more\nGiven the intense focus on assault delegations made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe Ellison situation is far from ideal for Democrats who want accusers taken at face value Congressman Ellison is deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and want a crowded primary from Minnesota attorney general just days after the abuse allegations surfaced\nHis ex girlfriend care Monaghan says he tried to pull her from a bed by her feet two years ago well swearing at her\nShe says she captured it on a cell phone video that she hasn't released\nIts not try to keep the people that they\nThat was Monaghan in August speaking to Minnesota Public radio about why putting out the footage cause more harm\nIt it's traumatizing everyone's family and for\nShe wouldn't turn the video over to the party contracted investigator either it was the main reason the lawyer examining the case called the abuse claim unsubstantiated\nAllison says there's no video because it didn't happen in a written statement he praised the investigator for a fair review and said he's ready to focus on more pressing issues last week he accused opponents of fix sitting on the claim for political gain\nEven though I uh never engaged in a domestic abuse um I think it is a very serious serious issue into simply politicized that I think is incredibly ... bad\nRepublican opponent Doug were low says the investigation is tainted because the law firm behind it worked extensively for the state Democratic

you can find respected prevalence in Christian and Muslim communities\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nBut you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know it's just between the just the thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's a but a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid sets and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality love it you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is\nOne of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling up the federal government has abandoned the neutrality for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union\nIn other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration\nUh on on climate change this is the latest\nFor one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is that California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce of phrase goes and so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local\nReally national or international I think that it's a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I think almost all the money they've also they they look in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or TNT will try to charge them extra blocks or content you know most people that majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the\nFood for an audience of to the floor of the the abroad been lobbying the Trump Administration before and so I'm not surprised from the states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school things which which I've\nBeen a pleasure [noise]\nHow much besides the title is really changing in the north American free trade agreement\nWants to prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom in wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists\nChad bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics he says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages\nAnd that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe next three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build up mobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...

in Hollywood the epicenter of where the ... in Indonesia James thank you so much for your reporting on this we appreciate it\nA coup frankly\nWhen California became the first state to abolish cash bail late this summer\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor like we'll be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punishes the poor turns out though the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform say the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney Jason ... dean would be excited about recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state\nNot draw demon fellow public service floors of long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system\nMassage your bank account often determines who gets out of redrawing custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end\nBut this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the race as system of mass incarceration they just expands in\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process now under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program\nAs part of his or her determination whether a suspect is a low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nBooting believes this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deepen the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded booting argues including compass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ten now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history or under this law\nProsecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to use the tension to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single\nDay the new\nDell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have race similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact of police stop search decaying arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan already knows that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nThat make it should also I I don't think they should read where people are ending\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide ballot initiative\nThat may put bail bondsman and an awkward de facto alliance with scores of progressive legal groups who said there'll be ready to challenge the law's constitutionality in court\nAs soon as it takes effect next year Eric Westervelt NPR News San

that investigation was paid for by\nThe Minnesota Democratic Party Republicans have called it a sham and called for a pro by the Minnesota attorney general Brian backs to Minnesota Public radio has more\nGiven the intense focus on assault delegations made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the Ellison situation is far from ideal for Democrats who want accusers taken at face value\nCongressman Ellison is deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and want a crowded primary from Minnesota attorney general just days after the abuse allegations surfaced\nHis ex

and for me\nShe wouldn't turn the video over to the party contracted investigator either it was the main reason the lawyer examining the case called the abuse claim unsubstantiated\nAllison says there's no video because it didn't happen in a written statement he praised the investigator for fair review and said he's ready to focus on more pressing issues last week he accused opponents of succeeding on the claim for political gain even though I uh\nNever engaged in domestic abuse um\nI think it is a very serious serious issue into simply politicized that I think is incredibly ... bad\nRepublican opponent Doug ... says the investigation is tainted because the law firm behind it worked extensively for the state Democratic Party known in Minnesota as the DFL\nPolitically motivated ... issue it was always going to include in favor of liberties endorsed candidate for attorney general\nPolls show ward though has a real shot it becoming the first Republican to win the

added up our city is often the only see Sarah nothing on [noise]\nAway from the spotlight you can find fortune tellers and even the most remote little towns and villages practiced seems to cross Lebanon strict religious divides too you can find respected plans in Christian and Muslim communities\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nI'm In about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the wire to my local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's what a California's argument will be\n[noise] what is the president this cat sat and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a very fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically a feeling gaps the federal government has abandoned that neutrality um\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states I feel differently Internet's that's our California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California go law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see at the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them one they've all said they they liken that neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people have vast majority Americans wanting to trial the law is it's sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to this law the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise] how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nOther things they knew U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital and intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the ... the largest union in the U.S [noise]\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the

anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically

this might be why some patients get uneasy\nI'd find it somewhat hypocritical when you have a the doctor is a male then that's very intimate but somehow and as a nurse I'm male\nAnd that's the problem

their gender role in in public\nSome women talked about being a tomboy others mentioned walking in male dominated fields and feeling harassed by co workers but men\nMen say things like ... I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's purse while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n[noise]\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing the familiar explanation is massage any or homophobia that is what Boston talked to she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age\nAre you a real man or they say man up\nBoston built on the inside and conducted a series of research experiments into why men behave the way they do hook inclusion\nMy collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself it's kind of conceptualize it as a more precarious status so manhood is something that hard to earn and easy to lose relative to womanhood\n\nManhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to do [noise] men feel pink shirts and pushes because the defending something fragile\nIn terms of\nWhy this would be the case or why would you have one sex essentially have more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries or why do women take that femininity for granted in ways that men do not take them asking ... for granted\nThat's a really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than women's is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will think what women will think what they themselves might think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it is to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert blonde when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion\nMy father in law who's a respiratory therapist\nSaid hey you know you should really look into nursing\nVon didn't immediately take his father in law's advice\nLike a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a a woman's job\nBut one did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard\nThat uptown has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses and us in the sheriffs were holding them down and ... and restraining and all that man is is this is pretty [laughter] the action the nurses were saying was pretty exciting for me\nYou know you think of nursing do you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nA bedside let me hold your hand\nAnd you see what it is realistically day to day\nFor me it was\nWhen it comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain why stereotypes are wrong [noise]\nBut Robin Williams lives and Jennifer ... experiments suggest a different solution and perhaps a more effective one [noise]\nStereotypes up powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves are powerful they shape how we see the world and how the world sees us but in the end [noise]\nThey're only stories stories we can rewrite them\nShankar Vedantam NPR News ...\nShakur is the host of NPR's hidden brain podcast and radio show you can hear more research about masculinity on the latest episode\nSupport for hidden brain comes from zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot US\nComing up later today on all things considered freelance workers also called contingent workers to rise up to a third of the U.
