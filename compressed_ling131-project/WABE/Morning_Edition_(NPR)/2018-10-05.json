Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nDidn't want to thank you for having me so let's note that you have had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what\nAre you know interviews with some of the really key witnesses including Dr ... the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other I wouldn't [noise] there is\nEvidence that should lead it should've been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance is why\nHow they'll let let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there is not a very large number of witnesses who ride the uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr ... the Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witness and information that actually pursued it is a great journalism NPR elite after they hear them in interviews\nThe FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly described as to who they could interview and how long they had and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is that contention that there is no hand of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in the interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eye witness than other leave it should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that\nJudge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicted and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation R U alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here are two important point first of all this report should be made public so\nYou and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention them making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was qualifying self dating arrogant\nAcrimonious threatening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways on math\nThe judge and showed us the real man\nWill have to stop the conversation there is so much to say I'm so if you will get to say it on the Senate floor this morning senator Blumenthal thanks very much\nThank you

need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community my concern is\nThat this hash tag cannot\nApply when a specific man is accused and some kind of ... investigation or life altering effects happened\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works [noise]\nSo what what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell\nWomen and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward but then also a but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like\nHow do you how do you handle that\nWell as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do\nA any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh\nIssues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings when someone says is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yep what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah and I think we can draw some\nConcerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law that ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been\nA a\nAn effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy [noise] a lot of missed justices have happened and systems had the\nPut in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you you're saying most justices I mean the the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this was something you have written a lot about ah when this was happening on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses you say but I'm just\n[noise] if you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should belief you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems\nAre based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you\nProtect the accused without sending a message to survivors but it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter]\nI don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nReluctantly came forward I think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process\nAnd there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were a distressed by the uh extreme\nAnger and aggressiveness a and partisan attacks Brett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men who've been through this process on campus\nTheir lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared\nA say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack\nAnd lawyers I've spoken to said if their clients had acted like this on campus they would have been ... found responsible for what they were used up\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic thank you so much for taking the time for us it's one of the really pleasure

Dakota a red state that President Trump carried easily in twenty sixteen NPR's Don Gonyea reports from Fargo\nThe question has been asked and asked again and again what will senator Heitkamp do turn on the local news any morning or evening in recent weeks and you'd likely CNN had paid for by a conservative outside group pressuring Heitkamp\nNow senator Heitkamp has actually stand with President judge Kavanaugh and all this was a national disgrace\nHeidi Heitkamp never forget how she but\nOn the same stations Heitkamp advertising stuck to other issues such as this one on tariffs and the

their timing and what she said\nThat she will oppose the nomination she said it's not a political decision\nYou know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you inject yourself and that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh\nHeitkamp cited concerns about Kavanaugh's past conduct and said his appearance that last week's hearing raised questions about his quote temperament honesty and impartiality\nAt a democratic campaign office in Fargo yesterday volunteers working

will be the straw that breaks the camel's back with a undecided voters\nKramer says she's an independent do actually voted for high Camp Six years ago but says she wants a senator who will be more supportive of President Trump and less in line with the national Democratic Party Heitkamp meanwhile is known as a skilled campaign or\nShe has a month to make her case to North Dakota voters Don Gonyea NPR News Fargo Mm\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning you thank you for having me so let's note that you have had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including the Occupy the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have and pursue lead that should have been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white water\nHeather ... let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride or who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI\nLeads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist that NPR pursue leads after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that the FBI with circular described as to who they could interview and how long they had and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they said there still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is that contention that there is no hand of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in this interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eyewitness than other lead that should've been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that\nJudge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicted and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there's solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here are two important point first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention now making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John ...\nEven yesterday the former Supreme Court said that his performance at the committee last Thursday qualify for getting arrogant acrimonious frightening I mean he brought to the court in many ways on math and showed us the real man\nWill have to stop the conversation there is so much to say an solve you will get to say it on the Senate for this morning senator Blumenthal thanks very much thank you that's Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut [noise]\nFirst lady Melania Trump has been touring the African continent she's

Romero of cake you weedy begins this report with a sign of just how troubling the conditions were\nI saw what they did to Robert Bork\nI saw what they did to Clarence Thomas that was nothing compared to what we witnessed here in the last three months the conduct of left wing dark money groups and their allies in this body have shamed us\nThe fact was in from the very beginning before the ink was even dry on the nomination the minority leader announced that he would oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he's got\nEven before he knew the president's nominee minority\nLeader said that he was opposed to all twenty five well qualified potential nominee listed by this president\nEven one member of my committee said that those who vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh would be quote unquote complicit in evil another member of the committee reveal the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats to hold the vacancy open\nFor two years if they defeated judge Kavanaugh and took control of the Senate in these midterm election [noise]\nI saw the most transferred\nI oversaw the most transfer confirmation process in Senate history based on the fact that more than five hundred thousand pages of judicial writing publications documents from judge Kavanaugh's executive branch service\nThis was on top of the three hundred and seven judicial opinions that he offered despite Democrats efforts to bury the committee and even more pay for the Senate Judiciary committee held a timely for day hearing on judge Kavanaugh's nomination last\nJudge Kavanaugh testified for more than thirty two hours over the course of the three days\nJudge Kavanaugh show the nation exactly why he deserved to be on the Supreme Court because of these qualifications judge Kavanaugh's antagonize is cutting land to punch on him\nDuring what was his three days of testimony\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa reviewing some of the recent history very painful and very well known to many Americans at this point\nAs we prepare for a vote on cloture ending debate\nOn the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and I want to go briefly to Kelsey Snell NPR's Kelsey Snell\nBecause she is at the United States Senate today and Kelsey I Want to back away from Chuck Grassley voice for a moment can you just paint a picture of us who's in there is there is there a big crowd of senators which is not always the case actually on the floor for the speech has\nNot yet we're not at that part of the day yet I'm this is kind of a quieter moment the Senate has just open and honest and you really only have one or two senators I'm ... and ... and a little gaggle of pages that the high school students who I spend about a semester here in the capital helping the senators out\nWe expect that people will start sheltering in and giving speeches and I will also seen many speeches that are part of the debate that comes after the cloture vote this ... this necessary procedural vote because some senators are saying that they're going to wait until after this procedural vote to tell us how they're going to vote on the final\nCount hello this is important let's underline this this is a vote to end debate\nYou can conceivably say yes I'm ready to end debate but I'm Still not going to vote for the nominee a vote today on the side of Kavanaugh does not guarantee that you would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle to fill that we're going to see and get less than an hour now once his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare\nAnd we are expecting some people including on you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final the which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedure hold up today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what were what\nYou can play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how the culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set applications can not normal and\nThat there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I had seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting just the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to a colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott a David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think I didn't find stand is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't quite there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years correct somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month and I just remember\nI remember that vaguely remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling a under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in\n... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be her let's\nGo back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nAssault even under the laws standard of proof she concluded quote\nA he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even more eager than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses easily suited her allegations or fail to reach corroborate there\nFor the reasons discuss all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee ... nor do I believe\nThis evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and the cold so\nWe have surly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leaves\nAnd at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "05"}
