biome is the millions of friendly microbes that live in our bodies Daniels a nurse she knows she sections have sky rocketed she also knows lots of diseases like asthma allergies obesity have spiked maybe partly because babies aren't getting their moms microbes during their birth when\nA baby is born through the ... canal and they get that first introduction of bacteria and it starts their immune system the C sections very sterile procedure you know they're not getting that first kicked in their immune system and it just made sense that it's a possibility that you know this spike in ...\nThis is linked to possible health issues with our kids Daniel heard about other moms trying bacterial baptisms on their own so she thought I Am a nurse my husband teaches high school biology\nI even told me and my maybe I can write well nobody had to know me has been would help me out but it's you know again I Try not to take a necessary read\nDanielle knows it could be dangerous babies could catch nasty infections by mistake so she was thrilled when she found out she could be part of the study the first study the food and Drug Administration is allowing to test whether this is safe and helps

the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap one of which obviously across from San Diego and that's a quite a bit a more distant\nOr with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... of the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined and size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself\n... nobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not was just based because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of food and uh\nObviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves how to they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in uh in uh\nIn a village what they'll do is they'll [noise] they'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly when which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not accepted I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here for three and the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably move their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person couldn't cross the border and just wanted to be closer to the U.S children or the others were ... were

in our lives that crude shape how we vote on November ...\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Margot\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with richer more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied\nBut it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I'll I you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're all those grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him and then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child and\nI told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe I planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds\nHe looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind it and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you you are saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely people\nDon't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and it it kind of hit the hit the mean enough in the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House\nYeah I I I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast and you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that\nToo and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to inspire the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to not these things down should fall to social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press tries to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in and understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and ... and ... even before that a but it it is really accelerated with social media and also I think uh the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning in our studios in Washington where we really appreciate it\nPolitical odds makers identified dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it's said could go either way and will determine which party wins the house this fall one of those seats is the second district

shift change at the verse so paper mill in Jay\nGoals in is a thirty six year old former marine who signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the SEA I'm very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk and voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still blink taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate pollock when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody way before\nI ask golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't\nView my role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with them and she does something her main I'm going to stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties and political action committee supporting them have\nDropped over eight million dollars into the district to independence in the race or not expected to be a factor but could be because of a wild card may now has ranked choice voting in federal elections mark brewer is a political science professor at the University of Maine\nIf you were to go and get your ballot um today and vote you would be you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates one through four one being your top choice in for being your last choice\nIf no candidate receives a majority the last place finisher is eliminated their votes would then go to whomever they eliminated candidates voters ranked as their second choice no one knows for certain how this will play out in public when has refused to say whether he'll honor the results should he lose\nBrian Naylor NPR News Lewiston, Maine [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\n[noise]\nJust ahead on the

E. S. so I Will tell you I haven't told many people about\nYet um they understand why people think oh my gosh that's so weird but I Know came with that I don't think it's yucky it's normal it's like real

biome is the millions of friendly microbes that live in our bodies Daniels a nurse she knows she sections have sky rocketed she also knows lots of diseases like asthma allergies obesity have spiked maybe partly because babies aren't getting their moms microbes during their birth when\nA baby is born through the canal and they get that first introduction of bacteria and it starts their immune system the C sections very sterile procedure you know they're not getting that first kicked in their immune system and it just made sense that it's a possibility that you know this spike in these

correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next morning Scott good morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today this was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team\nAnd we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of vapor where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president said there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get\nEighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and worked a job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking about sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a nascent\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of of having children\nWe should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens uh whether you can challenge that through an executive order is a is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nAnd that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try and scooter\n[laughter] he may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley\nBoth\nServices for the victims of the mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh begin today and that includes a service for two brothers for many in Pittsburgh Jewish

that could shape how we vote on November six\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions\nThe first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured he's back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with Rachel Martin\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem when I realized he was stealing from me I first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied that it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand\nAbout ... you know a lot you know buys I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on was there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're ... and his grandfather my father yeah because I was\nThe executor except that uh the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him\nAnd he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told her that and he cried and I think maybe that Senate seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's it's it's a process [noise] so\nIt's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nThere's so many different versions of my hope would be that everyone gets a shot to tell their version of a Muslim American story so it doesn't feel like oh this is the one will some show that needs to make it all going out of that\nWe had to the next location for taping in LA mosque is seen dance with racism black from sometimes space\nMuslim communities the character ... played by Geoffrey Maya is praying when her phone starts ringing with a song like this\nGuy to guy doing when you go to games\nThe director tells the other actors how to react and ladies look at her little shady in the next scene a woman school tests and assuming she's everything convert and tells her her prayer doesn't count with\nWe're less as everybody started wanting how Congress will Salafi\nIt's something that happens an immigrant Muslim assuming she knows better and it's one way the show explores identity\nAnd Easter break creators America days he says he's glad there are more projects involving Muslims but he says there isn't going to be one breakout moment but hopefully there will be many moments and the more stuff that's out there even the bad stuff the better\nDot dot is the flexibility under privileged but I think I'm white community thought is that they're allowed to fail in Hollywood and no one really ... but it's okay you can you can jump back up and here it was thrown millions of dollars a gallon for you to be your next project so that's the point but we have to go after\nIt's a struggle a lot of communities of color and minorities face in Hollywood\nThe two thousand Eighteen Hollywood diversity report from UCLA found that despite progress minorities are still under represented in key jobs from lead actors to directors to writers right now there's an appetite for shows about Muslims in part it's because some writers like our daisy who's written on Modern Family in outsourced or creating their own content\nAnd their support for it he got a grant from pop culture collaborative to create the series and some of the interest is Hollywood reacting to anti Muslim and anti immigrant sentiment from Donald Trump after he announced his candidacy in two thousand Fifteen the Hollywood barrel of them from public affairs council got a lot more popular\nThe phones were ringing off the hook\nThat sue a baby she leads to bureau in consults with studios in production companies on creating more authentic Muslim characters were\nUp against decades of storytelling that is inaccurate many times that is racist often and very stereotypical\nAmong the tropes women are chattel and don't have identities or Muslim only portrayed as the gas station owner or the taxi driver a lady says it's an uphill battle but today the list of characters on mainstream television is longer than she's ever seen\nA Muslim surgeon on Grey's Anatomy a superhero on D.C legends of tomorrow A L G ... Muslim on on the boat type a pork loving alcohol drinking Muslim on master of none\nWhen writers come to her for advice oh baby reminds them that the smoke from characters might be the only Muslim some people ever meet she tries to help them get the language right like scripts that use the term allow Akbar which means God is great\nSo you've seen many TV and film projects that have ... about being used in very violent scenes\nOr they didn't negotiates the studios to try to get them to change it translated or offset it with happy scenes like saying God is great at a wedding or a dinner party because for Muslims it's a beautiful phrase portrayed as ugly\nYou know so someone's hears a lot about it when they're dining out and all of a sudden you know they're calling nine one one because they think of family is doing something bad when all they're saying is God that was a damn good meal and ...\nAnd our babies excited by many of the projects now being written by and about Muslims for large audiences\nThere's ...
