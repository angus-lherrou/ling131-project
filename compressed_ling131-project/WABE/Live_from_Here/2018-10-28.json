collar and an upper lip and permanent snarl\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now is a studio musician he was lamenting about how the city has changed\nThere's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who are too strange to live in their hometown but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford and\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park\nRocco just a crazy mud and
