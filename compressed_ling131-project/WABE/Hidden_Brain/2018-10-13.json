about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how at the things about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first\nAt least book examines how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful skill ugly sometimes miss apply it we sometimes attribute intentioned allergy\nTo things that aren't even living especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes a name\nTrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina the mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America\nFor centuries people have described intention ... to natural force is we think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind of their own\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people there's a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people that something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain\nThe behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical an anomaly summer weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that this is why we're\nFascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable like you couldn't anticipate its actions\nSome people see so much significance and shed both days or even shed numbers into but days that they select dates were important demands based on those patterns\nMy birthday is I have a twenty seven and my first test on his birthday was September twenty and we had the opportunity to get married on August twenty seven and with a no brainer I mean is that it took me that\nThe

station\n[noise] is this hidden brain I'm Shankar Vietnam to [noise] in Greek mythology the hunter nauseous as was so enamored\nBy his own beauty then he fell in love with a reflection of himself modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of noxious is you know\nMost of us like people who remind us of our cells whether that's someone with the same name was someone with the same birthday [noise] most of the time such south love is amusing and homeless maybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem but there are times when falling in love with ourselves all the people who would remind us of\nOur cells can be a real problem [noise] read elements a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland\nThe study something called implicit equal to ...\nWhich is the idea that many biases or unconscious and one very well studied biased was he gets as some value in the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name so we originally\nLooked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry\nBut we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and I live now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples brick looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joy examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers miners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently the top two thousand names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families\nWe're in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both of names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations there's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that you did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand\nAlready over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them is looked at large data sets and public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans\nAnd he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as on communist you might think beyond what you might expect by chance\nThere's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of the ... as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nRead says that if you really love your birthday the effect gets even larger or operational\nDefinition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you weren't quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much and that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's not what he's really in trouble\nAnd my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but if you were born on April twentieth\nYou might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to rectify instead of a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable\nThat I myself had fallen prey to ... you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ...\nMy name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that would be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eagle to\nHis work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision at the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a ... affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
