behave like the starving men in Minnesota the poor people who are\nLacking financial resources\nFrom a very hard to think about anything but money or do we spend a lot of the resources a lot of their attention\nOn financial juggling\nStarvation make people upset super food poverty make people obsess over how they were going to make ends meet how to make it to next week\nWhat's in common in both cases of your head is busy with the thing you're going to have enough of\nThe two researchers found they were on to something maybe they thought the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity like tunneling in on the thing that's missing center says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective\nPicture that you have somebody from twenty five thousand years ago it was basically a hunter gatherer [noise] and who might need to do a variety of things such as you know get water do you know a lot of resources are needed when they get hungry as for the evolutionary sister who wants to have an alarm that says have\nReally focused on getting food into the system [noise] and that I think is the basic scarcity and the poor hungry and then this things started going off in the head thing do

wait a minute why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas\nThe answer to that question central and as I Believe has to do with what's Cassidy did to brandy she was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else\nThere is a technical term for this it's called bandwidth\nIf you're downloading a movie on your home life I find that you might find your email runs a little slower the movie is hogging all the available ... ... say our minds work exactly the same way if your mind is consumed with thoughts about something there isn't room to think about other stuff\nScarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have it doesn't leave room for anything else\nAs our says there's a simple way to demonstrate this you imagine trying to hold an eight digit number in your head\nAnd if I simply ask you to keep in mind you know to six or seven one six for that just leaves you with less able to attend to other stuff you use less well you'll pay attention to those things are so\nAs you're saying that they just now and now I I didn't hear the rest of us like they're trying to remember that how are you guys have your number one starts grounded [laughter] but then the sense that it's kind of a metaphor so when you were busy juggling resources worrying about you know how am I going to be for dinner and if they were going to be able to have money for school trip\nJust suck keeping an eye digit number in your head [noise] there's a reason\nOur minds with this way tunneling into something makes you focus on it everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside the\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals\nTube of toothpaste someone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the price was in a number and the prices and figure out if you took care of all you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rescue could homework do the of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward flat footed what happens\nAs a result people do voice the ... and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of thinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seemed to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone\nLess capable of that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect that poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding ... theory to excused irresponsible behavior and out in San Diego wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on that long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nAnd we found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich and to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly than farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\n... it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely\nBut they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn some days that we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave till one AM\n[laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and usually work\nEighty hours a week\nWe'll

business that or I wouldn't make mistakes that it's not clear educating me in quotes about ... helped me at all just makes life all the more complicated\nWhen people in poverty fail or make mistakes the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots\nThere was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes which is bad pilots center says a big reason add travelers become safer in recent decades is that there's been a shift in thinking about such mistakes\nDesigners have made cockpits fault tolerant rather than trying to find perfect pilots cockpits are not designed to account for human era the goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes\nIt's ironic that when we design cockpits the entire mantra fault tolerance seem so intuitive but when you design social policies nobody's out there talking about let's make this fault tolerant I mean you know poor people have a lot on their mind or band with tax they're going to make mistakes let's make sure this program as robust when they do make that mistake it's\nJust not the way we think if I offer a

it's hard to get get to class sometimes or other things are on their mind so let me designed this curriculum so that it's\nIn attendance tolerant even if somebody ... three days in the road to be able to come on the fourth day and still feel caught up in fact our training curriculum is often quite the opposite if you missed three days in a row it's an invitation to miss the fourth day you're not

several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] root discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients\nAnd they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nParent and welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that the average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children but\nThey're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financing the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes the wealth manager", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "06"}
