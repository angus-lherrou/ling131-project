I could see sort of saying\nThis is ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous to imagine that all these threats I basically around us we live in a relatively safe society and basically what John Stewart has communicating is you know what you're saying doesn't make any sense what you're saying is\nIt might not make sense to you but it makes sense you wind up here\nIn fact by you know one of the favorite things for conservatives to say about liberal says that they just don't get it meaning that you know they don't appreciate that it's a dangerous world and I think that is absolutely true but it's not that they don't get it because they're being ... up to ... uh or they're not informed\nUm they read about events in the world and they just don't respond to them and the same way and likewise ... liberals rather need to recognize that\nWhile this may seem silly and and you're right about John Stewart mocking us you know how can you uh you know live your life are worried and whatever but to them this is very real and a good citizen is the ... and is prepared to do battle to protect himself as family and society from those threats\nWhat what's interesting about both groups here is that there is a very powerful illusion that we have that the rest of the world sees the world the way that we see the world and if they come to a different conclusion that must be because they're being deliberately juice or somehow deliberately biased as opposed to the idea\nThat people are actually they might be seeing the world the same way but their reactions to the world might actually be very different\nYeah I'm really glad you brought that up a psychologist talked about false consensus so it turns out that if your favorite color as blue you're grossly overstate the percent of the population whose favorite color is\nA is blue so you know I think we need to recognize that we we did a study once as a substance and drops down and turned out that people smell it very differently just because our olfactory systems are structured differently some people smell it very favorably it smells like kind of cookies or a incense other smell it on favorably smell like\nA like sweat or even urine\nAnd some don't smell it at all and uh uh it's genetically based different so we we had a bunch of our graduate students smelled us and I remember one fella and he smelled it smelled awful to him\nAnd it didn't smell awful to many of the other graduate students and he was convinced that this was some kind of\nA psychological tricks that we were trying to get him to say well yeah it doesn't smell bad uh it was one of those studies when in fact he just couldn't believe that people would that different and the way they they smelled the substance I think the same thing applies to political beliefs and to the way we we experienced threats in the world\nI remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard the word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of auto disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here is Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nConstantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of ...\n... yeah I really think ah you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's really at the core of of who we are not the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us than it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense is if they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the ... of a legal considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently a positive\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct tents which is a common way of saying if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of him and just because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about that with all of a good look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to ... century too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rusty now goes right through their foot you're some at a sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you\n[noise]\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal\nAn identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins have\nSimilar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAt fraternal twins as a group that suggests that biology non environment is a driver\nI asked John what's such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard\nTwin design approach we did indeed uh find that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nIt did appear to many including Washington that the country might be falling apart\nSo if you look at what was going on this new nation just declared their independence and Seventeen Seventy six and so you know they were jubilant about having a one this a battle but it turns out that things sort of turn south fairly quickly\nAt the time the new nation was not he had governed by our constitution but by another document known as the articles of confederation\nAnd they really made the state's almost all powerful the states were were sovereign federal government existed but it was very week there was no president there was no Supreme Court just to Congress and the Congress had very limited power for example it could spend and it could borrow but it couldn't tax\nSo the federal government is suing into fault the economy falls into recession a condom is disagree about exactly how severe it was some say it was even worse than the great depression many say it was much less severe but in any case people at the time thought it was a pretty bad\nProblem so they're all these different things going on and that's why Washington is mortified beyond expression\nIn fact he goes on and he said that he was mortified beyond expression\nThat at the moment of our acknowledged independence we look ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of all year and so what he's saying is we ... we founded this country and it's falling apart\nSo as the state's ranking with one another and we're trying to figure out whether to actually have a workable federal government it turns out that the states come up with something of a compromise in terms of how to build the institutions of what today we think off as a modern federal government\nOne of the first debate was how do you build Congress the small states wanted a Congress that would represent them one vote per state so a state like Delaware or New Hampshire would want that but other states the large states wanted proportional representation representation according to the number of voters\nBut any case as they were trying to figure out how to set up Congress and they came up with an interest in compromise where they set up the house of representatives as is going to be organized by proportional representation and the Senate is going to be two votes per day\nBut what's particularly interesting about this is that I think often people think about compromise and we think can you hear this all the time today and we need to compromise we need to meet in the middle\nMeeting in the middle is one form of compromise that occurred sometimes but I think even more common I think in American history in dealing with the kind of conflict\nThat I see is that you don't meet in the middle you do sort of the best of both [laughter] so what you see is a small states got what they want it and the large they've got what they want and so instead of meeting in the middle are splitting the difference than they did vote\nFor the historic her mom and dad mortified Washington also resolved it in a model of government that doesn't do it for more than two centuries the conflict was painful but productive [noise]\nNearly one hundred years later the new nation was tested again\nThis time after the election of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nLet the consequences the what they may whether the Potomac prescription in human Gore Mitt surveying avenues pay can fathom death\nWith mangled body whether the last vestige of liberty is sweat in the face of the American continent the south never submit that humiliation and degradation of the moderation of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd it's on the newspaper and express what many were feeling in the country at the time [noise]\nSouthern states were starting to seat it was the eve of the civil war well the civil war brought ... to\nAn end David still things of this moment as an example of destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved to the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president of the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just a sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah at that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\nWondering if one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually\nWilling to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that in productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're willing to go\nAnd so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family writes a family we have every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down then actually the conflict convict the family [noise]\n\nAnd the
