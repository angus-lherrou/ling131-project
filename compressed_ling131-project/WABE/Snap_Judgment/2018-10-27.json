walking with me he stayed outside\nI was having that feeling that I needed to go forward inside the house and it the steps of falling apart [noise]\nSeal is collapse [noise] they'll forge a\nWobbly and they're making freaky sounds and building so on stage [noise] but when I get up the steps the way the light [noise]\nCame in from the ceiling sees the pitcher\n\nI knew I needed like\nThese are rollers he's rollers\nRollers of fear and I'm not afraid and more and not only are there are rollers\nLeave this couple and they ask ... baby\nI get the pitchers babies at all\nWhich was which was quite difficult uh trying to do\nBecause they were flapping like crazy and you know I'm twelve years old I'm trying to press them to my chest started cooing Adam [noise] which is something we went to I Try to calm down and at work and they stop trying to slap a struggle with me\n\nWhen I come outside of the house with the pages pressed against much as you know they're flapping going crazy I Want

debt [noise] having a a\nWorld paw wound on my hand was much harder to explain away\nMaybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation is that I just skin to the squirrel alive [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop\nIt felt like I was going to be heard from that point on to never have\nAnother good experience with taxidermy which would be devastating [noise]\nLike what if I'm done what if it's gonna be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out but if I had given up it would have been a huge step backwards\nI popped on a new glove clipped the wrists and the or ankles up the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt\nSo that it could dehydrate and put her on the shelf underneath my uh underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and\n[noise]\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was dropping and every time it ... I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up\nAnd all I have to do is change to solve\nCan't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday [noise]\nI took the big bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside the skin was sitting\nUp halfway out of the salt as if it did for road up for air like I saw him be getting up from its grave [noise]\n\nIt was just sitting there\nStaring at me with these empty island [noise]\nThe ties kind of\nSticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the dead holiday world pushed its way up to ten pounds so there was also no way that anybody has touched it because they all think it's disgusting [noise]\n\nI just dumped out the salt buried again put it on the shelf and\nWalked away from it for I expected it to be a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my coffee I heard a squirrel start barking [noise]\n\nAnd I for a second I throws because I'm thinking oh my God it's bits back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that\nI was\nSo afraid of it also used to nibble and Kate burn scanner and art and um [noise]\nMarrying nuts and oh it just kind of just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had I don't know dignity I went back to\nThe salt and uh you know the ...\nWas actually still in there it hadn't tried to escape again [noise] but I just opened it up\nI felt like I go to an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I\nDidn't listen because I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started\nThe only thing that I Want to do is preserve you and make you last forever\nSo the next morning I woke up\nAnd I walked out on the porch and looked up in the big oak tree that's right over the fence I saw a brown squirrels not medium size really bushy tailed with a white tip [noise]\n\nThe ... that was identical to the one I mean you know currently modifying under ten pounds of salt in a tub a few feet away from me\nHow common is that if it had like a a ... is there like snowflakes you know\n[noise]\nI just wanted to see what would happen so I took an own in between my Simon finger [noise] and I just\nHeld it out and\nSure enough the squirrel jumped from the tree onto the railing of my balcony and hopped along the railing until it got\nTo my hand maybe my hand was shaking like crazy this cultural sniff me so close that I felt it snows on my finger tip\n[noise] and then it grabs almonds\nIn its teeth [noise] turned around [noise] hopped over to the other end of the fence jumped to the tree [noise] climbed up back to that branch and looked at me again [noise]\nAnd we just made eye contact for another couple seconds [noise]\nAnd it just dashed back up into the tree [noise] it just it was like a disappeared before even reached the top of the branches\nSo I was just be completely re energized and I was ...
