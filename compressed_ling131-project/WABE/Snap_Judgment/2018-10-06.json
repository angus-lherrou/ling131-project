Charles Washington post and then I just moved on with my day\nCynthia the one who ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and ... relatives Dennis his knees on Facebook and message turn\nIn the messages since he apologized for getting in touch this way and then explain that she thought tennis is nice should know that ... might be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and\nMy daughter was off school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember laying in the ground and we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay [noise]\nCynthia didn't hear back from down is not the next day or the day after that or the day after that\nBut didn't they didn't stop thinking about him and then one day she heard back from his niece and she said\nThank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n[noise]\nI was just got it is the best way to describe it it's out it felt like someone had punched me in the stomach\nThat feeling lasted for days and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his but [noise] it's lingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reached out to establish\nThis connection and that that it hadn't worked out the way I'm Better movie version of it whatever down where I Would have somehow figured out a way to say um\n[noise]\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis was in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about Dennis his death like Cynthia dare I hadn't stopped wondering what happened to Dan is\nAs upsetting as it was ... when she and I were sort of talking about the timing and it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children all running over my house he was already dead this horrible\nToo but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would've made any difference I don't know why who cares whether it makes no difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it but you don't\n[noise] our lives are predicated on this kind of coal dust though right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night would it have made any difference [noise]\nWhen Cynthia talk to his ex wife cake out she found out the dentist always plan on doing that [noise]\nHe always said what he had said in the email when his work was done so does he\nHave a strange none of this or that all of a surprise to kick out [noise]\nGet emailed her to right before he killed himself he asked her not to be sad I'm happy to be sad [noise]\nAnd he went up to the roof of his hotel\nAnd he jumped [noise]\n\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months since that's happened\nBears some folks who say well you know could you have done more and ... were you being cold about it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything he specifically says that in part of the ladder\nUm he just wanted his ideas to survive [noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he denies and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of few strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook in blog up just in case someone got curious about\nHis work that was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that this was what was important and his wife\nAnd nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill themselves because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I\nI've been very fortunate to have had a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to see this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but\nIt would never occur to me that\nMy writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another hour and a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet and Hebrew literature and I'll say that\nWhen you study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um\n[noise] I just I was upset at the idea that what would matter most about a person's life would be their work every person has a legacy you may not know what your impact is and it may not be something that you can write on your tombstone\nUm but every person has an impact on this world who\nSo let's say you were successful writer and you published your books and people run them let's say you were an amazingly successful writer and people even read them after you were dead [noise] let's say you're really\nSuccessful and people read them a hundred years later I mean you know it's like well how far are we going here [noise]\nEventually you know they're going to find your name on a credit card in the landfill [noise]\nTheir Cynthia Enron all went back to their lives back to their kids their hobbies back to their writing none of them have taken an interest and Dennis is work\nSo dances worked just sits there in the back rooms of the Internet he does have one book on Amazon the one that got published although there isn't a lot of evidence that many people have visited his page it's pretty barren no authors bio no picture\nThe only clear evidence that anyone has read his book as a single solitary review\nAs positive five stars I got curious who wrote it so I emailed her the review it turns out was written\nBy his daughter [noise] she she she you know [noise]\nThe the\nBig things to some people today more Ron Charles ...
