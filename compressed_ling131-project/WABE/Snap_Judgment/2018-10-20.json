see how they were going to vote so if you're going to pay them a dollar to vote this way or that you had to make sure you knew um how they're actually gonna votes he had to see you had to have someone at the polling place watch them I put the put the vote and so there was a downside there was a corruption associated with the with the solar system\nBut unfortunately when we fix that we ended up taking the life out of voting and now most people do they vote they vote in a private booth and they make their decision they walk out maybe by a brownie to bake sale or something and that's about

really different this time [noise]\nI decided that you know is going to look around some of the upper floors so as I was walking around like the the second story I came into this one room that it was\nCompletely stripped bare simple meant\nMore I don't know what am I took some too but I turned to face the interior room [noise]\nSaw that the goal was pockmarked with bullet homes with around\nSo I was standing there\nLooking at these pockmarked wall it just seemed\nLike something wasn't right that these they weren't typical\nMy squad leader and showed me this like pencil trick you can insert like a pencil and into like small arms fire against a wall [noise] tell you like the direction of the fire it come from this being the second story I put the pin so\nInto the wall and it's very little to the ground just sticking in like [noise]\nIt meant that those\nShots had been fired straight across\nVery soon as I step that pencil and everything fell into place\nThis had to have been killed for him but they had to lined people up in here\nAnd just executed them and I just felt a little chief in my stomach [noise] standing in a kill house [noise]\nJust collapsed in on themselves don't really claustrophobic and I just needed to get the yeah the room\nIt seemed like there was a malign presence there [noise]\nThat was trying to get\nAnd it was totally inexplicable you have to imagine that all of\nThis is under the backdrop under the soundtrack of this just this before [noise]\nJust this ever present oral presidents\nThis feeling that you are feeling what what all the feeling that would that help the ball and it's like anxiety and\nThere's like a there's an under current of tension\nIt wasn't like we all huddled together in a circle enter trading this back and forth there was people would pair off with their best friend and be like do you would not believe what just happened nobody's going to talk about that because you're showing weakness I think that if one\nPerson were to stand up and be like goes kind of scary we would have written them apart [noise]\nSo we're left with all of this down time and so you have now like half a dozen twenty year old children and one of the number one pastimes on these as Katie's is looting someone is like hey there's a storage unit down first floor\nAnd that immediately became something that all of us jumped onto because it it gives\nYou a chance I guess like um to prove that you're not afraid to know goes to prove that you're not scared as soon\nAs that call goes out like yeah you know what yeah yeah yeah man all\nAll all route through these people that I Know business and it's almost like a an affront to whatever was there it was just like a a gated off a unit on the first floor and I walked\nOver there and he and I really am basically like a storage space I mean exactly like a storage space and there's just a very simple\nSymmetrical wrought iron gate on front [laughter]\nThose wrought iron gates are so loud that three of us walked up and got really low to the ground in just grab the gay on the bottom and just lift a quarter inch\nAnd then quietly walk backwards so that the gates not rubbing against the ground so that it wouldn't be allowed at all\nWe left the gate like prop all the way up\nSo at the about half a dozen of us go into this a storage unit [noise]\nUp turn tables chairs closing decoration silverware\nAll kinds of things it smells like dust\nBowl and it's pitch black\nAnd the only light in the storage area is coming from our little uh our little red tack light ... it's\nAlready like three layers of spooky like we couldn't even use our knowledge and the space are night vision goggles because it's so dark\nThere's so little ambient light and not really for looting anyways because uh you know you really want to yeah neither does there's an art to this portable practice [noise] the only sound is like a light wrestling I picked my way probably two thirds of the way back\nInto the storage unit\nI find this cardboard box with a couple of cheap little paintings in it one of just a like a pass or landscape for the creek in it says like oh these are going to look and facing in my room [noise]\nThen I turned after finding them immediately I turned to my left to show off my bounty\nWas just met with pitch darkness just I'm just blackness\n[noise]\nThere was no one else in the room I was completely\nAnd I didn't feel like I tunneled out on these paintings I mean this wasn't like the release it wasn't like I was you know just drinking in starry night

all of this furniture all the crap [noise]\nImmediately\nFeel like a lead and white in my stomach\nOh I just stay on my nerves ... with my paintings took them under my arm and started trying to quietly\nMove towards that gate [noise]\nI'm climbing over this death meticulously but the entire time I just want to run [noise]\nBy the time I got to the front gate I it really work myself up into the froth I was really terrified I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could [noise]\nAnd I get up there to the gate and the game is closed [noise] I get low\nAnd lift and start trying to push it open and it just feels like it's sealed like it's been like concrete it in place but I was not going to cry out\n[noise]\nI stood there waiting for a solid two to three minutes which probably doesn't sound like that long of a time but when you're sealed in a foreign space with like\nPitch blackness behind you and the weight of the entire missions security here in judging on you forcing
