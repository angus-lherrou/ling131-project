native peoples inhabited the president to United States for thousands of years before the arrival of people have European descent that they honored protecting the steward at this land we cherish\nAnd then it says whereas whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new chapter in history of native peoples and then it continues to whereas whereas whereas and whereas\n[laughter] so you discovered this and I'm asked what was your reaction\nI think well first of all what what motivated me to even respond to the apology was the delivery so that's the heart of it or I should say than non delivery of the apology yeah\nBut then I went online and I read the apology and then I was like oh my gosh the the language\nIt's so careful also carefully crafted onion oh my goodness these guys are poets like [laughter]\nI mean very astute in very aware\nOf what each phrase how how do we sit a you know what each phrase may carry yeah the implication of each phrase now so even the phrasing of um\nThe arrival of Europeans opened a new chapter yeah for native people\nThat's crazy it was an opening a new job [laughter] that's\nYeah that's almost poetry is very interesting way to to look at what happened right so and going further into the document\nUm [noise]\nYou know just the idea of for example um they never mentioned genocide right yeah things are phrased as conflicts um lives were taken on both sides and now you know the things like that\nBoth took innocent lives including women and children [noise] you know I mean they do say the infamous trail of tears and long walk but yeah you're right it's very fair and careful\nRight you know I mentioned this to group of students recently I'm at the University of Washington\nBut I'll mention here as well I was watching this really nice video I'm a little talk by face spotted eagle she's I'm ...\nAnd she was the only native woman to receive a boat from the electoral college in this last um two thousand celebrity Lexington yeah [laughter]\nAh she's an amazing um beautiful woman a wonderful speaker to [noise] um and so anyway I was watching the video this little talk she was giving and she was talking about the idea of discussing um history\nDiscussing some of these traumas that have happened yeah and she was saying\nFor native people\nTalking about these things it's important to process of healing uh-huh and for me I think it's not just feeling I Would add to that a sense of justice uh-huh you know being heard\nAnd then on the other hand she said for non native people hearing and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in a conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial uh-huh it allows a liberation\nSo I think that that's really um maybe\nWhat was important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back a hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years or I didn't want to jump back to ... or send creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right\nI'm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing um they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter] in them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but\nYou know I was a little embarrassed just because they didn't want to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um that\nIt's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I guess that is the world were raving\nI'm ... and this is on the day with the poet lately long soldier [noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter] I'm a\nYou know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it's not just that you're not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how when apologies are done well\nI mean in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write and I just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone give a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brand\nOf really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since here I mean there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote and the beginning at the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and uncles are in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from offensive\n... [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was really important deliberation knew this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a people in that part of your citizenship\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that is important but\nOn a national skill I mean it's also not just a personal apology\nSo there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national\nLevel there's a lot more that goes with it right um when I was writing this response or I started researching\nA lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies one of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada a\nFirst nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school do residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality\nThere is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pacing of that apology [noise] um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin\nBy honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do yeah\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or\nNational level\nI mean what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this or that it was signed on weekends and it's not read aloud there is no ceremony and there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it\nComplaining to one of my cousins my sister and he was saying oh it's hard to be called to all we do is pray pray pray all the time [laughter] so it's like\n[laughter] and I yeah I just got a kick out of that so [noise] you know it is is a very real thing yeah and so it is something that um I have really\nAppreciated in love and\nSeeing how that really um influenced every step that the community took I felt\nAnd it's something that I've heard from people who were who went up to Standing Rock it was why I think so many people had a good experience there because there was that prayer in that sense of connection that community um and and\nAll kinds of religious figures all kinds of religious leaders also gathering around with their prayers yeah\nUltimately yeah [laughter] I don't know how you feel\nAbout the language of like Native American spirituality but if I find a dangerous I worry about it being thrown around and\nYeah I mean is seeing actors and the thing yeah [noise]\nI mean listen the thing is is there are over five hundred and sixty\nFederally recognized tribes and that's just federally recognized there are many more that are not recognized\nWho are many of them right now are are seeking recognition but the point is is um all of us are different in all of us have um I'm beliefs and ways that are particular to who we are as a people\nSo you know ... to um beliefs are very different than let's say\nWhere I live here in the southwest from ... some of my friends from Santa Clara Pueblo let's say or Hopi friends or didn't ask friends you mean all of us are our traditions and\nWays are all so so different you know our stories and and they're also so connected to the land you know we come from there's there's not a separation it's connected yeah so\nNative American spirituality or just an awful term it yeah yeah yeah scary it is so broad and yeah\nYeah abstract yeah and it can be very very superficial and out of context right [noise]\nI think one of the most striking ... sentences that I've read or heard in the context of what's going on the Standing Rock as a ... one of The Elders are maybe the maybe the chief saying you know water\nIs not a resource it is a source of life mhm and that is a state matter of fact right I mean it's just we never it's not a way we\nSay it or think about it and it's such and in the whole drama really is such an interesting ah\n[noise] I mean it's so many things about in in you know and and if you look at that sentence it's I'm an amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand how something like what if water\nRight [laughter] and how a word like resource that gets thrown around and I throw it around all the time to like crazy it's like one of the big words now can dehumanize off and be away into\nInto belittling\nYeah I've sort of life [laughter] I yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like I have to oh constantly put out ... ... um before I ever talk on some of these issues because\nYou know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for for all local to people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert on any of these issues but it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship\nAnd seeing it in that way I mean even just for example\nOne of my friends posted something really funny on\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um to what was I think red will oh\nThis is the season for getting ready to ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more than you need and leave the plant\nAllow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year rate so it\nIs always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive is awareness right um\nSome guy living a sensibility huh of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer you are right something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right in the same place of course to water and a source of life [noise]\nI Wonder um you mentioned a ... a little while ago that you're that you do talk about your daughter a lot in in your poetry and I know that you know and I like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you were to read and and maybe this will like you were to use about because I'm not a ... year not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but but a single voice of integrity and searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in fact does not um [noise] there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be like how to\nMhm I I don't want to read that just the like the\n[noise] oh okay see let me find it OK\nOr maybe I'll read the first two they just kinda yeah OK yeah whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is\nThe last quarter there in the question what did I Know about being Lakota\nSignal panic blood rush my embarrassment what did I Know of our language like pieces would I teach her to be pieces\nUntil a friend comforted don't worry you and your daughter will learn together\nToday she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean in St to share a song in dinner her father's language\nTo sing she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch or be in multiple music\nAt a ceremony\nTo honor that didn't nations first poet laureate speaker explains that each people has been given their own language to reach with\nI understand reaching as\nActive emotion\nHe offers a prayer and introduction in heritage language [noise]\nI listen as they reach my eyes into my hands\nMy hands onto my lap\nAs the quiet page\nI hold my daughter in Iraq or doc\nTo the rise of other conversation\n\nOh oh\n[noise] oh\nOh [noise]\nOh my God this is on being today with the poet lately long filter\nO\nO\n\nQuestion I'm always kind of pursuing annoy each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and\nUm and I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there are some things you said about writing I find so intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now
