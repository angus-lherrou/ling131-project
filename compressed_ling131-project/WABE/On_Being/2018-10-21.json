NPR News in Washington\nWhat their favorite thing to do was and whether I'm ancestors were buried and in the course of going fishing with them a course really getting to know the em I came up with this idea of a deep story as a way of getting to emotion\nSo that was a phrase you used before that the deep story no narrative has felt\nRight such an important so how would you start to tell you though is that how would you start to tell the deep story a part time as you inhabited it well that experience\nWhen I came to a feel and ... is that um both the left and the right have different deep stories so what is a deep story a deep story is um [noise] what you feel about\nHi Lisa salient situation\nThat's very important to you you take the fat out of the deep story you take a moral precepts out of the deep story it's just what feels true and I think we all have deep stories what ever our politics\nOn but there are not a fully aware of some them their dream lake and ah are told through metaphor and the metaphor for the right wing deep story\nThat I describe it and strangers is that you're waiting in line\nFor the American dream that you feel you very much ... or if it's like\nA waiting in a pilgrimage and the light line isn't moving and has ... or fear tired you feel you're properly deserving of this role board that's a hat and the ideas you don't begrudge anyone right right okay this in this\nRight deep story don't begrudge anyone or not a hateful person but you see then the second moment of the right wing deep story somebody cutting head of you\nKnow why are they getting special treat and then in another moment\nOr the president of the country Brock Obama who should be tending fairly all waiters in line seems to be waving to the line cutters and he in fact is he a line cutter\nThe idea is okay how did his mother she's a single mother not a rich woman afford a Harvard education ... education something fishy that that was the thought there [noise]\nAnd so in final moment someone from the coasts someone highly educated someone from that so called elite turns around\nAnd a really close to the prize or they have the price but they turn around and look at the other two are waiting in line\nAnd said oh you backward southern ... educate to\nRace is a ... a homophobic red white and then that is the strange thing to that insult ah [noise] and then they felt like strangers in the early ...\nAnd they would say one man told me I live\nYour metaphor another one said you read my mind uh another one said no you have it wrong that the people are waiting line or paying for the line cutters and so that's why we're in a rage and others oh look we leave that line we succeed in getting another leader\nA so they gave you write for ... yeah\nBut you can see ... it's my effort to get at feeling yeah and how detached it can be come from fat ... [noise]\nYes and I think a lot about it and to me this comes through in you talking about um\nThe deep story cars and that and as you said the fact that facts and moral pre sects a rise out of ... actually take some now take them out or they move\nThem from it right about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a foul ... true yeah and when I went back and forth between Berkeley and and the people I came to know and really respect and\nThe other world of the south I'm\nSouth with with the ana I came to to realize that they were different truths and different truth\nSo there are fat so I Believe in the reality is yes the deep story and again the all have the story um it ... Powell certain facts that don't fit it and it invites other\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion or the whole ship\nYou in a stranger send their own\nUm take up what you call a key whole issue um\nTo kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics anytime the great paradox and um [noise] you know you point at this dynamic that\nIn the part of the country or in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and ... great pollution and great ... resistance to regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that would say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think right [noise] um partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the\nFederal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out it's the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I er and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know your Harold ... the state now it seems to come down on the little guy he\nKnows I should just take this by you if your motor boat league's little gas into the water the warden over at you up but if companies leak thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life here the state let's go\nDire that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are are so rich and powerful that they basically have a ball [laughter] the legislature and that was that the companies have outsourced the moral dirty work to the state\nSo they say oh pay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them ... ... I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies yeah to come in\nWith that public money yeah came from Texas\nI'm as aids and can make donations to the autumn on\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for that was you know they're looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed said like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend to feel like the state is your enemy [noise]\nYeah and there's ... you also describe this interesting dynamic that um\nThat again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious anybody out a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um you you had this chapter called the remembers\nAnd there is something where you you just it's just amazing ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks in federal offices and to know environmental us\nAnd it in in a way it kind of models kind of direct more an right they\nThat right [laughter] too kind to fool right just right All right that's right you do\nIt somebody said asked so after Charlottesville now that we've seen that\nYet how can you talk to these people and\nYeah and and I to me another great paradox that engaging difference which is you describe right as you said it's not about going in and saying change my mind I Want to be Republican right our I Want to join the dean already are for or expecting them to because engage with using you know I I Want to I Want to be at Berkeley why didn't [laughter]\nI'm see I didn't change our politics and what you said and and I think this is true and I know you've seen as a sociologist across all kinds of like meaningful encounter with different you said in in large me as a human being right\nRight it did it dead [laughter] and uh\nTo be able to imagine myself into a different heart [laughter] one man told me you know look we have\nSimilar mines and we have similar hearts but we have different soles\nI thought that was so interesting and so I said to him thank you for saying that um would you be a coal sociologist with me and figure out how to soldier different and he looked at me\nSo scratch just said well I'm not sure what I Do what you mean [laughter] oh yeah you know this empathy thing or another wonderful encounter\nA was with a gospel singer who was sitting across the table at a meeting of Republican women of southwest Louisiana and she said\nOh I Love Rush Limbaugh [noise] well I first thought oh my goodness [laughter] oh and then I thought wonderful I his chance for me to get\nHere so I said to her could we meet sometime this week for some sweet peas and and you can explain what you\nWhat you love Rush Limbaugh and she said yeah sure so the next day we're meeting for sweet tea is and she explains I rub love Rush Limbaugh because he hates seminar sees\nI thought oh my goodness oh ... so I ask what what is a feminine ... well it's a it's a feminist to you know done like children doesn't [laughter]\nWants men coke and uh\nShe goes on to our mental wacko ... is people that want to regulate us to death and\nAfter I'm asking her she stops me and says I'm you've told me that you uh come from all the other side is a is it hard for you\nTo listen to me and I told her actually it's not hard at all I have my alarm system off and you were I'm learning about you and you were doing is such a big favor to share your thoughts on like can't tell you a grateful I Am and then she says\nTake your alarm system off I Do that too she says\nI Do it with my kids ... hot parishioners and I thought you know okay we'll start with no yeah little common ground for\nMe in fact do that all the time because I was gonna say what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it's habit we have in in the other player I between at work right because you can't just blurted out well how you really feel about what someone said at every moment of a\nNo no they're rules about that there should be some kind of the ground rules socialist [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah one thing I can get really better at it than than we are so that's a great invitation yes doesn't mean that church ... pitch a leading see that's the misunderstand the ethics yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over a\nHunting not at all no ... none of them just means being emotionally intelligent you've developed a way\nOf talking um yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction you barrel on in there\nAnd ignore the competence and [noise]\nUh identities personally want to yeah just counterproductive it\nIs counterproductive and I sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points right that might be made I I Want to see you know do you want to be right in every moment you know what you want any part of a larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day in order to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know making its contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAbout [noise]\n[noise] I'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion highly hawk shield [noise]\nThroughout strangers in their own land in his time you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right and one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considers itself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh\nThat regulation that a lot of the things that are coming up people asked what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we get whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government mhm\nMhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done phew\nYou know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed some things didn't do okay let's figure that out let's get right back for public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or are they expecting too much of it what's the record so ah let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent in extreme or ... I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise]\nUm so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever hanging fruit right mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end do you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left gene you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued say ... you know if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and its provocative and Hemenway consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own\nExperience\nAnd what if you\nGrew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [laughter] um okay what if that have been your experience\nAnd what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "21"}
