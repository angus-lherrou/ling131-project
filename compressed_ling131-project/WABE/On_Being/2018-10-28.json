course all kinds of things came up but I really began to see\nThat I was not my mind I was not my body I was as things but I was also awareness\nI began to see the basic nature of the permanence of thoughts as they rise and fall away and\nStarted taking them less seriously it was really wonderful I felt much less dependent\nOn finding things outside\nAnd it gave me a kind of radical self confidence like I Belong to you're on the planet\nAnd [laughter] you know and that uh I Would be able to ah understand the basics of how it is all unfolding I Would say that it also gave me kind of face in the unfolding huh I like to use the word sane face that sort of felt like it felt like\nI had to face and actually the way things are and that that was okay\nMm\nI'm protected and this is on being\nToday with mirror like Bush her life is a lens on a fascinating story of our time Buddhist meditation made its way to the west and has moved into many realms of human endeavor also reviving contemplative practices in other traditions nearby Bush actually took a corporate mapped out of India from\nNineteen Seventy two to Nineteen eighty five\nWith our company called elimination it made it to name which silkscreen ... and other iconic spiritual symbols and made its fortune on the rainbow decals that became synonymous with the Vw beetle counter cultural American heyday\n\nYou know I hear you saying ... said you you had a new insight into your mind and into the world and you know does two things belong together but I feel like in your\nThinking and in the work you've done bringing contemplative practice back out to others you've had a very focused way of tending to\nThe intersection between those two things it seems to me that you know the world that has let's use that word unfolded\nIn these forty fifty years [noise]\nA big dynamic in it is these two strains of inner life fan out or action\nKind of find any other fit fully [laughter] and you know you you didn't realize that you are going to be part of this\nYou know you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids then kind of really importing put him back into the west is pretty amazing to think back on it and how that's how it\nIs I mean when I first came back I mean the idea [laughter] we were so marginalized ... to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise] uh we\nDidn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully\nAnd and share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJokes with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still have the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine\n[laughter] right [laughter] [laughter] so\nBut I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um\nOur lives in the west so first I started a business with my then husband John Bush and write was eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in women nations was integrating this sense [laughter]\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice ...\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah\nSo we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter] yeah\nSo I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the BCS and\nAnd at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nRight [noise] that is a chef that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicality is yeah this story of such and such ourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find\nThat language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take\n[noise] yeah\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide whether it was so man decided it was going to be bringing meditation and things that are posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talked and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there [laughter]\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could framing and a different way\nAnd so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself and then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress\nAction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all those years right right\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course\nSo let's talk about where like the rubber meets the road than [laughter]\nGet back down to the ... really level well like so I Want to talk about the ... have you done workplaces [noise] uh-huh and this is Google but it's other places as well and you've also worked I think with social activists yeah a lot [noise] well\nI just remembered this year the freshman at Amherst College had they all had to choose a three day orientation in their first week of school\nAnd out of four hundred entering students Seventy chose meditation and yoga so there's a big change and a half so I'm\nThe first day you know I was teaching them mindfulness and having them you know watch their breast which they had just arrived on\nCampus they were and they had like worked like fiends you know to be able to get ahead and do you arrive on campus yeah [laughter] yeah so I left a lot of space for I'd say I teach the practice and then I'd say\nSo any reflections on that any questions and there'll be dead silence [laughter] okay well practiced a little more and then I asked you know what he would make themselves vulnerable enough to ask her land right so I decided\nOh better change this around so I I'm sides it gives them a practice of mindfulness an object and I gave them each a leaf\nAnd they were to bring their awareness to the leaf and then as distractions arose let them go and bring your mind bacteria leaf\nSo we did that for five or ten minutes which is a long time to look you know usually you look at all leaving you say oh okay I thought All right and and I didn't really expect that anybody was gonna say anything [noise] so I left a couple of moments at the end nobody dead and then\nThis one football player in the back row raised his hand and he was he had become in my mind the person who most was kind of resisting right make him so vulnerable and anyway\nHe said can I say something and it like you said\nI Love my leaf [laughter] oh it was so beautiful yeah and then they all started talking about how you know what it was like to really look and look and look and\nIt just made me realize that you know it's so much easier to do the things that we've done what I Know that some\nChristian groups called crimes against creation\nWhen we're so out of touch with nature and um [noise] so ... that one moment like this kind of this window into what we need to remember in order to make the right decisions for the future\n[noise] it also um\nYou know sometimes I feel like we we hit the twenty first century and I I think of this has kind of spiritual technology right meditation and mindfulness and contemplation on ya yeah it's almost like we like we're discovering all these other technology and then we're kind of\nWaking up to the spiritual technology that we have just need to back to our census almost I mean I Wonder a lot about\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and whenever you know we're always we're always engaged with our phones that I'm I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do it All right\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look\nAround and I mean I Know there was bored I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students also we\nAt the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nFor their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter]\nRight well but okay so and you did not all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what'd you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type\nOut your email either a response or an initiating email\nAnd then you stop takes three deep brass follow your brass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then\nYou read the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever\nWe asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nIt was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go\nAnd um [noise] they all said that was radical me using and then one\nI said I did something really radical I said what he said I picked up the phone\n[laughter]\nRight [laughter] so\nYou know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful\nI wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activists I'm really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it ... mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd they lost a hundred and is there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's\nI mean we ... we laugh but it's yeah you know it's a date with lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28"}
