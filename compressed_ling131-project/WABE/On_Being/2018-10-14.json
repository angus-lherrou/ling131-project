E. dot org it's W. A. B. E. dot org thank you\nBut you also then set out to write this book um which it came out at the end of last year and a few thousand Seventeen when I think it's my closet cookbook they're all\nWhere they're at their house about yet there are rather see it as fast [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut you have to read a little while to\nGet to the cookbook um but it's led life lessons from a father to his children because what you also doing that but and I do want to say that you also have\nOur on record saying that if somebody pointed nibble at your head and said you have to either vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton you would have to choose the bullet yes so that's also who you are\nI Need to be aware of my contacts senator I'm I'm a non tax and in that\nIn this book you also said ear you start looking at at I Do think you know this that's reckoning like what how\nWhat have I done and his last year is that is on record is on the Internet that my kids are going to read one day and I want them to understand me and a greater ... and to me that's ... yeah yeah you know I\nI make my living on the Internet I'm very blessed I've had a TV and radio studio in my house or for years thanks to the Internet\nUm I initially got started as a writer on the Internet because I hated being a lawyer and\nI've increasingly become mindful of two things about the Internet one is that all of us myself included um we we can lose ourselves on the Internet and become our worst cells\nAnd then others want to define us by the worst thing we've done on the Internet or even if it was a decade ago in in probably the worst thing I've ever done ... on the Internet was a decade ago people still bring it up that you have no credibility because of this thing you did ten years ago\nAnd if none of us are allowed to move beyond the worst thing we've done there's no incentive for any of us to become a better person\nAnd I wanted to make sure my kids understood that the other thing and I think this is the most deeply disturbing thing about the Internet no one talks about in should\nIs it is allowed every single person in this room and all of us up here\nTo ignore our physical actual next door neighbor and become friends with the next door neighbor on Facebook\nI tell my kids are all the time and I mentioned this book that Jeremiah twenty nine seven says she the welfare of the city in which you're an exile for their you will find yourself Asian\nAnd I really do believe that means your local community\nThe all politics is local if you don't know about the homeless man under the bridge or that your next door neighbors chicken needs food uh you're not being a good member of the American community and my kids need to understand that they need to know their next door neighbor not just the people on the Internet\n\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being today at the University of Montana with conservative commentator Eric Ericson and progressive commentator Sally con\n\n\nThat kind of think that this phenomenon of trolls is like a\nLight is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that the anonymity and ending this embodied I'm\nOne of the interesting things you said you've done as he actually well he said he said he said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq than they had a very deep you speak humanizing latch yes um\nAnd I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy march and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is mean are uncivil or or cruel or unconscious um and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um\nAnd they're going through a real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this is one of the things they choose to do at that time but still um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful\nHow do we deal with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness\nWell the only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and read forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize no thanks but why would you then do it right in\nA sort of it has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this dehumanization\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't\nI don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with this Eric is I come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way\nTo say okay you know why I like let's try to do both of 'em but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other uh-huh and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many\nPeople in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal to say oh they're a game Trump supporters me that there's still a system there are so as long a full but can I hate them because they're so hateful I aged out of high\nEnd we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time mhm so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's intention to be good\nAnd assume I Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you like me\nIn spite of some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read in ... and ... and ... written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou actually call that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this which is that\nThe culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them [noise] so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yeah and um\nAnd the word goat was in it and yes I'd like to talk to much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and you know and it shouldn't be on ... asked Erick Erickson what us you know saying that this has to do with repairing\nCivil discourse you know in some words only made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I

for Fox News Erick Erickson as a conservative commentator who's also contributed to CNN\nI spoke with the two of them at the invitation of the University of Montana center named for Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage humility and respect across the partisan aisle in that you know most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies [noise]\nSince we recorded this conversation Sally and Eric had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who'd come expecting to be bored and instead or riveted they told me they had not witnessed or I imagined that a political conversation like this was possible\nMichael Marcel like Montana Public Radio's program director moderated a few questions from the standing room only audience\nHere's a question in a very particular kind of looking for practical answers to questions are particularly hopeful about this local ... talked about this person wonders if any of you have any practical tips for navigating political mine fields such as the\nPTA or the co-op or the block party\nOkay that's her life happens that's a great question yeah\nYou you know I I Will say that I I have commented more than once in the last few months that ah I I may give up politics for the pope but at some point and I was old city councilman\nI'm elected and it's worse than national bald local politics as far dirtier um people get mad at you in the grocery store 'cause their their garbage was collected\nUm the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle to wear this night began or just yeah don't\nShoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives\nUm a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do\nUm but you don't shoot motives\nTo the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background and we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or what not ... it may not be that they just want to a ... way to get their kid to hit it over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanted ... just getting out of a beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\n[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise] um I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological\nIt's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we that's quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day timeout Mexican cartels or\nWhatever our study is that\nYou know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after\nSchool programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then has a much more positive effect more broadly\nMm mhm [noise] actually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we have um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact uh\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let\nGround easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something\nIn life that if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen more integrity more personal integrity not hating I'm like what difference does it make and like the two of you have been in Europe both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and\nAnd Eric ... yeah you said some of them that we're paying your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\n\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it [laughter]\nBut it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like a\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels daily ... demand in some cases it's", "show_name": "On Being",
