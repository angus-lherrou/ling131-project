guess I'm speaking as someone who's\nReligious suggestion also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us do feel uncomfortable House bill that um you know the express a strong and here is that of Israel or its best religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you or how the school deals with it\nBut I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not typically\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um but our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly that find professors especially a friendly if\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's\nYou know I don't know we we felt we do tell kids they probably should need need to shut up you know\nAnd I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every just kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing yeah to pick\nTheir battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that and not\nThe not federal everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David common\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie or speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not and you can criticize any countries policies but often

that you can vote early is\nAbsentee in with a good excuse or those votes aren't necessarily going to be I counted until later if if it's close or will they will sorry I should correct myself they will all they will all be counted right right but they won't necessarily be counted on election day unless it's close\nUm however with a lot of these other states that they're counting them as they come in on their Web sites that you can go to and you can see the total is being updated regularly\nThere's another one of those reasons on election night to listen carefully to the coverage when they start giving returns because they will tell you state by state you know these are from the polls the early voting hasn't been routed yet there's Twenty one day period where they double check like it's it's different from place to place\nThat's right and the other thing to to keep in mind and maybe this is one of the questions are going to ask me but uh we expect in most cases especially at this point\nI when you look at the early voting numbers we expect to see a Republican advantage in those numbers a lot of Web sites have been looking at this and saying oh jeeze maybe the Democratic wave isn't coming because look the Republican numbers are a little bit stronger than the Democratic numbers but that's where you would expect to see with respect to mail votes and the earliest butters

H. M. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surgeon early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth\nSo a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an election just 'cause turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting is following those those national trends\nThere's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nA ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county near Kansas City uh they've had request for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how this Kansas handle voting early well\nIt depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are are you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who liked early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had to early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nUm that wealth and privilege or keep ordinary Americans with\nGood ideas out of Public Leadership and\nUm there's even a sense that the system itself is standing in the way of democratic participation and representation so there you know they're focused on a really the fundamentals of democracy and I think you know listening to what cliff said you kind of touched on that as well\nBrian ... reporters from your station spoke to folks were casting early ballots in Johnson county Kansas a suburb of Kansas City here is what you heard from Sondra Kennedy who was voting early\nI Am I what you would call I guess at conservative Christian [noise]\nI I just want to I just don't understand we're going [laughter] you know I just see that we're going down the wrong path\nWhen you have people coming to our country illegally I mean I have no problem with every ... some point I have no problem with that\nIt's just a a legal you know taking advantage of\nThe loop holes and taking advantage of\nThe freebies that you know I just don't think that's right even when it come here and then you work hard and you pay for everything yourself\nSun for Kennedy a an early voter in suburban Kansas City in Johnson county Brian do you get a sense that a one party or other is benefiting the most stores the most motivated for early voting I don't know if there's a a single party that's most motivated I mean when I look at the numbers surprisingly\nWhere the ... there are more Republicans that have have done early voting but that would be expected in a in a state like Kansas that has more Republicans and Democrats but the number of the difference between them isn't as large as you would expect which which is quite interesting ah but they're they're they're definitely have been more Republicans that have turned out for early voting than than Democrats at this point\nWill continue in just a moment with Brian Grumman of cam you W public radio in Wichita Michael do you want to have to UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Michigan Radio's elite Clark will emails you haven't mentioned the millions of Americans with disabilities early voting can make a huge difference for this population

what would you say the trucks call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking of that proposal to which is a redistricting as he checked said and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the
