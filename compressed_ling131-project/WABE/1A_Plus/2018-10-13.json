political journalists Todd's will lick reporter Shane Harris of Washington Post and lose your Molly of securities California report before we move on from the weather and climate really there was one more thing you want to jump\nYeah I just wanted to lead to mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to tax uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business California's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality\nBy twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the\nIPC set forth it's kind of crazy until you do it real and California is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose it a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point not my kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise]\nLeary tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck\nThis storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nBut as he plays all risk of living within yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town could own incorporate it's it's it's a tough one\nReally tough and when we're we're we're we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastal into when we're talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices\nAbout survive ability about resilience but whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take for that also has to give people some agency and but I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict it means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death\nBut America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going what your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA\nIs meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nAnd this is something that here in California US Senator Kamala Harris and is out front on talking about it um and she's actually the first person can back Senator Sanders on this last year at least publicly newsstand I gather news English running for governor\nAnd on the Democratic ticket and mediate Lee took to Twitter to strike down at Trump's add comments to end the ... at the ad and he talked about Trump's support for the Graham Cassidy bill which would have allowed insurance to charge more\nFor preexisting conditions this is absolutely something that gathering incentives running and he wants to government run health care system and Trump actually called him out in Montana\nA couple of weeks ago I messed saying not only does news that wind chat universal healthcare he also wants it to apply to undocumented immigrants had kept trying jokes you may even move here to California to get their free health care\nOr story would like to start getting into before we have to pause and that has to do with the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh Houston from Saturday any fifty to forty eight Senate vote sworn in as a justice over the weekend and on Monday in a ceremonial swearing in with the justice his family by his son listen\n\n\nMore to the swearing in ceremony for the newest Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh his confirmation to the Supreme Court comes after a month long battle between Democrats and Republicans over that nomination we'd like to talk more about how\nConfirmation has resonated across the country and frankly whether this fight is over some senators are vowing to continue that fight against Kavanaugh so what would be their next move\nWill get into that and we continue our conversation with political journalist Todd's will like Shane Harris intelligence and national security reporter for the Washington Post and little Molly co host and correspondent of the California report here at ...\nBrian in Bartlett New Hampshire writes does it strike anyone else's

the friday news roundup was lowly Molly Shane Harris and Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation go\nSeems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to say\nA bit the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging Republican and a red state actually ...\nHad a chance of surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable uh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them\nUp but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh\nNecessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power a but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps\nWhether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control\nThe Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a shame said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nOr the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on ... face to face\nOn how much intervention did the White House do and that's sad supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection you think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night with trying to take the fight from you know on the ... thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real ... side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt ... really breaking French tradition by not getting the home state senators any say in these tax\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics for the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch with the thought of I don't want to say I
