{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "And they said we know you haven't done any of those things are you willing to go and I'm a Texan might have been a day that was friday and I left on Thursday when you are the two thousand eleven I'm baby girl as a year and some change old I had breast milk in the freezer [noise]\nUm but it felt like the right thing that the idea that there was nobody spoke to me\nYou go to Sudan I did on ... and then what do you see when you arrive\nOh there was so many things that were unfamiliar I had never been anywhere ahead\nAnd had never been across the Atlantic ocean we didn't go camping I didn't know any of that stuff I mean I\nI was I was lost in terms of the culture and let him a life of in this kind of work\nUm but what is true across the world is as soon as I get to the place of the patients are I Know exactly where I Am because you're a doctor yet I can I can do no matter where you go [laughter] big bellies and and wailing in the distance that that's where I feel comfortable that's my that's where I Belong\nAnd then your second tour I ... that that's like that's a that's not the word you know [laughter] but your your second [noise]\nYeah so the second time I'm the first time was you know special 'cause at first but it was also because Sudan and South Sudan were scheduled to succeed so they were I was there for a new country being born and I felt connected to the people there and and the [noise]\nThe other staff that were there I felt like I I could come back and help out if they needed me but I hadn't you know this is a bucket list thing right I'm going to go to doctors up orders\nBut it spoke to me it felt the opposite of the questions I had at home like am I supposed to be here is this worth ... this week I had in store for me and all of that was gone and I'll say oh this is exactly where I'm supposed to be exactly what I'm supposed to be doing\nAnd then as I mentioned coming into the segment you know often you all are in in areas where there's conflict or there's been conflict arguing Mr the conflict very much obviously extreme poverty in you know sometimes politics gets in the way how did you maneuver through all that or you just focus on what you do as a doctor\nThat the political arena is is part of why I joined Doctors Without borders because it's a level playing field it doesn't matter whose team you're on who started it who broke the ceasefire\nThat is irrelevant and I think it makes it easier to do what I Do like the next patient needs me and this is what I Do and it doesn't matter where they came from or what uniform there where\nHere in this country you are used to having everything that you need in terms of physician you've got to be the OBGYN you'd have everything that you need all the instruments from the table to everything but when you're halfway around the globe do they make sure you have as best as possible everything that you need and I'm sure that that can be challenging to\nI Am a particular surgeon my mother was a scrub nurse so I I Know what I like and and I don't I don't make any bones about making that clear but each and every time that I needed something special or injure kid or specialize it was available and I I appreciate that as\nYou know I'm On the board and I'm I'm I'm part of Doctors Without borders on a global fashion that I you know not just a search insist really making sure that we're doing right by people across the world and that is where I Begin I feel like if I go into the or and what I needed there than we are doing this thing right\nAnd you you've completed for search gold and I'm five\nNow yeah five ... man who was the last ... last one was South Sudan itself so um this new country has you know needs of its own and and things have changed since I was first there but the patients don't change their mommies worried about their babies that never change never change them not to go\nWith this new interactive exhibit in\nTour we hope people will get out and you're also considered a guy so take me through what what are you doing here\nThe idea is I Would say it's a chance for us to tell those stories that won't be heard otherwise part of Doctors Without borders is this idea in French it's called ... guys who are fringe organization and they were different in that\nYou can't just come home and go back to your regular life there's just an obligation there is a is an impetus to tell stories\nInfringe it means to bear witness to testify really so this is our version of that this is when people say if you see something that's not right say something and this is an amalgamation of all of our stories like we come back and when we're together\nWe share the stories that are painful and an extraordinary [noise]\nWe want it to be able to share that with people who who don't aren't as close to the refugee crisis they don't know anybody who's going through this but we say you don't you don't know people who are refugees but you remember house fires back in the seventies and eighties\nWe got our closer together my mom made us find pictures with that person kid and it because they wouldn't have any they were lost in the fire\nAll of those networks are very similar except that they're gone in a civil war that people don't have their neighbors and friends to rely on they don't have a way to get to the hospital when they're very very ill so that part of it is\nThat's the part that universal that you that you see it it looks different in another language it sounds different\nAnd the images that we might see in news reports of what we might hear on NPR oh the b._b._c. is one\nThing but this interactive exhibits sort of it takes to visit or\nThe person through all of this through your lives yeah and you all are telling the story\nRight so we start with the patients that ... where where can we be somewhere that they can get to us so we talk about the logistics of\nWhere is here where can we get clean water well how can we get medicines that have to be under you know Seventy degrees Fahrenheit at all times\nHow do we make sure that the vaccines get hit on time that we have bandages and suture and all of those things so that the exhibit is a great way to see this crisis through our eyes the things that are familiar to us the setting up the breaking down to finding the patients and and in so doing we get a chance to tell their story\nIs it selfish to ask how do you all\nBallots how do you all cold because you're seeing some extra listen we see extreme poverty here in this country but you all are also seen extreme poverty on another level with a whole lot of other issues tied to it how do you balance that\nWe have each other I think and and that comes across when you're at the exhibit you realize it at any time I could raise my voice and three people will turn to see what I mean because we are used to being a team and in the field there is no nobody is at all concerned\nAbout my academic credentials sometimes what they needed somebody who can run to the limbic fast and that part of it is is is where you'll also find your your nurturing and you're carrying because people people know how hard it is I\nTalked to ... you and I guess I imagine that maybe you've had to do was lost to [noise]\nYeah that's the thing that comes with being an obstetrician when it's good it's good oh man there's nothing like stealing that first kiss from a newborn there's nothing like it when it's bad if it's a it's equal the awful\nI met my first maternal death was in Sudan and it had never happened had been around ... you know ... in the hospital I knew a lady who you know what I mean but not\nIn my arms in my hand and I didn't know what to do I didn't know what to do it all I had never happened that don't speak the language and culturally speaking almost entirely unprepared for and how it goes so that part I mean it's hard but we have each other\nThis exhibit is uh the Georgia wrote Congress center yes the west plaza park yeah right outside of buildings to see\nWhat do you want people to know about this exhibited and encourage him to take it's free and his friends do y'all y'all liked it what do you want people to know about this\nUm this is this is a chance for\n\nAtlanta and to see what is missing in the talk ... ... what's on television and in papers is different than looking a person in their face who is terrified about losing their baby\nAnd that never changes but they have no hospital nearby so I've I've had patients that have thought were\nYou in labor bleeding leading leading it but because she was sitting it crisscross apple thought it was her feet that were bleeding she had walked through the little that far pregnant with her other little baby with her and I'm like man I\nKnow how hard I can fight for my children I Know I Will but seeing someone who's who's only goal is to get to the hospital\nAnd ... I'm always amazed and I'm always in encouraged by motherhood because this is this is the same everywhere [noise]\nTalk to Africa Stewart and thank you for each do thank you for your work and in Atlanta based OBGYN insurgent who was competed for ... and Africa she's with Doctors Without borders that interactive exhibits you often chicken ... thank you so much for coming in then and I think if we said it [noise]\nAnd that's it for this or just a closer look you can always find any part of the program that you missed on line at W.

listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson this summer the Supreme Court ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called this unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can be reached to collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue state solve this decision coming in preemptively passed legislation to protect unions from high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a case from a visual arts teacher\nSarah there was one more thing I didn't want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things of union negotiations for us on a ... salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers would you\nSend your that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition in the future market and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that\nFirst off I've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done the one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe Indian is not just your union leaders ... are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand and you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices\nUm it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what Indians has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that so important is because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are I'm not evaded and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our community is ...\nYou know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it up hey are just about health care it's not at not just about that it's about improving conditions for students for\nTeachers for families and for working people in general and I stayed with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting interests outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for us thanks very much thank you\nWithout a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually negotiating just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nConnie thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Vincent for a new show I'd love to get your reaction to what tiny said\nHey listen I'm you know we support union members and um you know believe that obviously when you're talking about bus drivers school bus drivers are public employees that it is if the taxpayers it's the children and the police themselves that we have to focus on\nI'm going back to a you know something that Randy was talking about about the funders I mean these false and exaggerated on having um attacks are designed to undermine education effort education efforts aimed at the exact people that county was talking about\nUm like Scott was talking about before you know there have been bills introduced in past in states around the country\nTo circumvent the rights that were bestowed from the ... decision and trap public employees into paying unions even if they don't want to where they disagree with the unions\nPolitics I just want ... because I Know we're coming up on a break it sounds like honey was saying that union members from her perspective just do better work\nWell that I think that's a matter of perspective union member a non union member I Believe all public employees care about especially those in the teaching profession or those taking care of children care about those children so when said union member or not um cares more than let's say non union member\nI Do want to give Randy a chance to jump in when we continue our conversation\nRandi Weingarten of the American federation of teachers which in her new show of the Mackinac Center for public policy Scott Greenberger of state line and we'll get to some more of your

U.S President Trump is threatening to close down the southern us border he also claimed with no evidence that people who are Middle Eastern are also traveling with the migrants\nReporters there not

hour will is expected to storm the shore and crossover Mexico the remnants are expected to drenched southern Texas\nIt would be a wonderful idea to open it up to all countries around the world and I thought we could get a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty signatures had that happen I think the Chinese would have come in at that time but it is absolutely right that today that would be a very good approach say they were prohibited from\nThis certain range of nuclear weapons the Russians are prohibited from the super this certain range and the Chinese should join us in that at least it puts pressure on them or to get\nInto the treaty and if they don't do it then it gives you some reason although not a very good one for some reason to uh eventually get out of the treaty it's a good reason to get out of the treaty if you have a program that you want to\nUm deploy a new uh some kind of device you wanted deployed to protect the country if you venture interests there's prohibited by the treaty but there are none that I can see\nI Know we have to pause and just a moment to what's what about the flip side of this I mean to the end of this treaty or at least if America pulls out does that mean that it opens the door for an arms race between the U.S and China and North Korea and Russia and whoever else I mean is that the is that the immediate results are is a little more complicated than\nThat it's certainly allows Russia to enter into this space in a big way and to deploy missiles that were prohibited for all these years so yes it's a opening up a nuclear weapons or two more possibilities for Russia\nHow should we view that as a likelihood particularly since we have to pay so much attention to North Korea right now rightly so how likely do you think it is that Russia wants to rebuild that kind of arsenal ... if this treaty went away\nI think very likely it's a it was a very good idea of theirs in the seventies to target Rome in Paris and London and Berlin\nUh to drive a wedge between the NATO allies in Europe and the United states and if that's their objective which it obviously Israel boot and I think there's a great device to do it and they could do it relatively cheaply by having missiles that threatened just those countries and\nIndividually threatening them so I think it's um you know it's a good move for Russia to bad move for America\nMore quick questions I'd love to ask you on the other side of this pause if I may we're speaking to Ken eight I'm In Ronald Reagan's arms control director and former U.S ambassador to the UN

Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim\nAnd I'm sure you're familiar with it [noise] much Mr\nGeneral secretary do my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise]\nThe maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nJeannie a city where the ... the fat at every meeting [noise] from\nThe meeting in Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and ... Gorbachev or give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allowed this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative and Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of ... a\nWhat we really realized was leadership is not a thing that a leader possesses it's not a magic power they point at followers and motivate inspire or direct\nIt's an interaction and what this means is the followers to have a larger agency a larger responsibility for the outcome than we sometimes admit and sometimes even leaders don't admit that they they get put on a pedestal some of them like it some of them are reinforced that\nBut in reality is that interaction between followers which gets to the points of empathy it gets to the points of willingness to understand what your followers need and to followers to understand what the leader needs to be effective\nI Know we have to pause and just a moment but I think this gets to the example that you\nCite in the book of Coco Chanel the inventor of the famous little black dress and the Chanel number five that what she was really selling was the image of herself\nAs this glamorous woman living in a post World war one age when when views of women and women's bodies were beginning to change like if she wasn't able to create that following as a foundation of her business she might never become the leadership gang\nAnd it was extraordinarily thoughtful on her part because she made herself into a symbol SAT lifestyle and then the products that she actually marketed we're all things that allowed a person to be as much like cocoa and her lifestyle has passed\nAnd it was very very powerful and it was important that cocoa understand there couldn't be too great a gap between this alert that she presented and what people could attain sushi had to be related will\nI bet you never thought she'd be studying Coco Chanel for leadership after attending West Point\nJosh what to tell you the truth I didn't know there was a Coco Chanel started this book why I thought it was ... I started with just a brand name I was a actually came from a perfect but she's a fascinating character and and when all is said and done she found an empire she's hard to work for but people flock\nTo follower and flocked to work with her\nWell I'm Glad you know who Coco Chanel have now and we'll get to know some more of the people who you got to know a little bit better in the process of co offering the book\nLeaders Smith and reality we're speaking to retired General Stanley McChrystal the co author of the book we walk him more of your questions and thoughts as well one a ...

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the day I retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way\nBut at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask when so many questions about our society today", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "23"}
