of this year\nNikki Haley is America's ambassador to the United nations and this morning she announced her resignation in the resignation letter Haley says she plans to return to the private sector after fourteen years in public office\nHaley's formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation\nFor being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShould also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get to fused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared knock I guarantee it is such a thing\nThat no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because there and I'm sitting in a strange and I often just have to say I'm certainly thinking of my family my ... at the same and my two little ones I adore them\nAnd continue actually when you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is inflation on for the next ... to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm\nI'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting us well hitting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd these years has flashlight and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's enough to know when you step aside and someone else to do the job so thank you know it's been out of\nMy time and I will say this I'm all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me she went out to be doing is we're paying for that point so I look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nThat isn't Basset or Nikki Haley who represents to us to the United nations speaking this morning at the White House announcing that she will be resigning at the end of the year\nBack now to our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition we should get to an email ... writes I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed work environment ... have you noticed a difference\nOh absolutely absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point working\nIt's not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to time to open up\nIf that alters toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just needs to be this one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves on you to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable looming urban and compassionate and ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of ...\nThat was embedded in their hearts and their families and their workplace like some of the folks from the u._k. said don't get a notion above your station\nYou tight lipped yes stiff upper lip from Holland they said you know the translation is terrible but don't stand taller than all the other poppy but the other poppies in the poppy field\nVulnerability is not easy anywhere because all of that armor is protecting the most human part of us are hard\nWell it's also protecting our job I mean you got to be able to pay rent\nRight sometimes it's protecting our job but sometimes just getting in the way of our job I mean I think about in my own role as a leader and not just as a professor at Twenty years but as the founder and see yeah I Would say\nArmor and the lack of grounded confidence\nHas been the primary reason has been the number one struggle with employees I'm Sorry grounded confident so we can't just ask people to take farmer often show up make and you can't street through work right and the whole disclosure over sharing stuff that's not vulnerability that something else\nBut the real ability to show up and leave you know the number one problem is people who don't do vulnerability don't do hard conversations they avoid conflict they don't talk to people when they're upset they talk about people behind their backs\nSo this whole idea that vote you know being vulnerable is going to cost us our job I Would argue that not being vulnerable\nNot being brave will cost you your job\nBecause when you start having the meeting after the meeting because you're afraid to speak out that's toxic and the culture when you start getting people the dirty yes in the meeting meaning like oh yeah Joshua that sounds like a great idea thanks for sharing and then I get out of the media and say hey make sure you touch actually finding out what that stuff happening\nThat isn't not protecting your job what's protecting your job again if you think phone ability as disclosure this confusing but so let's clear that vulnerability is not disclosure [noise] it's the willingness to stay in a hard conversation when it becomes awkward\nUncomfortable [noise] if the willingness to hold somebody accountable [noise] instead of blaming them is the ability to reset after failure and disappointment\nI Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies when we can continue this for the moment but I Wonder if there are certain kinds of companies where it's more appropriate than others one of our listeners tweeted is this person serious is this a joke keep your opinions out of my place of business or you are fired or there's some

P. in the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with ... brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to ... ... email can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this book because batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense is it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I might protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's on a more it's on a deeper level now it's\nOn a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor the armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is the need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe've got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope

findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the last ... and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive this thing's Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we're more gotcha\nYeah who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nKind of mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere

powerlessness and that I Can't do enough to stop the path of destruction that we're on\nOur pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening took a world this trap corporate level and I'm Still\nMore companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of on the inevitable um two thousand four to you will be here before we know what we will reduce the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us\nSpeaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to be\nGood to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council it is a group a that is co founded by a white\nActually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend who were some of the\nBackers of the council where does the funding come from so um\nThe council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include for the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have\nThere is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon okay\nAnd they just connected the organization or use it as a spin off but is there still a connection in any way or completely separate uh it is\nA separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and a\nA center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nCoral Davenport let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um\n... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and at ... and ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nOr the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of\nEvery kind of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts\nA the global economy on and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time um you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost at once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are ... can essentially um create attacks I'm\nAt a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters have carbon dioxide no no\nNo I haven't I'm Sorry I was her religion would be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car maker do I pay", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
