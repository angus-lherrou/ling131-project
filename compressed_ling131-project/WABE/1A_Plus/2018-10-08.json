justified where it was just I Hope you people never did any power what Lindsey Graham kind of had that moment just got to be a lot of scorched earth in Congress right now\n[noise] you know I I don't necessarily think it's a typical job of individual that senators and lawmakers to strike a unifying tone the did hear that you you heard from a several lawmakers that they hope that this is the low point of the Senate\n... I'm In the Senate can recover from this uh Susan Collins said that\nBut during the Clarence Thomas confirmation battle over Anita Hill you had George H W.

Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed but he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn brought on our Facebook page you can't soft sell this anymore was unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence cheery question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court or you know preponderance oil ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of that [noise]\nSo this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode end to end to the president himself and so forth so\nThat's their view um the the Republican view is that the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing forward one was taken seriously was listen to but then it was roped in by many Democrats on the committee\nWith two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back you know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in\nIn in both as the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to the students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw cabinet spiking the drinks of girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it\nSo um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of\nCollard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Blasey Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um\nMaking sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president's\nKind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to the Senate\nHow did he get home I don't remember how you get or don't remember where was I don't remember how many years I don't want to I don't\nFinally went down and created a compromise with senator with democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware it feels like this is so personal it couldn't be anything but political when it hits like this is where the rubber meets the road I mean even Taylor Swift has come out against Marsha Blackburn for the Democrats\nAs a result of all of us I mean he was part of what I was working with the conversation [laughter] part of what she put it on where we are that's where would you say things like that but if it hadn't heard from ... oh not even a minute here's part of what Taylor Swift wrote on Instagram quote\nSo many intelligence thoughtful self possessed people have turned Eighteen and the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do October nights as the last day to register to vote in the state of Tennessee unquote I mean\nIt just feels like the kind of thing that is so visceral that it's just designed to mobilize people to political\nActivists okay so here's the thing every piece that I've read or or testimonial that I've seen the last few weeks you know about I was raped or I was sexually assaulted therefore I Believe that Kavanaugh did this\nThat's the the the the links that's in my opinion really dangerous right because of course so many women have been victims that doesn't mean this man is guilty I've compared it to any time that you judge people by the group they belong to right\nWe're going to judge Kavanaugh because he's a man I mean we could say the same thing about you know young African American male is arrested for a bank robbery and uh\nYou know you could say well you know young African American males are disproportionately ah caught bank robbing banks so therefore this guy must be guilty that's not the way\nJustice system works at I think you're ... I I think that the emails and the cause you reading that this is something that's absolutely going to mobilize the left and I do think that because Kavanaugh was confirmed\nAt the right may suffer from this at the ballot box however I think that Republicans will happily sacrifice ten Fifteen twenty twenty five house seats\nFor a seat on the Supreme Court and that judges are simply a winning issue for conservatives and they will happily pay a political cost to have at a justice cabin I rather than a defeat a judge cabin on\nBeing as I Know you want to jump in on that I'll give you a chance to do that as soon as we come back I also want to talk about what this might mean for the court itself\nIrwin an Arkansas emailed so we'll Kavanaugh really took the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate what will he actually mean for the Supreme Court [noise] because\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd you're listening to one a an ... point one W.
