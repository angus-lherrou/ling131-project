A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hug be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one say that ... Castro actually did while at HUD how did he\nDistinguish himself now thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure and hug you know for\nYears decades um\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule\nOn so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had ... equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it uh unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration the second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to family living in public housing dean\nTweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is hug doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not that it could do the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary bank are yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken him in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course the low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also to work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more developed bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I\nAgriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so\nIt is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers and so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly with China are but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay with the current state of relations in U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do an degree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and the folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nUh you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nIf you look at the history of this country and you look at um the the Democrats that have prevailed in presidential elections ah they painted a hopeful vision for the future of the country and so I I Believe that that is the right path ultimately\nTo comments about just your visibility your name recognition black ... yeah I could vote for a Castro might be an issue in the Cuban community in Florida\nDifferent Castro's people different Castro's RSP sale wrote on our website I'm Glad Texas politicians are getting some of the national limelight I don't think so and ... are the best examples for for individual roared a Democrat who's running for the U.S Senate\nIn Texas how was the name recognition game going for you just in terms of getting people to know who you are and what you're about\n[noise] uh well I mean you know my brother and I have both been active um of course in Texas but uh now across the country for the last few years um if I decide to run for president I guess I'll concern myself more about that ah remember that\nThat the president a primary is not a national election is a state by state primary and caucus election\nOn so folks need to do the hard work and Iowa New Hampshire or the other early states\nUh to to be able to do well of course raising your name id nationally and that leads to your ability to fund race is important um but you know basically been out there I'm making sure that the folks who are going to get the caucus or if I decide to run or that they get to know me\nOne more question I Would ask you mentioned your twin brother who is a congressman you talk a lot about him particularly in the early parts of the book and how you too where the\nMost competitive twin brothers who ever lived there for how was having a twin affected the way you view politics\nUm that's a good question I don't think anybody has asked me the question in that way I Would just say you know uh what's interesting about being a twin is that everybody sees you the same way right like you're part of a package you're uninsured groupie or all of a package deal\nAnd I guess it's helped me to understand issues of identity and how people think about themselves in politics or because I grew up and everybody saw me as part of somebody else\nLeon Castro the new book is called an unlikely journey waking up from my American Dream secretary Castro it's been a pleasure thanks for talking to us thanks for having me\nComing up we don't want to lose sight of the disappearance and alleged murder of
