purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one\nFlorida State representative who ... who was a Republican sponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a. serious speaking on W F for TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old a who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being\nFor the world particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them all so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're

those are just\nThat state rep Hosea will leave out in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYeah than our as challenging it in court I think I'm Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the n._r._a. for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nThink that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me as it passed in the state of Florida rat has long been one of the\nStrongest a sort of incubator ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think it's very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and

let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words up the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times and account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues during doctor for its testimony now I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were and at the pie TST it made me rethink\nMy decision to to stay silent Ken my own experience can\nYou share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy\nAt who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did a one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I asked him to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in when it happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nApproved whatever the word I'm looking for a friend from right right um because I felt like it ... it was it was all the people in power\nSaying to all the survivors we don't believe you and you don't matter\nUm\nBecause of that and the memories of that which I Do feel in my body that moment when when the yes vote went through I did not watch\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford's and jet Brett Kavanaugh's tests the money I just felt too unbearable to me I Do think that uh assuming that he gets confirmed\nOr it will be different not that it isn't the people in power saying we don't believe you and you don't merit matter there is still that and it will still feel that powerful to many many survivors\nAt the same time now we're hearing\nHundreds of people saying me too I share your story this happened to me mine was slightly different and\nI'm with you and and people saying I have your back I Believe you so I think the cultural context while we have a long way to go has really shifted um and\nThat progress won't be taken away\nProfessor Conan I Know we have to pause momentarily but what do you think about the possible effects on survivors of the capital confirmation process before we have to break\n[noise]\nI'm hoping that the effects are you know in the long term positive that the public conversation as on the other guy\nSad um [noise] helps people to feel that they're not alone um and that at least some people have their back as even if again having even if he gets confirmed\nI'm I've also seen there's been a lot of public evidence of men coming out in support and powerful men and women um and shows like this one\nSo I'm hoping that and the longer term it will be positive for sexual assault survivors generally and they'll be a sea change 'em that we'll see they'll have ripple effects on the line\nI Would love to get your sense of the roles that men play in this me too movement particularly men who have been the offenders Jaime tweeted a male perspective is needed to move the needle other men need to hear from men who have been the perpetrator and why they did it I think some and can't get why a guy would do this to begin with\nAnd need to understand that part in order to believe the women more\nWhat role should men be playing induce me too movement will try to get some answers to that and more in just a moment single ups [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is one a ... point one W.

as I said here's one more that came into\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years it it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious marks it's\nEasy to pretend that never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is she\nLives thanks very much for sharing your story with us more geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes after that it's been like\nThat after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things that many that that I doubt less but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nOn and off huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs\n'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nI just wanted to um\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "02"}
