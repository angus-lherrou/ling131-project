man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr forge testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words up

program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times and account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nUnremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been and colleagues as well just sharing\nStories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony now I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they ran out of the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to just stay silent Ken my own experience\nCan you share with this to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on gas\nFor a long time I think and we both had an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nAsked him to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly um yeah I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know it was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nSaying to all the survivors we don't believe you and you don't matter\nUm\nBecause of that and the memories of that which I Do feel in my body that moment when when the yes vote went through I did not watch\nI'm Christine Blasey Ford's and jet Brett Kavanaugh's tests the money I just felt too unbearable to me I Do think that uh assuming that he gets confirmed\nOr it will be different not that it isn't the people in power saying we don't believe you and you don't merit matter there is still that and it will still feel that powerful to many many survivors\nAt the same time now we're hearing\nHundreds of people saying me too I share your story this happened to me mine was slightly different and\nI'm with you and and people saying I have your back I Believe you so I think the cultural context while we have a long way to go has really shifted um and\nThat progress won't be taken away\nProfessor Conan I Know we have to pause momentarily but what do you think about the possible effects on survivors of the capital confirmation process before we have to break\n[noise]\nHoping that the effects are you know in the long term positive that the public conversation as on the other guests have said um [noise] helps people to feel that they're not alone um and that at least some people have their back\nEven if again having even if he gets confirmed I'm I've also seen a there's been a lot of public evidence of men coming out in support and powerful men and women um and shows like this one\nSo I'm hoping that in the longer term it will be positive for sexual assault survivors generally and they'll be a sea change 'em that we'll see they'll have ripple effects on the line\nI Would love to get your sense of the rule that men play in this me too movement particularly men who have been the offender timing tweeted a male perspective is needed to move the needle other men need to hear from men who have been the perpetrator and why they did it I think

with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorist in tone and we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years it it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with this market love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that incident like that after an attack like that\nWow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story and you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before I\nWas molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of Brian Brown the social researcher yeah shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that chain needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nI just wanted to um\n[noise]\nMarketplace morning report is supported

I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress has almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents just doesn't go\nAnywhere in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in a notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index and essentially to a real life\nNow what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation sued housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said at the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for a full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers in the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor sets the increased ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nYou know the Seattle study they got a lot of attention some of the leading economists that initially and taken notice of it have since I'm backed off and said they no longer find credible people like MIT is David Autor\nOr and then there's been a isn't for an important new research that just come out using um it's a sort of the state of the art methodology published in the journal of labor economics which is one drink a lot of plot at some looked in particular the U.S states with the highest minimum wages and found\nNo evidence that they that uh jobs are are are are are have been hurt by a as these wages a phased in but I really think the best evidence is what we the business press in what were we all see on the ground in the cities that are facing in these higher minimum wages you know take\nYou know New York or do you see where we were were were the participants are right now New York is phasing it it's Fifteen dollar minimum wage Thirteen now we'll go to Fifteen on New Year's eve the restaurant industry is booming and cranes who your business is reporting\nThat the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is a is not hurting jobs and they are in fact a growing faster than ever in the ... the same is true in DC and in fact I Know you you were going to raise the tipped wage debate a little bit later but I think what's significant most DC is it's phasing in a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and\nA despite the debate over tips the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is not controversial in the restaurant industry itself is not making any attempt to attack it it really\nAnd and we see the same in Los Angeles Chicago Seattle the other major cities or you know low wage jobs I mean jobs in restaurants retail the sectors most affected by the minimum wage really are continuing to grow strongly and the ... the only places they're seeing real raises are where uh where were these much higher minimum wages are facing you know\nThe comments and questions are pouring in from one listeners Jonathan emails I currently work for ten dollars an hour and with my experience Fifteen dollars an hour is closer to a fair amount it's enough to help cover hidden costs of employment like transportation fuel costs repair maintenance for vehicles tools close et cetera\nRyan treats you say it's common for a minimum wage employee to get a raise after twelve months\nBut I work for a chain of auto parts doors and it took two years and the race was a whopping\nTwelve cents Ryan ads the hash tag\nFight for Fifteen and Michael emails I don't buy that Amazon's decision has anything to do with altruism I Believe Amazon's decision had much more to do with the incredibly competitive job market and its ability to grow its job force in preparation for the holiday season if they can spin it in a way that makes them look like good guys\nWill then good for them and I think some of our guests might agree with that coming up we have a lot more of your questions and comments about labor and wages today we're back in a minute stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's one a Ninety point one W.

business cyber security health care and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nLooking back to ... with you today I'm\nSorry I understand I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios of WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington as the world knows it\nBut D.C as locals know there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are\nThe process of voting this very day\nTo overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for tipped workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voted to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nI'm sad really that minimum wage for tips workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to um bring that a wage up to that the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr ... at jobs where people face rampant sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a a\nN E L A wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips it did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national\nShowdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nA Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it\nWell actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far out numbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees and DC\nAre according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are what their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well and what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees\nThat you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who were fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "03"}
