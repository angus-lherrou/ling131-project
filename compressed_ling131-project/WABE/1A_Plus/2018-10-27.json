up our series the state we're in on one day\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post roughly ... of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast probably let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex of the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's the hats because I mean well he doesn't want to go that far but\nBut also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in this speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's this\nA you area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals\nWithin the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed re in the last few months that a lot of the website you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nAfraid of this month juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for green as the individual in question given that the media for being subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of the story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron the pain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the
