Medicaid expansion and even some\nDemocrats are sort of centrist Democrats were saying well if this is the price that we have to pay\nTo get Medicaid expansion um than it's worth it or however they are all Arkansas which was one of the first states to approve a work requirements that date where it's actually operate that's right and there are early reports um\nThat uh many many people ... almost five thousand people ended up losing their Medicaid coverage as a result of these requirements and that is focused attention again on on whether or not on what the requirements should be and whether it's a fair a right to require people um [noise]\nUh to to work if they have uh other are facing other challenges Julie\nAnd I just want to say something about Arkansas what's interesting what we've seen again that's the sort of the first test it's not that these people aren't working they're not losing their Medicaid because they're not working they're losing their medicate because they've been unable to navigate the reporting system which are all on line and there's a lot of people in Arkansas who don't have access to computers um\nYou mean reporting system for declaring that they are working\nLike actually a good time she exactly they basically not been able to submit their time cheat a lot of them I've seen a lot of reporting where people have gone around and and some of the people on Medicaid don't even have any idea get that they're supposed to be doing this um you know they did was we we all ... the medical director and the people who did it\nYou know why are you doing this on line when so many people don't have Internet access\nAnd the response was well you should be able to be to find a place with Internet access and use it that will be part of helping you get a job um that was sort of their argument was they wanted it to be all on line but because it is all on line a lot of people have not been able to basically prove that they're working\nI just want to talk about the political prospects for passing Medicaid expansion through the ballot box as we continue our conversation with Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberg of state line and read

brother Joaquin is a congressman who Leon writes about his brother in the book and says that they are the most competitive brothers who ever lived and we asked him how having a twin affects his view on politics\nWhat's interesting about being a twin is that everybody sees you the same way right like you're part of a package your your group deal a package deal\nAnd I guess it's helped me to

V. O. M. radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOr one thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that until I mean I go to jail before I put the stage and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political theater I mean how's this going to end\nWell a ... page is he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh ... it was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nHe probably shouldn't have one in the political side and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came in to shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point all the pages turned out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that are that they're up there\nUm but now it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions there are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have the health care that\nThat they need and and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and a ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about this and about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nA question that should be between a doctor and patient you shouldn't have a blanket rule on how how\nHow what the supply um should be also there's a concern that if you cut people off they you might be pushing them toward a more dangerous so dangerous opioids heroin or fentanyl um and also there are people who are in chronic pain who really do need these drugs and um [noise]\nUh they also have been increasingly vocal about a these are what they consider to be draconian limits on prescribing so it's a very complicated issue the federal bill instead of\nGoing that direction emphasized expansion of of treatments so now allow Medicaid to pay for residential treatment in large facilities and also will allow Medicare to pay for methadone um treatment\nThere is also a another set of laws that some states passed this year that would expand access to the ... which is a drug to reverse an overdose some states including Arizona and Rhode Island passed laws that allow for a coke prescription of ... so when opioids are also prescribe is that right\nAh yes ... is a drug that can be administered that will a reverse an overdose Senate ... in addition to the uh\nThe measures you mentioned are some states have taken steps to to get in the locks on in the hands of first responders and and also to uh uh to pass so called good Samaritan laws so that if for example of\nA two people are using drugs or perhaps heroin and illegal drug and uh someone overdoses that uh if if the other person the friend uses the locks them that they won't be\nIn trouble with law enforcement just or if they're called and called them\nJust a quick point on this the states that you mentioned Arizona in Rhode Island are are pretty much the most a polar opposite polar opposites that you can get politically and I think that underscores a broader point\nThat the ... the measures that are responding to the opioid overdose are coming from very conservative states and very liberal states uh and everybody in between when when I go out to state legislative conferences and asked the state legislators what the biggest issue is facing their states\nEvery single one of them says the opioid crisis it crosses all kinds of party lines this was there's there's no partisanship in any part of this\nJulie and I should point out that the bill that just passed the Congress a couple of weeks ago was also extremely bipartisan um you know while they were busy in the middle of that huge fight about you know a justice cabin or they were busy putting together its enormous opioid failed that came from Republicans Democrats conservatives and liberals at something that basically everybody agrees on big\nSea tweeted we live in Arkansas and my husband a labor now has health insurance for the first time in ten years although we do live thirty minutes from the closest public Internet access\nWe just provide checked stuff's as proof of work to meet the work requirement months in law suite of the question about Medicaid

A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support is that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible well\nOf course the people who have an employer plans with hijacked our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular large problem if you have many thousands of dollars and deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to uh basically fill in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way the Affordable CARE Act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em Medicaid people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth\nBetween Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of this series that's supposed to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all the sort of small incremental changes\nThat the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the\nThe junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the vertical CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were before and as well\nAs Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're joined the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance in our state you are going to abide by these rules\nYou can join that community by calling six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety or W.

A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSo have you been giving us your suggestions\nFor what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalists are suggesting would cause harm\nFrom my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future autonomy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\n... actually environmental science and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and\nTeaching about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are just regular people who might not have the education that I have\nHad that climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\n... it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefit\nThat will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nHave I I'm constantly re framed as unqualified to broker information in the public and so we if we want to talk about integrating science into public policy entered and developing trust we really want to get more and more curious about\nAnd what are the ... ... why our voices being eliminated from the public forum why do we have such a a partisan distorted narrative\nBut it is harder pointing out that this is a U.S phenomena sure the part as they shouldn't have climate change is not a global phenomenon\nIt doesn't exist in most of the world and we need to reflect on the U.S political and cultural system right now in our norms and and do some honest thinking about\nAre we being manipulated by people who have self interest that aren't matching up with the long term self interest in the American people which is what many of us believe is happening this is a U.S problem almost unique clean it's political and cultural aspects\nI Would agree with that but I just want to reflect back again that the entire world by and large and the world's global resources are run by men and those decisions are made by a man and so one of the fundamental aspects of solutions for climate change has to do with anti racism\nAnd an anti ... and that is that a global level has that the closer we get to on an equitable and safe society for every one specifically for the rights of girls and women\nThen that's a component of the pathway for us to get the or does it remind added options there was a little more was just I like to discuss I Know we have to pause will finish this up on the other side of the break I'd like to kind of\nDo a little bit of role playing of what she can say to folks in certain kinds of debates to some of the more common objections including like just the being or cycles are where does the science come from\nWe also got a good question is Marlene who wrote on our website the one eight dot org so if you change people's minds what then\nI see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their own Mick mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like it's someone else's tomorrow not ours\nInteresting point Arlene even if you win the argument what do you do to turn the argument into action and if you haven't done that\nDoes that mean your argument failed that is at stake lives in [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's one a on member supported Ninety point

we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one day you know if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life\nWhat did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story

to get going and too much shut you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in global way\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties\nThere were a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not\nStrong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but just being able to have the conversation and a useful successful way\nI think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have to have it in that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and ... and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "16"}
