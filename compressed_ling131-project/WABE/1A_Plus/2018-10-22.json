Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite although the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the homes that were were standing in the homes of weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor ... that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has\nTo tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point on and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and lie to the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well listen\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice and luxurious thing yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there\nAnd so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm us a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real estate why conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for properties to be built and to be built and frankly in an ... resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is
