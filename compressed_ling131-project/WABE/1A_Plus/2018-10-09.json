series the state where in about legislative trends at the state level\nNext month in the midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over Twenty one states already have these commissions\nSupporters say independent commissions helped make districts more competitive critics say it's too much power to give an elected officials\nJoining us to discuss it is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read welcome back to want to say hey Joshua also with us is David daily a senior fellow at fair vote a nonprofit focused on electoral reform David is also the author of an upcoming book about redistricting called the rising David welcome\nThanks for having me back and joining us from WG VU public radio in Grand Rapids Michigan is Katie ... she's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians which is based in Grand Rapids Haiti thanks for joining us\nGlad to be a Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you if you were just explain what we mean when we talk about\nRedistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the defending your senses\nThe census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere is a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power from other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or that the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there and when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the press\nOf term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leaving we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing state of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington a Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nI think that's exactly right California and these other initiatives this year as well you know Colorado and Michigan are trying to find actual citizens to do this and California certainly proved that after all citizens can do this and do it really well\nWe'll continue our conversation in just a moment with David daily senior fellow at fair vote read Wilson national correspondent for the hill and Katie Fay he's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians we got quite a few comments from you on the impact of Republicans on gerrymandered districts\nBut it's just really an issue that mostly affects Republicans or Democrats just kind of getting away with not getting the criticism they might deserve\nThat's just the head but before we pause we also spent some time today getting your

senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like a goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nThis is they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district Louisiana six Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to\nBe disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but then there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper down in in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning

in that big city in terms of the impediments to getting at the root of bad policing when it shows up\nSo it it's an important first of all to understand that when you talk about the police it's not a monolithic group there's generally the rank and file and that refers to the union and then you have the leadership that command staff and really what what controls what happens with the police department it's really the rank and file\nPolice unions are very very powerful in this country and while the\nPower of other unions in other professions has declined over the last eight and two ...

Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such asserted it has to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI\nAnd um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nThen be carried by six\nPresumably meaning that it's better to deal with\nThe criminal justice system than to be shot on the job new Franklin I have to pause and just a minute but could you speak to this idea\nOf the mentality of officers and this this cone of silence I mean there are officers who want corruption rooted out there's also the police union which has to speak in the larger sense protect every single officer who is a dues paying member ... how do you see this before we have to break\nFirst um just comment on what judge Cordell set about unions unions and their power\nAnd the other thing she said it was about police oversight and we need community oversight of police department and move away from police policing the police are just went and that's a whole nother story as it relates to the mentality and thought process of these officers I mean also Spalding hit it right on the head\nYou know what she was talking about is absolutely correct\nBut I Want to say something about\nThe officers who would come to her and speak to her and and all those officers out there who don't want this type of policing who don't want the corruption who don't want the officers like Van Dyke who have these many many complaints [noise]\nIf they were to come together their numbers are so much greater if they were to come together\nAnd and and and form a movement to remove these officers out of the ranks so they can be the police officers ended apartments that they want to be for their citizens\nWe wouldn't have this but if they're not capable of doing that we need community oversight of these police department so I just want to push push back on that just a little bit because talking about the few bad habits\nYou know the ones who don't come forward like ... are they not also problematic in allowing this to occur\nEmile I'm Sorry I I I hate to cut you short we're going to pick this conversation up on the other side of this break but I Need to get to a little bit of breaking news that has\nCome out since we went to air or we're just learning that Nikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations\nIs resigning ms Haley's the former governor of South Carolina she had been early infrequent critic of President Trump and then joined the administration as the U.S ambassador to the un\nAccording to NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele ... according to Michelle sources at the state department\nNikki Haley informed her staff today that she would resign President Trump has tweeted quote big announcement with my friend ambassador Nikki Haley in the oval office at ten thirty AM unquote that's right about now we'll keep an ear and an eye on that but again NPR's reporting that Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the un has resigned\nMore in a moment because\nThis is one a on member supported Ninety point one W.
