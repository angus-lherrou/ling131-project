Charles the story was followed by Kevin Shaw I mean I filmed a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry I think that that followed a Charles a story\nAnd they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know ... you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bringing our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end of sentence agility for fun tweet it up\nEvery episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but that invitation remains open\nWe also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school next and rouse we were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWas that she more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmend the Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W.

to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of them\nOr one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall one person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and the woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nCan push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make\nTo me I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity\nAnd then how are those opportunities denied and real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack Latino students across the country do not ... not the chemical denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve let's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I I'm not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise]\nBut you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some I pass work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for any one high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of lay\nHer essay is there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one

A. M. U. dot org\nDot com and with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but\nDidn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Susanna how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... ... large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus would get a valuations of you know five ten million\nIt's kind of like the beginning of a Donald Trump infomercial in a way that really is it really is and I think in the minds of\nMillions of Americans who saw him for the first time in the course of that show uh other than you know articles about his his his various marriages\nUm that that really really set the the the cast for or how they view him and how they would remember him as he began to increasingly partake in public affairs\nHow how Suzanne how Fred Trump feel about this image that Donald Trump was cultivating the way that your article is written the kind of suggests that that French Trump was not only okay with this image even by playing fast and loose with tax laws he kind of she was in on it he supported\nIt\nWe find very much on when we started the reporting that that Donald received\nVery little if any pushback from his father um there's times where he's quoted an article articles you know saying that\nYou know Donald's more brilliant than I Am and these these things go on at Fred Fred we never see points where he he really pushed back publicly\nBut there is one interesting moment in the story it becomes I think it really important um inflection point between a father and son and not soft or you know decades of Fred Trump both I'm giving a his son Donald money a year in and year out and loans and\nIncreasing those loans and money flow as Donald got into trouble in Nineteen Ninety ... Trump is is you know at the final years of his life around and the pushback\nRather privately but Donald Trump had one of his lawyers are in in late Nineteen Ninety and this is a point of great financial distress in Donald Trump's life he had a lawyer dropped a caught us all to his father's well essentially and knew well\nAnd that will that caught us all was presented to Fred Trump um without Donald being there but by lawyers and Fred Trump\nUm you know he flipped out he saw it as a way for his\nSon uh he felt his son was trying to gain control of all of his empire and potentially put at risk so why you don't see a public um pushback by Fred\nI'm In fact you see I'm In you know you see a loving father there at every moment or not private moment you saw a very big pushback of of what Donald Trump was doing\nMore to discuss with Suzanne Craig and rust Buechner of the New York times will get into more of the details of the report and also consider what impact this report might have if any stimulus [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nUm\nYou're listening to one a on members' support in Ninety point one W.

W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and uh I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality of the uh the ... that we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed real low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it sort of a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which they don't understand\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "25"}
