political moment\nRight and uh you know it brings up this tribalism and the polarization that we see in the media space in which Charlie was ill and others are so excellent it chronicling the far right um hyper partisan reaches of the Internet and the media space but I think\nThe real question here is we come up with a lot of this both sides of them and what about is them that comes out in the media with people saying well you know if there's hatred on the right there is also hatred on the left I Do agree with your caller that what we don't see this radicalized violent\nUm you know enactment of some of the statements that are coming from the very top that is really worrying of course there's always been hate in our culture the problem is that a lot of this hate seems to have been a welcome somehow to come out of the recesses and the woodwork\nUm with a sort of silent not from people at the top and that is incredibly worrying there needs to be instead of blaming the media

I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment would First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given to the new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nAnd and sort of shifted the standard of acceptability for\nA lot of ironic racism I I spend a lot of time in a message board communities on the Internet that has had produced you know an a number of of hateful a people and and even people who have gone on to commit\nViolent acts and and some of them most of them aren't\nOf that persuasion but they're they're and they're participating in it um because they're building a community a\nYou know the Internet is fantastic uh at\nFinding people and giving them a feeling of belonging and and oftentimes in some of these underbelly communities it is around using\nA taboo language bigoted language slurs I'm putting down people or you know ... of minority background and I and I ... speaking to some of these people and communities like for a chance you know they said to me I knew that this isn't necessarily right\nI'm and I'm maybe not even I'm I'm not even proud of that but there is a community around this sort of thing and and what it does is it ... ... you to use that language and it starts out in an ironic sort of\nUm you know I don't mean this with any endorsement but for them fun kind of way um they're playing around with things that they can't say anywhere else and ah\nAnd sort of feeling all that out and then it's slowly becomes\nA you know indoctrinated into who you are there is someone who told me that you know when I see\nAfter after ten years of being on these forums when I see you know means or images of anti Semitic means or images I Can't not think about all these terrible things it's hard coated into my brain even if I Know deep down\nMaybe it's wrong for and so I think that we don't talk enough about that that that with the Internet does it build that community but it also provides this reputation and it slowly ships your ... yet will quickly I mean modern social psychology and this kind of study has been replicated again and again dozens of times\nAnd has this it shows that there is group polarization and this happens even before the Internet and but the Internet really magnify that and the idea is when people are listening and talking to extremists they take a more extremist position they become even more radicalized ... economists\nWrote about this and Bloomberg opinion and I recommend the column which really explains it\nCheryl tweeted how do we identify and he'll ... angry men in our society who view violence is the only way to express their discontent interesting question Cheryl put that question to our panel and do a lot when on Charlie wars are won rabbi Jill Jacobs and we'll get to some more of your questions and thoughts as well because [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to one a on member supported Ninety point one W.

and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAG W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News\nTheir lives and propaganda that

America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious situation also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have started with religious views\nAnd a close and actually the state of Israel I mean I teach at a small school here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable House bill that um\nYou know if they express a strong and here is that of Israel or it's this religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not typically\nStrongly support of Israel and one way or the other but um but our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids they probably should need need to shut up you know and I don't show up at the you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that they're not\nThey're not federal everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard David let me put\nThat to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all laughed and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of these trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policy it's rather crosses over into", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "29"}
