Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still had never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America\nI remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and nonpartisan up Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back\nDuring the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor that Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that\nWith the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years old [noise] even the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise] back in twenty\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meaning Republicans at your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ... and in the Trump beer it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I it it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the\nThe lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about\nTwenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last ... Obama and concluded what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins and I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course\nEasy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's what I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things um in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told and boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted or than\nMore than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThis last week in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh I saw Republican conservative operatives on social media using language\nLike this in their view what the Democrats are trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh is about one thing they want the right to kill babies over and over you heard you'd heard and saw this language on social media Pat Buchanan sowed the seeds and now they have they have flourished well in in in\nThe abortion is a major part of the divide in when we talk about the sorting out of the parties\n... think about this right now the number of uh anti abortion Democrats in the U.S house\nIt depends how you define as I think the numbers down to like to right now if you went back to this started in Nineteen Ninety\n... it was nearly a hundred Pennsylvania Ohio all over yeah you know in Nineteen eighty two is the year one of the reasons Pat Buchanan made that speech in Ninety two was that the er the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania Bob casey at that point father at current senator\nPro life Democrat wanted to speak was not given a a major spot the Democratic convention and the Republicans and B can and saw an opportunity to draw a line there Ninety two is also the last time you had a major push on the Republican side\nTo put pro choice language into the Republican platform or at least in acknowledgement of pro choice of using the Republican Party and bill weld\nWho's the governor of Massachusetts showed up at that convention he had the governor of Maine with him a few other moderate liberal Republicans and they were pretty much shut down on the floor in Nineteen Ninety two and it's one of those moments you look at it now\nYou're not going to find a pro choice Republican winning a national nomination you're not going to find any type abortion Democrat doing it they're totally sort it out on that issue\nThose lines of not just been drawn they had been absolutely walled off and ... says Steve ... will from a Delphi Maryland sent us\nEmail we must change the system to allow the emergence of other parties I Can't see that happening unless we moved to a preferential voting system\nWhich would allow other parties to prosper after one explosive election we're going to talk with Steve ... a lot more about how the political strikes but the nineties can frame today's audio logical battles will be back in just a minute this is one I because\n\n\nI see is one day with me Joshua Johnson on Ninety point one W.

Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote\nHe even went so far as to say that Dr Ford's allegations\nWere nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit filled with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote\nQuote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and\nHow quickly this behavior revealed hostility and belligerent that is becoming someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking\nThat more than two thousand four hundred law professors from around the country have expressed their opposition\nThey wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and tear the allegations that were raised judge Kavanaugh responded in an in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupted and at times was this courteous to\nDianne Feinstein of California making her arguments here before the and vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh talking about the judge's temperament during his testimony last week needed Totenberg what are you learning about\nWhat we saw the Justice John Paul Stevens the retired from the Supreme Court last night he was raised Kevin on the path said he said he'd changed his mind after he saw this performance I've talked to some of Kavanaugh's colleagues on the bench on both republic\nAnd if he's in democratic appointees and they were really shocked by what they call the dropping of a veil they never knew was there where\nHe talked about a conspiracy to get revenge for the Clintons because he was part of the Ken Starr investigation no evidence for that but that was his view and extended under oath\nYeah and and they never seen it and were shocked\nOkay Nina Totenberg has got to remain with us as we continue our coverage here today and let's just review very briefly where we are and then in a moment we're going to take a break and continue hearing the speeches here\nSay to continue hearing the speeches today Charles Grassley of Iowa lead off today alleging that left wing groups have quote shame does all with their effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh he said that Senate investigators had been tracking down virtually all leads and that there was nothing at an FBI report we didn't already know\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh and that it's time to confirm this man Dianne Feinstein speaking right now saying that this is a judge willing to disregard president who believes that the president of the United states is above and outside the law\nAnd a man filled with aggression we'll continue our special coverage on NPR News\n[noise]\nListening to special coverage\nOn that point one W.

A. B. E. Atlanta\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away\nFrom a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republican ... yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominated the court would not even get a vote it was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it\nMitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg has were this year and you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what she would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their sides\nBut don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budget they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the day is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away [noise] ah they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults much trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight they have been found and what what they're saying shifts if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days we'll we'll don't talk about that a little bit more on a moment apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well\nWas poisoning from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh from a list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade\nCutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and fairness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not anymore not after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say\nWhether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed that in the United states of America everyone is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate cash\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation\nWill still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American flight\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not well not set the bar\nSo low\nShow madam president today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people had been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far left protestors still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's where I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen\nEighties that was incredibly enlightened\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course some number of judge Kavanaugh's classmate set him straight earlier this week\nI'll stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity the indignity\nThis\nIs our approach to confirming a Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\n\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the ACA dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was a bunch of like clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks\nAdjust now calling him the vote there were about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had that is what he described was listening to the uh the action on the floor now\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states sent by Seventeen senators\nAnonymous consent of the medical record probably was is there an objection\nAny action by unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense that the Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the Rome history Alexander\n...\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while uh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here uh Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been saying all morning that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today\nJust joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voting yes\nIsn't that a yes that is usually the case but there are lots of moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind to the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last year riled\nCare because we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still voted against the nominee if you should want to do that there is one ah let's give a listen actually to some of what Susan Collins has been saying today she spoke briefly to reporters off the Senate floor\nI Will be voting yes\nOn the head that final confirmation vote and I will announce may intense and sign how to vote later today\nAnd uh you hear everyone tried to get one more question there Susan Collins leaving us in suspense for a few more hours another person on that list of for Joe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia a Scott has he been paying attention to those speeches this morning\nHe's been paying very close attention we know that Joe Manchin spent more than an hour and that secure room in the Senate today rereading that report he went to the Senate floor not necessarily giving away his hands on how will vote but we are seeing that just now one of those undecided senators Jeff Flake did appear to vote I on cloture\nAgain that may not necessarily be his final vote but we know that flake was initially inclined to to support judge Kavanaugh before he changed his mind last\nAugust ... either way mentioned by the way I always went to the hearings and he sat there two hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today than looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a ... yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes disadvantages too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short or they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens to the United states give a listen to some of\nThat let's bring that up and give a listen Moran\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote at their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... care where with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree\nIt would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary and let's just listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\n[noise] Mr Toomey Mr Udall\nIs there a Van Hollen\nMr Warner Okay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is I don't know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a sperm sense the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assume doesn't know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin and you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the room is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed\nRepublicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is the correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia home we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin ... that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cab and all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia He's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a
