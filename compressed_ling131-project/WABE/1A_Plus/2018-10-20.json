Hampshire public radio senior political correspondent Josh Rogers\nFranco or don't is White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nYou showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to end these comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the of the arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nIt's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will view\nOf the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the gifts that they brought up a\nTypically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and they we haven't yet seen him and typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of and the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonists and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term ... up here who's your favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at one point Franco or ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been them as fast\nEating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot or for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for art\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was gonna ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean\nI Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether it rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nUm to take him to office and this caravan\nUh is is being used in that sense of saying look these tweets that he did yesterday blaming Democrats are blaming open borders or to the Democrats that I spoke to they see this is largely a political move on to try to steer\n'em responsibility away from his own policies because of some of the policies that you got that was talked about just a minute ago have not been successful and\nCamping down or clamping down on some of the migration take family my ... family separation policy and that really blew up in his face um you know trying to cut down on the border and the reality is we're seeing a we're back to kind of record number of migration coming to the border\nAlexandra before we have to pause to the defense secretary did authorize deploying four thousand National Guard troops along the border I Wonder what we make about whether it was kind of a deployment with the hopes that the governor has refused to deploy these troops I mean what what was behind that\nI mean as Franco noted it's a bit of a political play um it's sort of accept Trump's promise with um at least an attempted action but the question is will that do anything will that change anything as Frank mentioned even though the Trump Administration has implemented stronger immigration policy it's\nThese border crossings are still coming and folks are still attempting to enter the country so at the end of the day it it seems like more of sort of a a PR move or move to uh\nBack at the president rather than anything that will have an effect\nMore to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup was Alexander Jaffe Franco or don't yes and Josh Rogers two big stories in the world of TV that caught our

friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and Franco or don't is Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire the race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district the Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen\nRight absolutely trading hymns party departed from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years it's now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their party's pap has just been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates he um he comes from Manchester with\nIt's a town the where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris Pappas those you know part of some sort of resistance movement is is saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um [noise]\nAnd uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nIs also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government governor ... new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... listen\nIt's going to help families and how it's going to help people be more productive at work and sell\nIt can win win everywhere I go in the state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that knowledge when they're meeting them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge to somebody covering the first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue\nHe was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction amounted to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know Christian new new son of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people's the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and\nThis is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know Sunni should win or you know we have to your terms here no governor's been talks after one term", "year":
