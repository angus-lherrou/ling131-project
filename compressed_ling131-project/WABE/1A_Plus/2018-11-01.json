rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets plan this\n... question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and maybe would inform my answer here and in part of that is a reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that and there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the\nI didn't see in the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective\nUm and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that uh is especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message a you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right and because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using\nThe bully pulpit the good poll that of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities um and and so in this case a lot of times the press is bend guilty as if we'll find those messages when they shouldn't have\nReal there's just one second Jennifer we are possible continuous debate in the mobile with Jennifer ...

ahead Mac found dot org\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing the role of political rhetoric in public life particularly these latest acts of politically motivated violence and whether or not President Trump\nAny responsibility at all for these acts we're discussing with Jennifer ... an American political rhetoric expert from Texas a and M. university Heidi by wreck of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Nick Gillespie of reason magazine\nRonald writes on our Facebook page one hate speech is allowed a platform under the guise of free speech hate will proliferate and violence will follow just wanted to read this comment by way of bringing up we've mentioned this on the program before but just to be clear\nHate speech is protected under the first amendment you are allowed to speak hateful things in public the line is when it fails what the Supreme Court calls the clear and present danger test when it's considered to be intended to cause imminent violence and likely to cause him and violence so I I hear where you're coming from Ronald but just\nTo be clear under the law hate speech is free speech speech that is designed to end likely the cause of violence that has not protected under the first amendment\nNick two of our commenters mentioned the same example which also has come up in free speech Supreme Court cases Robert writes research supports that hateful vitriolic speech drives hateful behavior the logic is blatantly obvious why is it illegal to yell fire in a crowded theater\nAnd ski at tweets if we can't yell fire in a crowded theater why can the president yelled at immigrants lead to rapists in a crowded country neck\nOr you know because that's the law and um you know it is amazing ah what we need a you know and and you know I I think part of part of what we're struggling with\nUm is Trump is a master of using the media to to make everything about himself and then everything becomes a referendum about him I mean literally since before he took office\nEvery news cycle every day I mean even you know the the day or you know ... ... less than forty eight hours after the synagogue shooting he talked about the media is the true enemy of the people any shifted the focus away from the synagogue shooting and the specifics of that back to\nHis ongoing a critique of the press what I think that's kind of pointing these comments I mean if you yell fire\nIn a theater that is not in fact on fire then you can cause a stampede people hurt just based on saying one word fire that one word and cause trouble so like calling someone your enemy you don't lean back when you feel an enemy is approaching you that's a word this is on one side action\nThis is also where you know and I mean it's a you know I'm a parent myself and it's kind of a bizarre conversation to be having with the you know it was Seventy something year old man who's the president of the United states but it's like\nIf we continue to take the bait and by that I mean you know not to ... we're all part of the media now in in various ways whether or not we actually you don't have a a company that publishes a newspaper or something like that\nWe need to we need to be engaging this in a different way and it and I'm not saying that we we ignore it and things like that but\nYou know talking about the caravan is like is fascinating um you know what reason we publish stories recently both looking at what is the makeup of the actual people in the caravan which is not you know a bunch of unknown middle Easterners as\nDonald Trump has tweeted and it's not ISIS agents and it's not even you know very many men\nAre looking at the demographics of the caravan looking at the countries that are emigrating from which the United states has a long history of of ah you know really bad\nForeign policy you wouldn't make that kind of felt like that kind of feels like when someone yells fire in a crowded theater you ask well where in the theater is is there a fire ... that\nIt doesn't work that way that visceral reaction takes over and may well have taken over\nFor this guy who shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh it sounds like\nYou're trying to have an apples and oranges argument about what is what I'm saying is you you are not you are not going to win an argument with Donald Trump by you know being visceral and reactive to it like you you ... what we need to do I think and this is part of the polarization that\nPolitics even as fewer and fewer people are identifying in political terms you know we're at historically low levels of identification as Republicans and Democrats of liberals and conservatives what these terms mean is now up for grabs it as it is leaking out of our life but some people but we are acting as if it's the\nThe thing that matters um and I think this is when I say we need a different type of conversation we need a conversation that is not simply about politics particularly electoral or partisan politics because\nPolitics is a zero sum game essentially him somebody wins and somebody loses in the winner gets to put their thumb in the eye of the people who lose this is a bad way to organize our everyday life there are parts where politics are absolutely important and and needs to be dealt with but\n... and and and another thing that's related to this is the rhetorical tactics so um for example I saw this week that at that guy who's running for governor of Florida I think it's Andrew Gillum his his name's that write\nThe Democrats deal in the Republican is\nWrong I think you think you think so he is ... is the rhetorical figure on that says I'm not saying I'm just saying\nWhich it's commonly associated with Trump a lot of people have paid attention to the way that he tries to prevent himself and being held accountable by saying you know I'm not saying this I'm just saying it right\nRight I hate to cut you short I know we're we're wrapping up I think you're referring to Andrew Gillum saying I'm not calling Ron dissenters racist I'm just saying that the racist think he's racist\nThat's exactly right and so you have both sides using the same ... the same technique\nAnd and and see you have to ask yourself are they using it for the same purpose right is it that purpose as saying something without being held accountable for it which would be demagogued act or is it a different strategy and and I think that there's probably a difference here\nLet me close with a comment from Beverly who emailed\nThe week of violence is a wakeup call for us I don't think the question to ask is who or what is responsible that way of putting it makes it easy for people who had fled mothers to say I'm not responsible for other people's actions the question to ask is what can each of us do to calm things down\nThat places the responsibility on all of us to reflect on our actions and words and make improvements were needed\nWe appreciate having had this time to reflect on some of the
