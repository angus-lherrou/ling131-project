welcome to one a it's such a gesture thank you for having me mark before we get into the details of Sergei scruples life I Wonder what you make of the story overall this kind of\nCaptured the world's attention why do you think that this got such international attention\nWell ... it's an outrage assigned to knit a to use that kind of substance on on the streets of a foreign city in order to secular school I think he's something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know in in both senses of that would that\nAnd extremely provocative saying but some people\nI think to have trouble believing the British Government narrative in all its details\nI have to say though you know as time has gone on on particularly things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects and then Russian journalist and expert it's working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season ends and then to link them so they Smith tree intelligence service the jail you ate old does seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what does it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ... or the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry\nAnd this is the same in quite a lot of countries that historically the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case you know changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russian civil war and the twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet than Russian general stuff has had this organization and ate embraces a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a ... kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... the

clearly there are other forms of poison uh and it was always intended to be absorbed through the skin\nAnd in a formulation actually that would absorb ... slowly very viscous formulation so that was the idea in in in in a sort of cold operational sense of what was used but undoubtedly as you implied\nOr with your question it it did carry a distinct signature of something that has been a developed some ... lab in southern Russia during the Soviet period\nAnd animals are quite distinctive in terms of its chemistry now in the early days off to the incident the Russians tried to claim all sorts of people from the checks to the Swedes to the British themselves Ukrainians much have made this\nA than they are sort of moved away from that law and then they don't tend to use it so much any more but I think if we look at this\nUm and we compare it for example to the case about ... who was a another former Russian intelligence officer who was\nWho was killed in London in two thousand ... string a different poison a radioactive isotopes ... to ... and\nThe ... on the nova chocolate very distinctive and you could say carried a Russian states and should they be substances that only a very very

A. M. U. dot org\nOut of ... before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of this show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend\nAre actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values that are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence that doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then he was the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talked to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program it's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listen to I mean I understand the idea about the division but\nIf you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize it yeah\nQuite frankly I think that that a behavior if exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um\nAnd it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging that's who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend ... please just remember the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that have had to been clarified or walk back so that's common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue believe mass referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... piece of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nI Know this is another kind of frustrating story from me Joshua because what we've got the the the root of this is a New York times article\nI'm about a leaked the administration memo and the New York times than not published this leaked memo they published an article about it that had a few direct quotes from it\nAnd a lot of those direct quotes actually lack either the word sex or gender\nThe word sex or gender occur and the New York times is owned copy and I would love to see how those terms are used in the memo itself because the New York times article almost team seemed to use them interchangeably an spots\nAnd that was really confusing to me and I would like to see if that's the confusion that is in the memo or if it's a confusion that happened in the writing process over at the times I'm Sorry I I guess I'm the media criticism guy but that's I don't know I don't even know what's what the story is yet because I haven't seen the memo and that frustrates me\nYou know that's that's worthwhile point Eugene and I guess you know that's kind of the challenge of\nOf reporting on both of these stories the immigrant caravan which is still kind of a possibility the potential change the ha just policy which I guess is a possibility because of the draft\nAnd also the president's tax plan which will discuss momentarily that these are ideas that have been floated that may or may not be real yes\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reactions were saying to these ideas um and and I wrote about the transgender issue earlier this week is that many people are assuming the worse based on what the president has administration have done in the past on issues related to transmit\nAnd are American ... algae beat the Americans that's a whole\nAnd immigrants and so uh I I think a lot of times uh people who have\nUh when it's a hear more from the administration and give the president the benefit of the doubt or have felt like his critics have not been operating in good faith um but all his critics have is what has been said and done in the past and a lot of times that it's put them in a position him\nNot to believe that whatever the president is trying to do it his mission of making America great does not include their groups as well\nMuch more to discuss as we continue is Eugene Scott at a reduced and Kathy Lohr still to come Georgia could become the first state in the nation with a black female governor democratic candidate Stacey Abrams faces a pitch to contest against her Republican opponent and opponent who just

in\nOn one day\nLet's get back to the friday news roundup conversation with Kathy Adam and Eugene using this is not the first time the Trump Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts\nOf reality start cheat when gender published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he has insulted our dignity this politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there what do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just can't you know it's\nBeen really fascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has to try to be at the table before her\nUm and and the the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps a for not a being a a boat advocate of the transgender\nA community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that one of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nThat seat back Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beats the communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention she saw people applaud and so she thought he would in bats algae beat the rights\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it was just one of those amazing moments in about how different Americans hear different things\nWhen we get to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending them for sex centers routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that when we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nKirk I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do with identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself\nAs one more story related to the ...
