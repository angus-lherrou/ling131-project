Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire before\nWe keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes and he meant what then you'll you just said there is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree\nNone and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that\nWell I think the main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to\nBringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that their lives to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure why I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak or and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper\nRecently the describes how over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nSo I actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in\nThe national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages\nAs employers compete for workers and we just haven't observe that overall ... after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins\nAre for example ... wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nA lot of millennials are eager to move to a bigger city to places with a little more urban density New Hampshire is gorgeous but it is very rural and it's not nearly as bustling all metropolis to see Boston\nHow much do you think the challenge here is just\nAnd I hate to be blind about this but New Hampshire being New Hampshire New Hampshire not being a place where young people are clamoring to be before we let you go how much is that just as a a built in challenge\nWell I Would argue that it's not really a challenge because really for young people everything is here they have a beautiful lifestyle every this state is designed for young people you can do anything you want out doors you know whether it's skiing or being at the lakes\nAnd there are a ton of young people really really into that lifestyle and as far as having cities and um you know communities to to be drawn to it look at places like port sniff conquered Manchester Nash what even in the western part of the state\nThere's some great small cities that have great options for young people whether um it's you know some kind of social life or other activities that they need to you know to have around them so they can feel connected that's on there I think the challenges and the rural sections of the state\nAnd finding that can activity when you're in you're a little bit further removed you have to find your people\nChristine cars the executive director of the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine thanks for talking to us thank you for having me\nSo if you move from your

comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slashed production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics didn't work out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turned over where there are chasing higher wages and and new facilities are new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us another one of our listeners tweets\nI hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to them their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt\nThat plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nYeah they come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but\nAt its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model and instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree\nBut only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really aren't home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those was family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of lake here I'm going to St Clair river um our largest out of court here on as a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did not have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county in headed out of Metra Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment and manatees are were small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\n[noise] yeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business any other sector\nWe realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nSo Randy told me how to come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair county

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing this story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump to in some of the arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nWhat area will just go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll give\nYou the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the guest said they've brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen him and typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but we've the people who've drawn the most attention of and the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you the that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear lose their favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke people are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of\nThe control is so tight Ted Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate\nHe even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably ah throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for art\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a mat seems like another ballgame\nIs to bring attention to the plight of migrants are but also to come to the United states and to seek um seek relief some some apply for asylum there's no question some will try to get into the country illegally\nOthers will kind of shrink a drop off on the way trying to get opportunities\nUm in Mexico for example is a is a massive issue it as a massive issue or for the president right now he is\nCompletely jumped on this issue trying to stir up a motion strip concerned this is obviously a two thousand sixteen issue a as well he ... you know he used a immigration as one of his signature issues if not the signature issue\nUm to take him to office and this caravan\nUh is is being used in that sense of saying look these tweets that he did yesterday blaming Democrats are blaming open borders or to the Democrats that I've spoke to they see this is largely\nA political move on to try to steer 'em responsibility away from his own policies because of some of the policies that you've got that was talked about just a minute ago have not been successful and camping down or clamping down on some of the migration\nTake family my ... family separation policy that really blew up in his face um you know trying to cut down on the border and the reality is we're saying we're back to kind of record number of migration coming to the\nAlexandra before we have to pause to the defense secretary did authorize deploying four thousand National Guard troops along the border\nI Wonder what we make about whether it was kind of a deployment with the hopes that the governor has refused to deploy these troops I mean what what was behind that\nI mean as Franco noted it's a bit of a political play on it sort of backs up Trump's promise with um at least an attempted action but the question is will that do anything will that change anything as Frank mentioned even though the Trump Administration has implemented stronger immigration policy it's\nThese border crossings are still coming and folks are still attempting to enter the country so at the end of the day it it seems like more of sort of a a PR move for a move to a back up the president rather than anything that will have an effect\nMore to discuss as we continue the friday news roundup was Alexander Jaffe Franco or juniors and Josh Rogers two big stories in
