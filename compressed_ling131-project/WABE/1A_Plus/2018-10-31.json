small D democratic point of view that's a good thing that the counter argument to that right is that like a campaign takes place over the course of this entire period\nAnd ah so there are things going on right up until election day that could in theory affect people's voting so when you allow people to vote early maybe they don't take account of all those things\nThe question from Dwayne who asked a Twitter Our early and absentee votes even counted on election day are the only counted if needed\nThat depends so um and in most cases yes they they are there are some places where again that they're really restrictive forms of of absentee voting only in other words the we're the only way that you can vote early is\nAbsentee in with a good excuse a those votes aren't necessarily going to be I counted until later if if it's close or will they will sorry I should correct myself they will all they will all be counted right right but they won't necessarily be counted on election day unless it's close\nUm however with a lot of these other states that they're counting them as they come in and their Web sites that you can go to and you can see the total is being updated regularly\nThere's another one of those reasons on election night to listen carefully to the coverage when they started giving returns because they will tell you state by state you know these are from the polls the early voting hasn't been routed yet there is a Twenty one day period where they double check like it's it's different from place to place\nThat's right and the other thing to to keep in mind and maybe this is one of the questions you're going to ask me but uh we expect in most cases especially at this point I when you look at the early voting numbers we expect to see a Republican advantage in those numbers a lot of Web sites have been looking at this and saying oh Gees may be the Democratic wave\nIsn't coming because look at the Republican numbers are a little bit stronger than the Democratic members but that's where you would expect to see with respect to mail votes and the earliest voters\nOne more comment from Sarah who emailed I vote early because it's such a

U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth\nSo a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an election just 'cause turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAre we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian grim at what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them or they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nProbably let me stick with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county is a way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out um it's\nSo it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nBrian grim it reporters from your station spoke to folks were casting early ballots in Johnson county Kansas a suburb of Kansas City here's what you heard from Sondra Kennedy who was voting early\nI Am I what you'd call I guess that conservative Christian [noise]\nI I just want to I just don't understand we're going [laughter] you know I just see that we're going down the wrong path\nWhen you have people coming to our country illegally I mean I have no problem with every ... some point so I have no problem with that\nIt's just illegal [noise] you know taking advantage of\nThe loop holes and taking advantage of the freebies that you know I just don't think that's right even when it come here and then you work hard and you pay for everything yourself\nSun for Kennedy a an early voter in suburban Kansas City in Johnson county Brian do you get a sense that a one party or other is benefiting the most stores the most motivated for early voting\nOr I don't know if there's a single party that's most motivated I mean when I look at the numbers surprisingly there\nThat there are more Republicans that have have done early voting but that would be expected in a in a state like Kansas that has more Republicans and Democrats but the number of the difference between them isn't as large as you would expect which which is quite interesting ah but they're they're they're definitely have been more Republicans that have turned out for early voting than than Democrats at this point\nBrian ... a reporter with Kay MU W in Wichita, Kansas thanks Bryan You're welcome Michael do you want a reporter with ... you

Kaufman dot org\nIs one day I'm Joshua Johnson what role does face play in bringing people together so worthwhile question especially after last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh\nAnd it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church back in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what she calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their face\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect\nPatients divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Joshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or tell us about your country\nCan sure we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City downtown Kansas City Missouri blue springs Missouri in a couple in the Kansas on and it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated\nWe have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nThe Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and\nDemocratic leaning independents are we ever were pretty divided congregation I think we represent the country\nYou know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader speak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you and talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about justice issues we're talking about\nPeople who are being hurt we're talking about moral issues we're talking about and and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on\nYou know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in a value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know tightening earlier I just do a sermon on this story of the garden of eat anything but politics yeah so\nHere's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in the ... and the Trump era there's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning and then again probably something morning and so what I've set is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these teams the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or what are the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical like you know lecture on ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I Try to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "31"}
