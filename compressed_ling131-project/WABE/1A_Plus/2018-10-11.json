calls Heather in Indianapolis is on the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage knowing that was not her comfort down knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one would find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for LA\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment it we can personalize it whether it's your interview or\nWhat have you and I think that was an important with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she was like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that alley billboard and he says we should have just made all billboard your nose\nThe thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive in Hollywood as far as it coming on the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe\nTen years ago I think the weirdest thing is placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also trying to end but by the way which for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be on on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go\nInto homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho was very much an invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nFor earlier versions of the film because that really reflects new dialogues uh about mental health about addiction about recovery and while I absolutely agree with the caller I also ah felt weird about that line about that it was his fault\nLike the fact that film engaged with the present day discussion of these issues which the other ones don't really\nYes definitely appreciate your calling into thanks very much for sharing that with us we also got some comments about that part of the story line from actually from several of you Karen wrote on our Facebook page I Would give it five stars\nBut I had to set aside my professional orientation ... I don't think says what her profession is I had to set aside my professional orientation as to how his addiction an obvious depression was enabled indoor ignored by those around him and just listen to the music\nThe demise of the male character was not handled so graphically in the previous versions of the movie and this was painful to watch I wanted to scream don't leave him alone at one point and look at the screen\nThe performances were incredible and who knew Andrew dice clay could have such a great second coming as a character actor I Want to talk about Andrew dice clay a little bit more when we come back to John horn I Do take this point from Karen and Stephanie about the portrayal of of substance abuse\nAnd I'm not saying that we can't help people who have addiction and I think part of the story in dealing with addiction and how crippling it can be is incredibly authentic and I think that's a ...\nTake away that you know you can be incredibly talented you can appear to outsiders to have it all and if you are fighting the disease as pernicious that's alcoholism it doesn't matter\nWhat you look like you're doing because it is destroying you from the inside and I think that's where the movie as most authentic about how horrible alcoholism can be he looks like ... everything and he doesn't because he can't conquered the street [noise]\nWant to get to some more of your questions and comments when we continue in just a moment we're speaking to John horn of frame NPR's empowers and Linda Holmes wanting it to a little bit more of the craft of film John spoke to the cinematographer of this will be ... but he got a comment about math you will get to that in a moment\nAnd even more fundamentally since we're talking about Bradley Cooper being first time director\nKathleen asked on our Facebook page basic question\nHow can you tell if the film is well direct\nQuestion Kathleen what can I ask for just a moment because [noise]\nKnow\n\n\nThis is one a with me Joshua Johnson on Ninety point one W.

horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born can you hear me\nYes I gave it to five stars which why five stars [noise]\nUm actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seems particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the irony of being discovered\nBecause she was a drunk and looking for a drink\nAnd their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually say and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned it's the part that her agent I guess he was her age at the guy who made her over\nThe manager Dan agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a ...\nWell in that whole relationship I\nJust I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah I'd I hear using a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard you trying to get his well\nNo that was a male nominee to go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um\nBut then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happened or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on states to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me it\nExactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending let's all go ahead and go as\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster is like the guy got what's called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS weren't have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then\nWas like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nYou who have been part of

earthquake and tsunami struck nearly two weeks ago\nAndrew thanks very much for contacting us through our app won a vox pop rate what would you say the Andrew\n... so we know that that is an attempt to distract of so when we when we think about why do we focus on black people the first thing that we can focus on the issue around police found has the violence and that doesn't mean that we don't care about the other issue so I can go to a breast cancer rally and that doesn't mean that I don't care about colon cancer just means that I'm focusing on this specific issue\nIn this way why focus on black people live at a we know that the disparities in the outcomes are just so bad for people of color that if we fix it for black people were actually automatically fix it for everybody else that like that makes sense\nI think that the other points to like you know where the cause of the violence and things like that it's like you know when I was in the street the only about I thought it was about to the police and like we wouldn't have been there the police and killed anybody and remember that like\nThe problem is a problem all across the country you think about California one in a lemon gun homicides and California's actually committed by police officer that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue\nAnd there are structural reasons that the police never get held accountable if you think about places like California where there's a law that says that literally any investigation of an opposite of last more than a year can never resolve the discipline regardless of the outcome in Cleveland they destroy a police officer disciplinary records every two years in Maryland my home town there's a lot and said that\nYou can find anonymous complaint gets an officer for everything except brutality so we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you guys are bringing their pain or the way I respond to his just always like ... back to what the facts aren't the second thing I think very quickly if\nI had no longer in really preachy about this stuff I Want to have other people I explained to me so you know when people tell me that social welfare programs are bad and like why are we just given people things it's like I had some\nLike what does a four year old has to do to earn dinner\nYou know like what does that mean your old have to do to be worthy of shelter like you tell me how they earn dinner right like I Want to hear them explain that to me like people say Mike Brown didn't have his hands up it's like ... dead today for supposedly Jay walking like you is that a consequence of with the police you know I'm going to a lot of panels that the police now say to me\nThere's a lot of crime crimes you know crimes bad uh are you saying the police you never kill somebody and I say to them like tell me when the police to kill your child like your kids going to make a mistake your kids going to do something than negatively impacts somebody else like what's the mistake that you'd be okay with the officer putting a bullet through your child and\nShe was like I don't know I'm like well a piano right so a part of

I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think of the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who are in the street in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember that we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started every\nBeing who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work and that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work is it I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom\nWithout you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people homes have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat a catalyst for the protest is just not a true there\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certainly leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause yes\nNobody is saying that the questions that are worthy question it's weird that leg or it's odd that like with policing the moment that you say like it's not working people like oh my God you must hate everybody it's like no I'm just saying it it just isn't working like that sort of just a true thing\nUm [noise] so it's interesting where the people who sort of defend them ... immediately defensive when you're literally just asking for a modicum of accountability Ninety seven percent of the officers who are involved in a any killings like aren't even charge Ninety nine I\nConvicted and like you saw it to you you are in about the bathroom gene being killed the where the Austin just walked into his house like that\nI don't that just doesn't seem right to me that's like very controversial yeah that just doesn't seem controversial that said that team right you've seen the videos like I've seen the videos and and like I won't accept that that's just collateral damage of what it means to be safe\nWhile I Know we we have to pause and just a moment where might step one be in terms of reform that people across the spectrum on this might be able to agree on before we asked for it\nI think it's like with the police you encountered coming with the laws that like it is it is basic about fairness and we started to sing a check to police that works that you can see in your city that clauses that they just aren't fair\nSo just being more active in terms of what the basic rules are the governed policing\nYeah like it's actually really hard to find out the ... the rules that allow police officers to shoot and kill people in the city is it's like so there's some places where like officers don't have to use any escalation did or the escalation like to kill people they literally the first interaction they can shoot you that's why\nThat doesn't make sense you know you can love the police and stuff like that\nWe have been spending a fair amount of time talking about the political will try to talk a little more personal with activist and author during the cats and when we come back\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nYeah\n\n[laughter]\nYou're listening to one a member supported Ninety point one W.

I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has that like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it ah the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew what ... not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a ... a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of constraint said like the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to have a magic things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like eating whether they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quite about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never seen any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote\nHow does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out very very\nUm [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know that doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with them and social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and you know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "11"}
