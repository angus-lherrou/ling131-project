police and like we wouldn't have been there the police and killed anybody and remember that like\nThe problem is a problem all across the country you think about California one in a lemon gun homicides and California's actually committed by police office and that's like\nThat's wild you know like this is a big issue\nAnd there are structural reasons that the police never get held accountable if you think about places like California where there's a law that says it literally any investigation of an opposite last more than a year can never resolve the discipline regardless of the outcome in Cleveland they destroy a police officer discipline a record every two years in Maryland my home town there's a lot and said that\nAh you can find anonymous complaint gets an officer for everything except brutality so when we hear these sort of deflecting like you know why are you guys doing this you guys are bringing their pain\nThe way I respond to is always like ... back to what

or\nAre you saying the police you never kill somebody\nAnd I say to them like tell me when the police to kill your child like your kids going to make a mistake your kids going to do something then

I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nCertainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who are industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we went to see for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis who organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest\nOr so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that uh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person\nAnd bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the the people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYeah so it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nYeah that just doesn't seem controversial that sentence team right you've seen the videos like I've seen the videos and and like I won't accept that that's just collateral damage of what it means to be safe\nWhile I Know we we have to pause and just a moment but where might step one be in terms of reform that people across the spectrum on this might be able to agree on before we have to break\nI think it's like with the police you encounter someone with the laws I like it is it is basic about fairness and we started to sing a check to police that works that you can see in your city that clauses that they just aren't fair\nSo just being more active in terms of what the basic rules are the govern policing\nYeah like it's actually really hard to find out the ... the rules that allow police officers to shoot and kill people in the city is it's like so there's some places where like officers don't have to use any escalation did or the escalation like to kill people they literally the first interaction they can just shoot you that's why if that doesn't make sense you know you can love the police and stuff like that since\nWe have been spending a fair amount of time talking about the political will try to talk a little more personal was

I Can't remember now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that are bringing ... what does it mean to be worthy\nThat if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave and I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities are there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass woman not asked for I knew\nThat when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints somebody that can strengths become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to imagine things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my eating by the diversity in the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never eaten any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons I've important for me to be out and very very\nUm [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of over it way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this where it publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd uh you know I I Walk into every room as a black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nThat I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm\nSo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHave to tell

A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to ...\nYeah I just wanted to lead to mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax a on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of this because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the I PCC set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really ... very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trainer and a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not in my account um he tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point I might have caught on me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShe Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand I disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you hard in your home and if you want to live in Florida but as he will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall had to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town could own incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one\nReally tough and when we're we're we're we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\nTheir existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coast one to one we're talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious progress\nSound choices about survivor ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and but I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... ... one small point just to and if you think that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict it means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nAbsolutely you know I think Trump recognizes that this is going to be a rallying cry for the Democrats not just in the mid term that looking at it had to twenty twenty\nAnd this is something that here in California at us and Eric Harris and is out front on talking about it um and she's actually the first person could back Senator Sanders on this last year at least publicly new avenues English running for governor\nOr on the Democratic ticket and mediate Lee ... act to strike down at ... at comments in this ad and he talked about Trump support for the grand ... allowed insurance to charge more\nFor pre existing conditions is is absolutely something that gathering incentives riding on he wants to government run health care system and Trump actually called him out in Montana\nA couple of weeks ago on this thing not only does news that wind chat universal healthcare he also why fit to apply to undocumented immigrants had kept trying jokes he may even move here to California to get their free health care\nOr story would like to start getting into before we have to pause and there has to do with the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh he was confirmed Saturday in fifty to forty eight Senate vote sworn in as a justice over the weekend and on Monday in a ceremonial swearing in with the justice is family by his son listen\nTo him\n\nWhat I was\nPart of the swearing in ceremony for the newest\nIn court justice Brett Kavanaugh his confirmation to the Supreme Court comes after a month long battle between Democrats and Republicans over that nomination we'd like to talk more about how that confirmation\nHas resonated across the country and frankly whether this fight is over some senators are vowing to continue that fight against Kavanaugh so what would be their next move will get into that and we continue our conversation with political journalists Todd's will like Shane Harris intelligence and

A. M. U. dot org touch well look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nSeems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "12"}
