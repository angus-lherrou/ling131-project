Myre is Vivian ... of the wall Street Journal and David Sanger of the New York times with regard to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country\nHow can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty David what do you think well\nCyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it has happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on from there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet but\nBeyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyber attacks the world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of the you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with us here on\nOther thing that we've seen in the last couple of days is coordination as hum indictments and you know raising concerns about on science\nOtherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many uh\nRestrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats and as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have\nUm we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us in the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nFor its funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of outrage helped so why it helps insulated from ... to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know ... but but the key element here as we've done a better job at\nDiscussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nWorse noting California's highest point as mount with me which is Fifteen thousand feet a Arizona's highest point Humphrey speaks about twelve thousand six hundred feet Alaska's highest point mount McKinley Denali national park twenty thousand feet so I think we could survive\nInto a just a guess I think I think we got like a mask or oxygen tanks and so we can figure let's be fair journalists are not the fittest group but as for yourself Greg Myre is\nNot please don't vote in ... I Would love to I Would be terrified but I Would give her shots\nLet's move on and talk about Iran after the Trump Administration abandoned that nuclear deal negotiate I'm Sorry I actually before we get to Iran one more comment David that I'd like you to react to regarding China Chuck you fall you wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nOh it's China that's meddling in our politics not the guy's hacking including and nova ...\nThat's a relief yeah well that the biggest problem with the ... speech was not what he said it's what he didn't say so she could go back to the national security strategy that the administration turned out in January it referred to to revisionist powers Russia and China\nThey're very different Russia is declining economy it's got a you know all kinds of of growth and survival issues of its own but it's a huge disruptor and of course a major nuclear power in China you have a rising power and you've got the classic clash between the ...\nPower and the status quo power that would be ... ... it's sort of what we went through with the British a hundred and fifty years ago\nSo the question now is why does the administration just focus on the Chinese part of this and not on the Russian part and that gets to all of your favorite theories about what what reason Donald Trump may have for not being critical of a of a lot of ...\nI I agree with Vivian that the base issues that he's raising with China are absolutely right he's over invested in the personal relationship both in the case of fusion bang and of course with\nA with Kim Jong are much more to come to the front of news roundup continues with David Sanger Greg Myre ... will get some more of your questions and thoughts in just a moment to\nGet some but do we not\nI'm a gay\nI met somebody when I moved out to eat them\nMan a man and\nMe no no no no\nUh uh uh [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm Joshua Johnson you are listening to one day on Ninety point one W.
