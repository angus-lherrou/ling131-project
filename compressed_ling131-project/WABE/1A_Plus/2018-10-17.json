actors who do that today that's different from Americans who were genuinely\nConfused about the issue and need to be informed and need to be reached culturally\nWhere they live and I think that's an important point the second thing I'll say is that it's time we injected some American can do spirit into this discussion\nWhen John Kennedy was confronted with the space race in the Cold War he

denying\nA problem that is threatening the safety and welfare of the American people sometimes we have to say like it is Joshua we can't sugar coat the truth when we come to the American people's safety security and economic future Sarah\nI Know we've got a positive but it but it's Paul right in my being a little bit too forgiving in terms of the way we talk about the president\nI mean my view is that we need to indict publicly years who are trafficking in science denial as a form of misconduct and a form of putting the American public in to danger however I Do think that we as scientists have engaged\nNonstop in trying to confront denialism and often that engagement is a very it's coded male power brokering that is very problematic in the culture because it pits people against each other instead of focusing on shared values\nLike you want to focus on some of more of our shared values and how we talk about climate change as we continue with Sarah ... of the role and Institute and Paul Bledsoe American University's Center for environmental policy we also heard from some of you've seen the damage from hurricane Michael and how that affected your view of the discussion with

A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSome of you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes

the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\n... wrote that state and I am in a room and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and teaching about\nClimate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are just regular people who might not have the education that I had\nAbout climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all\nThis ... it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible\nBut when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinion\nOn climate Katie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening changed the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through on through relationship and trust and empathy um because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nAnd what are the ... why our voices being eliminated from the public forum why do we have such a a partisan distorted narrative\nBut it is harder pointing out that this is a U.S phenomena sure the part as they shouldn't have climate change is not a global phenomenon\nIt doesn't exist in most of the world and we need to reflect on the U.S political and cultural system right now in our norms and and do some honest thinking about\nAre we being manipulated by people who have self interest that aren't\nMatching up with the long term self interest of the American people which is what many of us believe is happening this is a U.S problem almost uniquely and its political and cultural aspects\nI Would agree with that but I just want to reflect back again that the entire world by and large and the world's global resources are run by men and those decisions are made by a man and so one of the fundamental aspects of solutions for climate change has to do with anti racism\nAnd an anti ... and that is that a global level is that the closer we get to on an equitable and safe society for every one specifically for the rights of girls and women then that's a component of the pathway for us to get the orders of remind added options there\nIs a little more with this I'd like to discuss I Know we have to pause will finish this up on the other side of the breakout like us to kind of do a lot\nBut of role playing of what you can see the folks in certain\nKinds of debates to some of the more common objections including like just that being or cycles are where does a science come from we also got a good question is Marlene who wrote on our website the one eight dot org so if you change people's minds what then\nI see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their own make mention houses with the thermostat turned out not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's\nLike it's someone else's tomorrow not ours interesting point Arlene even if you win the argument what do you do to turn the argument into action and if you haven't done that does that mean your argument failed that's ahead because\n[noise]\n\nIf you were like us You're probably already talking about mid term elections because while they're important\nDemocrat here can't figure out the right way to campaign against the Republican late night and with Republicans in control of the federal

shut you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you

owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few common objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those protections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of protections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting or the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas analogy of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so\nWe do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we

A. M. U. dot board we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but ... broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a retired\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long art and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hundred bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture\nAre there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what other kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money they make\nMoney off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with them mugging titled meant like they've lived the life of a native\nLike somebody's ever called them an engine or a or word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nShould know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today\nThat we did a discussion about the use DNA testing kids the ones that say find nurture ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nAdam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what they can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one daughter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a ... Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help me to issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on this\nWhat do you think is going to happen carry in this in the Senate race in for the issue at large I hate to ask you to to forecast the future but what does the trend look like what are people kind of expecting from this race\nWell if we pull out the ... [laughter] I think I think it's really hard to know look it's um the polls have Kramer are solidly ahead of hike camp um polls have been wrong before polls were wrong in twenty twelve when Senator hike camp one and I would draw your attention in North Dakota to the math\nTypically between two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred and fifty thousand people in the ST turn out to vote in federal elections what that will be this year I'm not exactly sure at presumably on the high side for mid term but that's about the range of people were talking about so it doesn't take much to to change an election\nPlenty we have to pause and just a moment but mark what are you seeing in North Dakota where do you think this has had\nWell I think this will make it a lot closer than it would have been I think it would have been very one sided election before this all happened so whether it will be enough or not for us that are kept to win re election I don't know but I think it would not have been a contest that this stuff\nAnd Simon ... Smith I Know we have to let you go momentarily but what do you see as the as the outlook for this going forward\nThink uh you know I have to agree with mark I think it's going to galvanize so many indigenous people that are going to go out there and I think that you're going to have a swell of indigenous people hitting the polls and I'm telling them no you can't take my vote you know my my voice matters are voice matters where the original people of this land we're stewards of this land and you're not going to take our our rights\nAway from us do you feel more or just feel like this is something that's that's a a growing groundswell among Native American voters across the country this issue of voter disenfranchisement\n[noise] oh yeah most definitely and I think a especially under this this rotten administration\nA lot of indigenous peoples are going to come out to vote and especially to get all of them out we saw how it played out with people like you know when they were trying to get Kavanaugh and then they finally got cabin I and and we're like no this is this is horrible and this is happening on our watch as indigenous people were not going to let that happen\nSome employers Smith a Chicano writer and reporter uh CNN contributor and also in a global Lakota citizen working on a book coming out next year\nAbout his experiences as a Native American in the twenty first century Simon it's been a pleasure to have you with us thanks for talking to his ex for having me we'll continue our conversation in just a moment with mark ... and Kerry levine and we'd still love to get to see more of your questions and thoughts as well about being a Native American voter and the issues that matter to you in the mid term one eight at\nW.
