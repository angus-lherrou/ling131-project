R. E. machine which is what we have right now you should always have a paper audit trail\nAnd in Georgia we have not had that and that's why when we update the new voting machines we need to make sure that we have a paper ballot system that's in place so that people have something that they can actually look touching feel when they go back to do a recount so that's very important\nAnd then they also talked about the absentee about process and how to strengthen that\nThat's very interesting reading the the history of President Jimmy Carter and how you became a state senator and the\nFolks that a try to really stuffed ballot box so he wouldn't become a state senator and that was one of those really Democrat versus Democrat but it's just a great history lesson and that's why I really what he's done at the Carter center is and that's why he care so much about having clean fair elections and our support that also\nWhat was your effort I Want to stay with you because it in the order of this way I Would be starting with you as it relates to security which you've just been talking about we know that Georgia election officials were warned almost two years ago that the state's electronic voting system could easily breached\nIs the lead to sex or state what immediately would you do to implement better security measures I mean you talked about in terms of the actual elections having a paper trail but what about the overall system well\nIt's it's several components really it's first of all your the confidential voter database that needs to be secured and that's one that's one conversation and the second the first part of that conversation with voting machines\nAre believed that coming out of state commission we're going to get recommendations I Believe that general assembly the sense of the general assembly is to pass legislation to fund a new voting machines and not make it so much so specific but given a platform a guideline of ... what they need to have what are the guard rails it\nAnd we'll put that out to bed low qualified better\nGet those purchased and get those up and running my goal is to have those up and running for the next election and twenty Nineteen when we have our local elections\nBecause that's our trial run because generally for local elections that come from a city council background you get five six percent of the population that's a great way to do a trial run then we're ready for the presidential primary twenty twenty and then for the twenty twenty up new voting machines [noise]\nTime probably won't let me get dig into really cyber security ... make sure that we maintain the security of our voter database that is critical when you think that Facebook hack last week was fifty million you know people their informations out there and also one of the credit reporting agencies based in Atlanta\nHad over one third of all American Social Security numbers out their hackers never sleep and nor can I\nWas a barrel if elected as Georgia's next after state would immediately do you want to do in terms of implementing better security measures\nLike Rome I've already called for it back in January of this year I call for us to follow Georgia law as it is currently written as it was written in two thousand and two when he bought these machines\nAnd call for a process to certify these machines in accordance with the procedure outlawed in state law because it has been proven to the satisfaction of the public\nAnd to the courts that these machines can be hacked at that time I called the certification process began while the general assembly was in session and when we could have gotten the resources to get the supplemental machines that are really use optical scanners to count\nAnd march paper ballots and pleased that slice\nJoined me later this year in July of this year he joined in the cold and I made back in February of two calls that he certification these machines and well Brad says it's his goal to have these machines in place for the next election it's been this policy up till now to do nothing to call for that in this year's election when there was time to do it\nThe court that recently passed on an opportunity\nDoes this did so because it wasn't enough time to do it but there was time back in February there was time in July and but it's been the policy of my opponent on the Republican side to do everything possible to whistle past the graveyard pretend this issue is not revealed to have your head in the sand in the courts language until after this election\nWe should have some leadership on this area\nHe is a part of the legislature that supposed to make sure the secretary of state is doing his job and following the law the secretary of state supposed to the job of telling the legislature when these things have to be retired there's been a failure of leadership on both sides and my Republican opponent was to continue that policy of failure of leadership in the next ... minutes ration that needs to change\nMistrust when you can respond ... because he didn't mention about\nThe court has ruled that we're going to be using these voting machines\nSo that has been cast ... my commitment is and I believe the commitment the gentle suddenly have new voting machines for next year because they don't they will be used uh with the existing machine so I think they understand that time to make the changes now\nThe government a state of Georgia has I guess a comeback out of the great recession so we've just fully fund the cube III we'd have\nThe right to build the rainy day fund is now it's time and so you know we will have new voting machines for twenty nine to\n... should devalue mentioned that you have experienced an IT field so data security cyber security if you are let the secretary of state what's the first measure you would like to implement if you can as it relates to Georgia voting system and overall the security of all the voters and all the information that ... that's held within the secretary of state's office where I Would get me started\nOkay fair of um you know the for the for the listeners about two and a half weeks ago there was a federal court case of a coalition of good government I sued Brian Kemp and the secretary of state's office about the security and not taking seriously the threat that we have\nAnd just to position this for ... off fireworks um there's been a threat for many many years these machines that voting machines we have now have not been patched or anything for many many years I should have been replaced eight years ago at minimum okay\nBut the thing that we're at now is that Barry had in this than the secretary of state has been negligent\nAnd doing this this job\nYou know right at the money is the rest of my time to tell what Georgia voters needed to know because we should have to certify there's machines John Barrow is exactly right we should have to certify them I changed my mind wants it came in the press the Russians\nWere analyzing our Web sites that escalated the risk priority and it is time to take action Georgia voters if what you need to do is go out and apply to request an absentee paper ballot request an absentee paper ballot when you get a ballot\nConflict of interest in Democrats and Republicans having this office so that the question I have for you is yesterday your responses is that you didn't think it was possible for you know a third it'd be a nonpartisan put in in this position\nAnd uh yet I'm running this year I'm sitting right beside you um you know\nWouldn't you think that I Would be the best person for this job not only for the people of Georgia but also for a Republican [noise]\nNo I I Believe I'm the best person for this job that's high running for it [laughter] so\nThe case closed but what I said yesterday is that you make a case on other way should the secretary of state's office be elected or should be appointed by the governor\nAnd so first of all people need to realize that the way the constitution set up in Georgia we have a very powerful former governor so in effect what you're doing but they gave me even more power to the governor many people do not realize that it wasn't only until the Nineteen sixties\nThat the state house actually started picking their speaker of the house\nUntil that time the governor's had always pick the the speakers of the house so they've got the fact that power [noise]\nAnd uh I'm sure that the speaker Austin's very happy with that and so it was every other speaker since that point but the point is is that we have a very powerful form or do you want to give that more power to a governor whoever that is whatever party but also a governor if he is elected or she is elected\nDemocrat or Republican or whatever party is probably going to pick someone with the same mindset and say share the same principle in other words that can be from the same party\nSo it's really just something at the end of the day it will still be someone who shares the same Republican or Democrat leanings I Believe that what it is in a partisan position when you're having a Democrat run a Republican or a libertarian run\nThen you know what they stand for and if they do a bad job I guess what in four years she can throw him out of office\nMr berry you have an option you can ask another candidate question or if he wanted to follow up from the last conversation you can moderator privilege I Will allow that\nHow about if I Do both out just to say the reason for not paying taxes this year is because there's a provision of the law says it hadn't been term about quarter of a law that you owe the taxes then you can not you're not disqualified\nAnd that's a that's basically to provide a safety valve for people who commit a mistake and who ... I didn't know about this kind of problem and they can take care of it without being disqualified brand new abide and eleven nobody in Fifteen delighted and Eighteen we ought to have somebody to do the right thing that when they're forced to do it but I Want to ask a question just mice\nNot spice libertarian candidate frequently don't get the respect that they do their ... oftentimes overlooked by and ignored by people say my opponent referring to the you know the other party's nominee I'm gonna treat you with a certain amount of respect and since you and I both believe in rank voting I'm gonna ask you a ranked voting question All right\nYou and I both support getting rid of these the already machines this year we both called for\nYou and I both support making the secretary of state's office nonpartisan ended a genuine a nonpartisan fashion so it'll stay that way despite the at the ... the distractions posed by by reading his characterization of the alternative\nYou and I both believe in gerrymandering reform you and I both believe in hand mark ballots with optical scanners you and I believe in rank voting a number of other reforms now I Want you to assume\nThat there's going to be a run off in this election and unfortunately you're not going to be in it if there was a run off between me and my Republican opponent which one would you support on the grounds of election reform well\nYou so much a first thing I I really appreciate a appreciate that thank you very much ah\nI disagree with the premise of your question in the sense that I might not be in the run off because I'm offering Georgia vote or something they don't have right now and that is the head of anti I understand that I got to finish talking about you know an act genuine change and you're not going to get genuine change from a you know\nI mean you guys are both guys of integrity but when it comes right down to it you all serve the your parties and is the weather when it comes down to whether it's your party is going to get ahead or whether it's going to be in the best ... uh you know uh for the people of Georgia you serve your parties and that's been proven time and time again\nRight choice voting you know that is that is a no brainer\nAnd I am very happy to hear it or what I Would like to hear from you know\nA Democrat leadership or from Republican leadership or for those who are sick and tired of Democrats and Republicans is is that we start putting things in place like rent choice voting so that we moved beyond this partisanship this awful awful partisanship that we have because there is no future in it\nThere's absolutely no future in and how we are running this country right now\nAnd we need to change that ran choice voting it'd be a absolute wonderful thing for Georgia\nThe county's would save millions of dollars and run saving money on runoff expenses and we would increase competition political competition that would benefit everyone especially our communities thank you Mr Duval stresses\nQuestion to fellow candidates [noise]\nJust to Mr Deval why do you support\nHaving a ... district and commission and taking the power away from the general assembly to select the districts [noise]\nYou know that is a great question so the I'm all for listeners out there where he talked about gerrymandering what we're talking about\nIs the ability to draw district lines\nAnd right now on the Republican Party in the state of Georgia has drawn a line to favor their party when the Democrats were in power in the early to thousands of age drew it into a favor of their party and what happens is that they are the politicians are picking the voters the voters are not picking the politicians\nThis is such a serious serious issues that we've had three cases in front of the Supreme Court this year I don't think that there is a great solution with this in terms of single member districts but at the same time it is something that we must challenge\nWith twenty first century gerrymandering that's the power of computers All right and you have\nThe all the data from Facebook from Google and you have the powerful mapping software and the predictability voters you can draw a district through people's backyards down the streets you can select voters with precision and it's a possible now for\nGerrymandering map makers to create a permanent majority party and a permanent minority party\nAnd all they have to do is have control of those maps\nThis is an integrity issue to representative democracy we must tackle gerrymandered boosted it probably you have one more question that they asked us hello can you know I think you are yes I'm so\nJohn similar question to what I was asking I'm a ... um yesterday Veronica waters or ask question about whether the secretary of state's office should be a nonpartisan office and I'm I'm choosing this question because I was a very delighted this question's actually coming up in this race\nUm you know\nThere is a conflict of interest um and Democrats and Republicans I'm using their partisan advantage um gerrymandering was a perfect case voter suppression is about a perfect case\nYesterday you agreed with me I'm Alan today on the show you agreed with me that uh there should be a non partisan office so wouldn't it follow that given that I'm neither Democrat or Republican that I'm the best choice for this up for this office\nYou're very kind to pose it that way but you are a partisan candidate represent your party and the party of as as a group of people who align themselves to advance of political cause here's the calls we can agree on\nAnd it's something that bred disagrees with us on this office ought to be a non partisan office\nBut yesterday you heard him give the usual distraction while we can't really make it nonpartisan 'cause if it's ever filled by the voters on that basis well there's always a vacancy and you get a real partisan governors don't feel that vacancy and before you know what the dice are loaded kind of like with our courts\nI address that problem yesterday\nAnd it was ignored by Brad today if you really want this to be a non partisan office\nAnd he was elected on a nonpartisan ballot in in the usual manner but you require that it'd be filled by that manner exclusively so that there ever is a vacancy in that office through death of disqualification or whatever\nThen the voters will choose the successor in precisely the same manner as they chose the predecessor this is how it is done\nFor the United States House of representatives it is the only body and federal government that cannot be appointed by anybody you can only be filled by a vote of the electors\nSame with our representatives and the general assembly and if they really believe this office which has a lot of election issues to dispose of can can and should be operated in a non partisan fashion there's only two ways to do this make it really nonpartisan for\nBest thing yet find the most bipartisan person out there to do the job and I got that going away in spades in this election because I have the record of being the most bipartisan
