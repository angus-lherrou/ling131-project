secretary of state take a listen to this nearly Seventy thousand in person balance your counties with the top five highest turnouts Fulton County with just over twelve thousand the cab with over ten thousand ... over nine thousand\n... over seven thousand and Clayton over four thousand now there is a bit of a controversial regarding a group of African American senior citizens traveling to vote in Jefferson County yesterday\nBecause they never made it to the polls why won't organizers from the group black voters matter they're calling it voter suppression now the senior citizens were traveling in a black voters matter tour bus\nFrom the Jefferson County leaders center to cast their ballots allowing the way organizers from the group say the ... and I'm quoting here someone had complained to the Jefferson County commission organizers told the media outlet think progress that they aren't sure who complain about their\nBut that the bus full of about forty senior citizens what turned around a closer look confirmed these advance what they represent if from black voters matter a representative from the county commission told things progress they never received a call complain about the black voters matters activity closer look made several calls it a leisure center and the county commission\nAnd maybe it's where I Am in life but my kids are older\nThan most of them I said to my son if you played for the hawks you'd be the oldest player except for events young they're young they're young and they have a lot of money and they also have a lot of idle time up to Eighteen twenty hours a day and so you have\nTo be taught you have to train yourself to be a professional and to do the things that take care of yourself and we built a brand new training facility with\nOur partnership at Emory that gives them a place that they can enhance or you know their bodies and their minds and it deals with their nutrition so we're we're in a holistic taking care of\nAll of the players life rather than just look at them as assets to trade and move\nLife skills are so important I remember a very good friend of mine he's now passed on can Hudson who was on the first African American men at the referee in the NBA and he talked about how he would mentor players and how he was traveling with the team and it was a young player and he gave to player gave his credit cards the bellhop because he did not just he didn't know how to check and he didn't know\nThe process and and you know you look at that and say wow I Can't even say you know rose you have to understand these kids are coming out of college those that were coming out of college they don't know about what it means now to wake up and be a millionaire [noise]\nThey don't know certain life skills and said you have to say if you're going to be a coach and he said red Auerbach told them that if you're going to be ... you have to be willing to be a father figure sometimes\nAbsolutely I worked with Kenny uh Turner off yeah you know and he literally understood and could connect to these players and it's important you know I Want ...\nPlaying for the hawks to mean something in the NBA community and not for what you earn but for what you do and being connected to a community I'm a native land and and my motivation for being here was community what I\nYou know have been very very fortunate that I've been able to work in a fairly significant jobs with really nice companies in Atlanta\nBut sports can galvanize the community sports can bring a community together better than any politician or policy so when you do it right which we haven't quite gotten there yet but we're making strides you you're a community asset and you touch people's lives in the most positive way\nAnd speaking of a positive way you all have a pretty fancy renovated arena that's pretty positive now the state farm arena hundred Ninety two million dollar transformation in what is this high definition video that you all say will enhance the endgame experience so wedded my flat screen ow ow you killed your [laughter]\nI um I just came from the arena to come here and whoa\nWe live in a world of screens yes me too you know we grew up looking at a TV screen and it was static and it didn't have anything but three or four channels and then it became the explosion of cable and so when the architects came to us they brought us is very unusual\nSchool idea that we wouldn't have a center hunger scoreboard that we'd have for video pavilions one in each corner so people could look to the writer they're left and have a great deal\nAnd we said that's really interesting we need to think about it 'cause when you do something that's so non traditional you're taking a risk and in the middle of the night and it was obvious\nOne of the reasons we had to renovate are building 'cause there was a risk we had all the premium on one side in a city that the best part of it as inclusion and diversity we had a division you can't come over here you don't have a ticket and so we said\nLet's do this let's keep the for video pavilions and let's add and incredible scoreboard in the middle and that's what we did so we have more a video screen square footage pixels which a lot of people don't understand I Can't tell you I'm One of them who do than any other building in the NBA\nAnd so you're telling me Steve calling and writing a closer look that regardless of the the ... that the price of your ticket when you come into this new State Farm arena you will get an experience just maybe you won't get anywhere else in the in the NBA because you have all these screens going to make it\nAbsolutely right there on the court is the first of all we have seven rose off the upper deck to make that a better experience we built a new upper deck the chick fillet fans on\nThat um I think is one of the highlights of the building and and we wanted to celebrate Atlanta when we did this building so we um we're the first NBA arena may probably the first sports arena\nThat we got with killer Mike and we built a sweatshop we have a barber shop swag shave wash and groom overlooking the court for terrorists can get your hair cut and watch the game\nI get a said watch the gaps in our minds to\nAtlanta the barber shop poachers a huge part of China\nMy first job as a kid was delivering Barbara beauty supplies as a twelve year old with a guy who had a business every Saturday I'd go run around with them and put stuff in the boxes and there was all going downtown and to to urban areas and the barber shop\nI learned also at Turner and the beauty salons when we marketed it TBS Tyler Perry show how influential on how important that piece was so we wanted something in the arena that symbolized\nAbout big piece of that line and we also wanted to celebrate the music component with killer Mike and then we built a twenty thousand square foot unbelievable restaurant bar with Atlantis background that will be in our concert north ends on\nWith all these with this upgrade and that's clear this because you know they're always rumors without the upgrade was this franchise looking to relocate and all you know you guys for the knife largest city in America we want to leave and large list the Braves went up the street so that they didn't leave Atlanta around me that they know\nTechnically they did yeah would we um you know I mean it just never was on\nBecause you see this connection with Atlanta\nAtlanta is one of the great NBA markets my job to make it a great Elana hawks margin every morning when I Would get ratings from NBA on TNT mine was the top five marketing and its income grew in how do we love\nThe NBA but not all of our home team and part of it it's nobody's from here [laughter] that's part of it is they weren't part of the community for the last fifty years and part of it was that people didn't have faith an ownership that prove themselves out it's not worth ... being trustworthy and those days are changing\nOnly professional team as you know goes beyond what you present on the field um and you know that the leagues have had to adjust because listen fan habits change so if you could what would you change anything about the NBA that you think as a ... that they need to adjust to let it relates to the fan habits [laughter] well it's\nThe building we just built as the next generation building the idea of coming and getting to ... feet having ... you know a hotdog served you in an aluminum foil wrapper with a watered down beer or soft drink something happened today and so\nThe NBA I made a big big social media investment different than other sports and we let you can basically watch a game on Twitter you really can and we let that happen because we grew the base\nBruce the fans rather than holding on to all the media because we wanted to make a dime and so I think the NBA has done a lot of things that said I Would be shocked in ten years if baseball there and have shorter games and if we didn't have shorter games\nPeriod in eighty two season\nNow for set of forty eight minutes maybe forty really I wouldn't be surprised ... forty minutes\nIn your fans of say well listen I'm I'm paying top dollar I hate the guys I and you know even though I didn't see our sweat now let's see but it's not like for ten minutes then\nAgain I'm hypothesize [laughter] and I will tell you in forty minutes he's still sweat [laughter] actually the stars could play more yeah\nSpeaking of than habits four years ago when you were brought into this role it was a terrible time for them ... listens really clear and then maybe deservedly so\nWith the\nAnytime race or racism is brought into any environment any space\nWhat was your approach and trying to maneuver through all of that because it was ugly\nWell I was here six weeks\nIf I had no history if I would've known for the state attorney and been really apple of course [laughter] and you know at its core was some out of touch people trying to hurt each other at its core\nThat really believed and didn't understand that land and that's the big piece here if you understand this city nobody scares any body nobody keeps anybody it's the best one were altogether\nForty six percent of our ticket buyers for the Atlanta Hawks are African American ... the number two team in the league is the Washington Wizards at nine percent so that's the different that's a different wow so you celebrate who we are\nYou promote who we are and you create inclusion and comfort and you you\nDo everything you can to embrace communities and that's what we've done we've invested in communities we've connected one of the first things I did was um three of our top seven executives are African American women with Keith title which didn't exist in doesn't exist in sports\nAnd it was about having diversity of thought diversity of gender and more importantly we need to represent the city that we were on our test\nDiversity and inclusion are great\nAnd I I'm just coming off listening to the Angela Davis gave a lecture and she says when it was very interesting she said you know diversity and inclusion is great but\nI go to the game to see you remember that moment when Moroccan Michelle Nunn a kid I Lived for those kind of moments the sports I Can't I don't like to know can we bring feedback and am I going to be on the folks don't even know why\nBut I'm not going to be that people anybody who's nosy if you were here you would see that rose rocks out to the music they got what I'm hearing of your music and Lois does the same thing

Americans for the arts dot org [noise]\nCloudy skies at sixty nine degrees welcome to this Wednesday edition of closer look I'm Rose Scott we'll begin with this yet another poll has been released in fact\nTwo new polls from the University of Virginia's Center for politics it shows close races in two high profile open seats southern contests a tendency Senate race and George's gubernatorial race between sector of state Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams\nNow according to the ... it's just UVA Center for politics poll camp neighbors are basically tied with camp at forty seven percent in ... that forty six percent now this online poll was conducted in English from October forth to the eleventh and respond it's we're likely Georgia voters some other findings the top issues for Georgia voters\nHealthcare come in at Seventeen percent and the economy at sixteen percent and according to the polls relates to healthcare\nForty three percent of those likely voters feel that Abrams as the better policy as opposed to thirty eight percent for Kim they're more numbers for immigration forty six percent field at camp as a better policy compared to thirty six percent filled it\nIt was at a better policy you falling all these numbers folks and among those likely Georgia voters fifty one percent say they approve the way president Donald Trump is handling his job well forty eight percent say they disapprove\nClasses for the year just put up some extra ones the other week and they are already failed so\nPeople realize that this is really worthwhile and and that they want to to do this work and so that that\nUh reconstructing the work started are getting us notoriety around the country and before I knew it people were calling me from all over the place where people come in here from Chicago in from New Orleans from the Episcopal communities saying help\nUs figure out how to get out of work going with more life\nAnd so who are the participants in the workshop are they mostly people face from within the Episcopal community\nAnybody who's a leader in the Episcopal Church so and priests and deacons have cannot be ordained until they've taken this work\nAnd they get a great like no no they just get credit for having done it and that ... that can make gave me a sea [laughter] no they don't get grades it's it's not great but um [noise]\nSo anybody who is some of that street member which is the leaders of the way our church leadership works or if you're on a search committee really if you're a Sunday school teacher if your parents administrators any job that you have that's considered to be leadership you are supposed to take\nThis Maryland racism class because the idea was to get the leaders\nUp to speed so they can then I'll get the parishes up to speed and\nSo so our focus I mean we're ... our focus as it appears couple constituency but we've had people come\nFrom the Methodist Church we've had a high people come we have had an atheist come to our classes because they've heard about the classes and they wanted to come and we don't we're not going to turn anybody away so anybody who wants to come as welcome but we don't promote the work\nOutside of our own constituency because we have fifty six thousand Episcopalian in Atlanta so I used to tell the commission that's a big enough constituency for me if we can impact that group I'll be happy the commission morphed into the center because we outgrew being a commission\nWe were doing all this work all over the country and just a little group of volunteers\nAnd so the bishops said you know you all of outgrown being a commission and I said you know you're right we have and I was just I was falling tearing I I was not being paid nobody was being paid would end and I was working like forty fifty hours a week as a volunteer\nSo because I was a retired and knew what to do I could do it but you cannot expect volunteers to be the the to get this work done not the way it really needs to be done so I when the bishops said um\nHe thought we had outgrown ourselves I said you're right and so then I wrote to the presiding bishop bishop curry and sad\nWe want to start a center would you be interested in supporting that and he said he was and so we are now not just for Atlanta but the center for the whole church which is all of the United states and eleven countries [noise]\nAnd so if I had any sense I Would not have taken the job because that's a huge amount of of a responsibility but I feel like that you just take a step at a time and you just go forward so the work is we've already work now\nAll the way to Honduras which is a province nine in our church the Latin America in Providence\nAnd I was just in Honduras a month ago working with folks there and then across the country of working with people in Iowa and Tennessee in Texas I just all over\nAnd so it and it's just you know it's one phone call one workshop one speech one conversation at a time and it doesn't matter whether it's hero in Honduras but I looked at our scope and in one year\nWe can we mapped out ourselves and we are working here in the diocese we're working in the southeast which is our province for they were working nationally because we're in all these other dioceses across the country and internationally in Honduras and also in Guyana we are\nOur diocese is uh is has a sister relationship with K.C Cole scanner so we will be doing some\nWe've had people go and they are already on pilgrimages but we'll be doing some work with Canadians as well so I'm pretty excited about that and you know to be to be this retired African American studies professor who did this work for\nAll these years into now have this chance to be here and bring those skills and that passion and and sets of intention allergic to this work\nUnder this umbrella is a real gift\nYou do a lot of work with faith leaders mhm I'm curious what questions are one of those familiar questions that you get from them\nHandling maneuvering navigating through the racism space when it intersects with I once religion or one's faith and you're a leader mhm what do they want well\nOne thing people say to be more than I Wish I Would hear is how hard it is to have a conversation about race and I just want to say yeah but you know\nYou just have to start and so we actually host conversations on race where we've set up panels and and help people see how you can do that because it's a matter of having the courage to do it first of all\nSo um the other thing that comes up a lot as we don't know what to do\nYou know here we are and we know that the church is not where it needs to be and we know racism is running rampant all over the place and we just don't know what to do\nAnd I I Try to help people refrain refrain that question it's not that you don't know what to do is that you don't have the courage to do what you do know you need to do because it's not it doesn't take long to figure out that racism is wrong\nAnd and that the church if anywhere there's inequity we need to be speaking to it now you have to decide if you have the courage to do it and be willing to suffer whatever the consequences are so if you were a priest and you end up on Sunday Morning and preach about\nThe inequities and the the wrongness of racism they're going to be people in the few who don't like it and they're going to be people who start paying their pledges then who go to some other church where they don't have to hear that kind of a sermon so that's those are the for me that's really the bigger bigger issue and so\nI hear behind many of those kinds of questions are laments I hear an issue about courage about you know I'm I'm\nI Do this really you're asking do I have the courage to go on this journey the way I Need to because now you're beginning to see is a journey to go on and what do I have the courage to do it so one of the things we've done here\nIs invited people from around the country to come to Atlanta and let's have a conversation about what are you doing what do you wish you were doing how things\nGoing what kind of community of support do you have because it's hard to stand up and take back the kind of risk that needs to be taken if you don't feel like there is anybody going on a journey with you and so some of these some of our people are out in\nYou know a little church way out somewhere in South Georgia and the the priest is going to stand up on Sunday Sunday morning and talk about racism and everybody in the room is white and nobody wants to hear it it takes some it takes a little more than just thinking that's a good thing to do I mean you need a community of support\nAnd you need to have come to terms with\nWhat it is what it is you feel how to do and how do you want to live that call out and so I think that um [noise]\nI I'm we're offering a service to help people feel emboldened to to tell the truth\nAnd that's what that's what I hear a lot from like all over the country in the back of the question of I don't know what to do or what do we do how do we start a conversation is how do I do this work can survive\nYou know how do I do this work and get to stay a priest or a deacon or keep my job and you know because I Know I Know church people they they don't like what they don't like something they ... the first thing they do is could given their money\nAnd then if you get enough of them doing that it affects everything and then they go somewhere else because they can you know we there are a lot of folks who think these\nIf you go somewhere else you can find a different message I don't know what Jesus they have in mind 'cause the last time I checked there was the same went everywhere but they seem to think there's you know across town you could get a different version of Jesus and maybe you can but I just feel like that that is a fear\nOr underneath the the most of the questions that come\nGiven the current political space where in one might want to counter that political space has been spring a lot of tension discourse in our nation\nI see the role of faith leaders and we're going to know the intersection politics mhm\nYou know if you think about you have you have to think about who what what is it that you're saying you believe in and Jesus was really\nOut there on the cutting edge speaking about wrong and calling\nPower into question and I think that's part of the job of fake they failed person or person trying to be on a fake Germany period I don't care what your faith is that you have a responsibility to not just acquiesce to the culture\nAnd right now we have a whole lot of people who just walking on the fleet so they're willing to agree to whatever is is bad so and let me just say quickly that if folks want to come on November second\nThe event starts at nine thirty here at the center and they need to go to the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta's website to register and registration is limited so powerful day indeed\nYes Dr Katherine ... thank you so much for taking the time thank you for inviting closer look to the center thank you for coming thank you [noise]\n\n\n\nDo you want
