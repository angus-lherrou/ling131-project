women and that's how they do the ranking\n... thinks in terms of when we have these rankings in these rates and you want people to understand that there's a reason you have these statistics and do you want to talk about that in your sessions when you're working with people\n[noise] we do because uh it is important to hold up the mirror to society is that this is a serious problem\nAh because no surprises in the segment of our communities is do want to believe that it's not that bad so the value of these statistics these kind of um um evaluation and research is to say we've got a serious problem here and we need to be doing something about it should we do to reduce talk about that you know work\nWhich have we seen these numbers decrease over the years you point to the fact that from the campaigns to what you all do with your individual organizations are we seeing the number the incidents decrease at all I see that\nThere was a very very recently um the latest report on the

Seventeen right over the past twelve months Ninety six individuals that is correct you left your audience about men stopping violence\nWe are social change organization with a mission to engage men\nTo work to advise against women through innovative training programs in an advocacy\nMeant stopping violence believe that it's important again to create spaces for individual men who want to do the work we also believe it's important to engage the community at the end of the day we do not see mailbox gift we met is a problem of individual men the culture is very invested in wanting to say let's\nIdentify these few bad guys and go ahead and fix them and we're holding up the middle to the community said\nNo you can always have the few guys six but if the policies and procedures and the practices that are based insects is thirty six suspect drug all values it's a structural issue and I can't just fix the cat just fix those individual and I think going back to you you're you're sharing about the ...\n... it's a really good example where that institution in my view should women is much more important than women's lives and that held up a really powerful mirror and you had a book I found\nReally on board with with the schools and saying a lot of horrible things about and I'm blanking on um the survivors name right now but they're basically got permission from the school\nTo behave in horrible way to say that yes let's start with coach Myers and\nWe were so short order and although it was horrible and people were releasing the address where the the and we don't we don't know the whole story\nBut you ... that led to behaviors they're supposed to talk about behavior because someone said look you know what is it just simply for this behavior they need counseling is it they should be locked up you know is there any proven\nWhen you talk about how to use he talked about how do you fix someone you just can't fix him overnight and you probably just can't fix them through you know\nTherapy groups I don't know how we begin when you talk about someone who is is the abuser how to use\nSo we're very major part of being an abuser is I'm not taking responsibility for it is saying it's not me it's the victim's fault she made me do it she wouldn't be quiet ... fix dinner right she couldn't take care of the children but it's all out there and the user sees themselves as the victim so I think intervention has to be\nWhere that abuser begins to recognize and hold himself or herself one in four women one in seven men will be victims of domestic violence so it it does occur both ways eighty five percent of victims are women\nBut where the abuser hold themselves accountable and begins to acknowledge I Am responsible for this behavior criminal intervention can help the abuse or understand they're accountable if I'm arrested and go to jail\nThe person the system is saying hey this isn't me I have to change the right kind of therapy the right kind of intervention where it's not oh you poor person what happened that you resolve this of violence but\nViolence is wrong you have to acknowledge that and you have to agree that you're going to stop it can be very important and let's talk about resources\nBecause often the abuser may be the person who holds the the the household the finances they may be the only one bringing in a steady paycheck what resources are available whether it's men or women here in Georgia when that's the situation to others\nSo partnership against domestic violence we have a twenty four hour hotline for oh four eight seven three one seven six six twenty four hours a day three hundred sixty five days a year there's a person on the other end and the first thing that you're going to hear is hello are you safe because then all of our services we want to be sure that we're working for the safety of the person\nWe have to emergency shelter as we have supportive housing in the community we can help people with legal advocacy obtained temporary protective orders\nThere's forty nine shelters in Georgia so if you're not in the metro Atlanta area go online and do a search say you know Sylvana Georgia domestic violence shelters and you can find resources that are closely located at the other challenges as it relates to some immigrant communities\nThere are challenges they're absolutely challenges and frankly I'm In the current political climate it's even more difficult for refugee in immigrant communities\nUm abusers will use what they see as the person's weak point against them so batters will say\nYou're not here legally call the police they're going to lock you up they're going to put you in jail they are going to take your children from you and they're going to deport you there is relief for women who are not here documented at their victims of domestic violence said that's not necessarily going to be the case that that fear means that we are seeing a\nSharp decrease in refugee and immigrant women that are sticking assistance than recently that there was legislation that was passed\nThat would allow for a someone who was a victim of domestic violence to break the lease and not have to do with the the process of being a victim so that\nHeld very important legislation because if you even if you have a temporary protective order against your abuse or if he knows where you live he can come\nAnd stock that site and be there waiting for you and you got to go inside and outside at times so that ability to break that least without financial penalty and get to a safe living place that the abuser is not aware of can be critical\nI Wonder if they are really important point you know people always say well why don't women leave why would you stay in put up with that\nAnd there's lots of pieces to that and important piece is that when my ... are in greater danger of being killed where and when they are in the process of leaving our after they've left the abuser so to think oh just leaving everything will be fine that's absolutely not the case\nYou Lester how was the youngest age you all are working with with the organization and is it is it enough Jeannie didn't start even younger\nWell as\nMiddle school middle school I just said that we go into the community wherever we're invited to talk about this issue so we get invited to middle school high school college and we think that's really important to get to that community as as as quickly as possible\nI was gonna say also about the issue of resources for men out there who believe they have a problem and wanted to do something about it we have a twenty four week program that they can enroll in a and that can really make a difference so they might suggest they do they call the office at four four\nTo seven zero nine eight nine four or go to W. W. dot ... dot org also we believe that this or not to be again about men who have I been who have\nBeen identified as having been abusive to women but men into community who are concerned about the issue so we happen to a community forum I Believe in November thirteenth and being decided by head right now\nAnd this is open to everyone in the topic is a man's response to the me too movement because we believe again as part of our responsibility as an organization is doing gauge the community to educate the community about the issue of violence against women so I just wanted to put that out there as into the opportunity for the community to get involved with this issue\nAnd there's so many issues that we didn't talk about that we need to ... think about same sex relationships as well there there's just so much that we didn't get to but before we wrap up I just want each of you to reflect again on the importance of people reaching out whether they are ... ... we're going to say whatever they are in the relationship the importance of people reaching out\nAbsolutely collar hotline for us for eight seven three one seven six sects you don't have to be seeking shelter you don't have to be ready to leave this call and say hey I'm really confused things don't feel right I Need to talk to someone we can talk to you we can give you resources we have kept saying in the community as well\nYou listed in addition to what I just want to encourage institution churches mosques synagogues except for schools to reach out to us uh two two part to collaborate with them in ways in which we can work together to prevent ... against women\nI'm not the first time the second time which was almost three or four years later ah she asked and it was just as easy for me I was Seventeen Eighteen I said no way I got to close that fight at school I got hit and that was it um we see so much throughout foundation and that's why we teach a lot on\nThe relationships we send therapist in for six weeks teaching ... healthy relationships that people can understand\nThere are a lot of red flags prior to the physical on and so understanding what those red flags look like knowing is just healthier the signs that I'm seeing from aggression too threatening to hurt your animal different things of that nature for people to make decisions than this might not be the best\nSituation for me and you mentioned that you were fourteen and working in the segment earlier you Lester talked about trying to have these conversations in middle school\nYes we start as young as Thirteen working with the ... victims so we work with a a lot of the EU shelters but we were in high schools and colleges if the number one issue on college campuses as I said the nomination elegy TB community is an elderly abuse communities the AIDS community so starting young is very important\nSherman fourteen it's someone listening so that it seems so young to start talking about domestic violence\nNot at all the earlier we talk about it the more um\nChance we have to eradicate it I did not grow up in a household with domestic violence zone kids who were wins but I had children who were seeing their parents are involved in domestic violence and it was a it it was a motivator for me to get out of the situation so that I did not\nContinue to ah to raise my children in that in that pattern\nGerman have to ask if you didn't have to because you said this was four years in ... do you think it would've taken you loan I Do\nThink it would have probably take any longer I think people stay in abusive relationships for a number of reasons and that's the sort of touched on this earlier and said you list or but it's it's not just one thing it's not just um you had\nToo much to drink one night it is a cycle of ongoing um it's financial it's religious it's embarrassing it it's it there's so many different reasons that keep us I think locked into\nUm these these relationships\n... how do you know we asked a question earlier about changing behavior and you know look there's a twenty four week session for men right so we talk about changing behavior and you want to move someone from from being a victim to survivor\n... there's a mindset their to this therapy that has to take place and that kid as we called it early just can't fix that right what do you want to let women know about that process and and what they can expect\nUm women and men because both of them suffer from domestic violence and again it doesn't happen overnight but you have to be willing to do the work on one of the huge component is educating people\nOn how domestic violence affects everybody not just the not just the victim but how that plays out when you look at young boys between the ages of eleven and twenty six tape the sixty percent of them that are in prison or in print is prison for murdering the mothers abuser\nSo help people understand this is a a cycle\nI'm getting therapy not only for the victims but for the people that are watching if that means children um what that process looks like for victims as well as getting the of the abusers help so it doesn't happen overnight um you have to pull back layers wild ... like when we put a\nTherapist and they go through six weeks of training is pulling those layers back saying what is it that has happened to you and your decision making that had made you think that this is okay that you didn't recognize the signs and actually an act a lot of has to do it in low self esteem just a number of reasons but addressing those did you go through therapy\nNow there was not there be available for me at fourteen fifty sixty now\nUm is important now everybody on our teams I\nStaff everybody that deals comes through our foundation to work with survivors they all we all go have to go through the six weeks training to see but survivors uh getting as well as you know to understand how it works with a therapy so now back then there was no therapy there were no resources\nFor me [noise] sure man we talk about this transition from victims of survivor therapy\nAbsolutely I and I still go to therapy I think it's important sometimes you just need to talk through some of your issues the great thing about a number of these organizations um\nI Know P. H. D. V. had support groups while I stayed at the shelter that gave me my first introduction into therapy in a small\nA group setting and then after we left the shelter they had community um support groups as well they gave us a listing of all the places so wherever you wherever you work anywhere in the city you could find to help\nYou know Nancy mentioned there were forty nine shelters I think in Georgia is a question isn't enough you they\nWouldn't deny the the resources on outweigh any I'm Sorry the need outweigh the resources there or not they're not not a lot of ships because we get calls all day long with people can't get insurance right or waiting list\nA shelters um and so then you put the victim back in a situation well I don't have anywhere to go right I might as well stay where I Am at least have a roof over my head right and so I'm no they're not enough resources out\nHere in Georgia and then when you start looking at smaller rural areas like the area I came from Albany there were not does do support systems in place I mean think about the fact if\nYou say that one in four women is a victim of\nDomestic violence at some point in time in her life one in four and that is regardless of the economic status that is regardless of education that's regardless of of race or creed one in four women there are\nSix women sitting in this room right now so you can imagine that there are many people who are experiencing domestic violence\nWho don't say it for whatever reason you tend to see more people of color in the shelters only because the resources are less at times for some of those people but this is a problem that affects all women of all ages and creed color race ... ... it's it's it's widespread\nAnd I have to say so when you talk about one out of four women went out of seven males that's actually a big an accurate because only five percent of cases are reported so when you look at the other Ninety five percent and less dive in each of those numbers as more of\nOne or two women want out of for males\nRight so you may not think you know a victim of domestic violence\nBut you do and then later tonight AS Nancy mission tragically they're going to name called the names of all those victims from twenty Seventeen just as we wrap up on each of you will for you to reflect on for listeners out there who may know someone who may themselves be involved in a relationship that is\nNot a good relationship what he wanted to get help\nYou don't have to suffer in silence I\nAm I suffered a loan for a long time and finally picked up the phone and call to help line and it made all the difference in the world to me you can call and get someone to talk you through your issues and options\nUh maybe leaving today isn't the right solution for you but there are solutions you can get help there are organizations available to help\nThem I Would say you are not alone um because when you go to a domestic violence you isolated you're told by your abuser there's nobody out there is going to help you um find someone safe\nTo talk to or get that let you get the help that you need because there are resources out there and don't think it's a\nA daddy and to to need a means there are organizations like ours ... foundation allergy David foundation BA DV partnership against them as long as there's so many organizations that we are here and willing to help you even a national domestic violence hotlines\nDon't ask you because you all parents to any of these conversations with your kids Oh absolutely\nI have two girls and my girls have been very active since they were young I'm organizing and working throughout the foundation absolutely my children\nHave been to the P.

hope and confidence on the months and years ahead but I Would like to tell you what I often told you when you were much younger\nI like you just the way you are\nOn what's more [noise] I'm so grateful to you for helping the children in your life to know that you'll do everything you can to keep them safe\nAnd to help them express their feelings in ways that will bring hailing in many different

about the situation it's still happening at the the suspect being arrested with the bombs and you think of everything that's happening in our nation\nI think it's safe to say that our nation is still with some tension right now absolutely how do you just talk about that with your own kids 'cause you're a parent correct yes they should you have with them about what's taking place in the world [noise] well I\nTalk about it with him all the time because they see that it affects me they see me upset if I\nWhen I learned about something that has happened that's violent that's I'm cruel that's dangerous in the immediate and long term and um it's very important to me to\nBe aware that when they see me having a reaction they would like to know more I mean I'm the person that they I'm One of the people they depend on most so um\nIf they don't know why I'm Upset if they don't know what it is that's making me anxious than they are going to fill in the blank so I make sure and let them know oh gosh this thing so this thing is going on\nWas there ever an age if you thought maybe they could not understand so you waited and then their ages were their ages my children's age is now are nine and Thirteen okay so what's a good age for you that you thought it was appropriate to have those conversations with them I don't I ... it it always was there yeah\nIt I never um flick to switch and then decided okay now I'm gonna start telling them the truth I just let it be there and\nUm you know sometimes I probably shared more information than they won it I I have definitely noticed but they let me know you know a child to let you know they'll just change the subject or they'll leave the room but I make sure they understand that um [noise]\nWe can talk about anything and then I Want them

in your house in your household and your kids [noise] Irish yeah and I from it well it was it\nDiscussed enough that I was aware that there was a thing called racism and I was aware that it affected people's lives in very damaging and destructive ways and I was aware that um my parents cared about it\nI also you know my parents taught me and him body love and respect for everyone\nAnd yet I got the message from the culture anyway that\nRace and racism we're we're a a problem that black and brown people were having it was a ... like a problem that's happening over there and I could be sad about it and I could even be angry about it but not too angry and um\nBut somehow like I was separate from it\nAnd I got that lesson in the history classes as well and all throughout school and I also got the message that when I did get when I was attuned to something and very upset about it like being talked down by white family members this is too big for you this is\nThis was here long before

about sex and mixed messages about sex and race um ... those are the first four books of the series but my\nWhat I wanted to do is create children's books that don't solve those problems for children but really just show children kind of moving through a crisis with consciousness\nWhen did the notion to write not my idea of a book about white message is your plan to write a book about race\nNo I plan to address race within the series within those ... characters and lives and within the stories um but I\nI realize somewhere between doing the death book in the sex book that race was next and that specifically it was going to be white miss routing the problem of racism in white and how do you define whiteness at a stage I defined white miss as the um\nThe lies that the dominant culture tells us about white superiority about white goodness about white innocence about\nWhat about a meritocracy which isn't all of this is life and um we're so steeped in it were so immersed in it that it has become invisible\nOr has always been an invisible enough that unless you're really looking for it and you're really going\nGoing into it and you know digging into what is causing these problems um
