which is the weather hurricane Michael has been upgraded to a category ... storm with potential wins of\nGet this one hundred and forty five miles per hour now that's according to the national Hurricane Center which also noted\nThat it would be the first category for storm to hit the Florida Panhandle since records were first kept in Eighteen fifty one now as hurricane Michael makes landfall in Florida Georgia officials are paying close attention to the potential impact right here in our state but as for the Atlantic council theme is a meteorologist with the national weather service\nExpecting most of the impacts that come somewhere between about six PM to six AM Thursday morning\nRight now we are expecting some windows to get up to about thirty to thirty five miles per hour your expecting about one to three inches of rainfall for the region as well\nAnd there is a very very slight tornado risk although it is mostly towards the south and east of Atlanta region but it's possible we couldn't get a one or two tornados up around that area now\nYesterday Georgia governor Nathan Deal did declare a state of emergency for Ninety two counties throughout south Georgia but that has changed within the last hour and while visiting the state operations center at the George emergency management agency or Jima governor deal made this announcement\nBut they did it entered does this\nEnergized your particular demographic if there were talking about in terms of millennials\nI Would say most definitely um you know seeing are seeing our values\nAre being a protected seeing what we care for being protected seeing the rule of law actually are being applied fairly uh you know in this country we believe that you know and this is a proven guilty\nUm there there were no facts ... collaborating and this is for a ... um there were there was never in a moment um during\nThese seven FBI investigation that he went through um that suggested that there were any wrongdoing on his part so the ... the rule of law the innocent until proven guilty um and just\nFinally Republicans giving a bat bone um is really something that\nMy generation as excited about\nJake what do you think [noise] yeah um I I think there's no doubt that right now are we we do have a very polarized electorate a from a political standpoint I mean I just I don't think anyone can deny that a ... a bit of reassurance in my opinion in this kind of\nGoes from the initial video we had already had older people are speaking as millennials are the most diverse generation American history\nI and I say this very frequently were were a generation that\nHas been exposed to people that look different than us from people that are different backgrounds and we are and and I agree with Porsche were were more tolerant or two people that are that are different and I think hopefully long term\nThat makes the discourse be different than it currently is and to me that's not a political issue\nI I don't think that it's a political issue to say that we shouldn't find middle middle ground we shouldn't have\nDiscussions like this ... with people who don't agree with us on every political issue but at the end of the day I think that's going to break down differences because this is most important to note all humans have far more similarities and differences and if they come to the table and talked about issues\nI think that they will reach the best conclusion long term you think about the current temperature political temperature of the nation\nOr not to return to a couple of things that were present already I think I'm back to purchase one I think was very um specifically with a ... to the cabinet nominations but also to um a lot of the trends in politics right now both the national um and then gone on to the state and local levels which are that\nThe cabinet nominations brought up a particular issue Brett Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by by three different women um as long as I said this he was nominated by President Trump who has been accused of sexual assault by I think sixteen Eighteen when something like that um ...\nThings didn't happen in isolation this was not a new\nIssue for us so since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke hum with last year and there have been many many I'm willing to move right the me too movement in arms up and all that right um so these things are happening in a ... a portion that we're becoming less tolerant of things like this will be means as we built\nA certain amount of political momentum a certain amount of political force and awareness around these issues um which as many people have noted um have for very long time gone unaddressed I'm In politics and I think that's another\nWay in which millennial voters are\nIncreasing in their engagement they're seeing things that we're we're the status quo I think we're a lot of millennials that these are things that can't be changed this was just the way the world is and now we have these moments not just me too but black lives matter but a lot of other a vote of other groups that are now finding their voice and finding their power\nUm who are who are making real change and I think that's that's the thing that's the\nThing that's going to spare millennials into\nGreater political engagement is seeing their voices be heard and seeing their ability to make change\nLet me say from an air because among your groups ... what what conversations are you all having you you're out you did encouraging people to register to vote if they haven't and asked him about what issues are important to them what do they tell you what are you hearing\n[noise] well I think there is a I think it cuts into kind of two camps which also I'm as wherever the substance and procedure on the substance side we've got a lot of the the bread and butter issues I think there's a lot of\nOf for lack of a better political imagination\nThat has come into our generation so things like expanding health care access okay which for for a long time a lot of the old guard for lack of a better term is telling us see that's unrealistic that can't happen\nYou know it would be impossible for every single person in the country to have health care and I think we're kind of fed up and are saying no you know what we can okay um so that's one big issue but there's there's you know plenty and brought more but you hear and health care health care is definitely a big one especially because we have that policy fight earlier and then on the what I call the procedural side we have\nUm the current administration has fostered a culture of corruption I think his entire ... a significant portion of his cabinet as\nIs resigned in disgrace over you know from low level the high level graft and corruption and problems like that um and it goes all the way up in New York Times just\nAllege that President Trump had had committed in his career hundreds of literally hundreds of millions of dollars worth of my ex from his father right with money from his father and then through outright fraud and so I think people are concerned about that very deeply as well\nWhat issues what are you talking about the economy\nI mean it it is a young person\nOr when you're graduating from college or you want a job and unfortunately and environment you have now it's very difficult to food the student loan debt situation is very difficult to timely pay off the debt and so ah ... the reality is for young people\nThey want the ability to ensure that their education their hard work their training comes in materialize as an opportunity to get a job and I think if you look at the numbers there's no doubt about the fact that the economy is in his status I'm really of a Supreme growth unemployment\nRate is is is that all time low stock markets at all time highs and that's due to fiscal conservatism principles less government\nLess regulation um creating an economic system which rewards hard work creativity or all of which\nAre the this country was founded upon and all of which separate the United states of America from every other country in the world um and so maintaining that velocity because at the end of the day\nIn and one thing about politics is\nThat analysts can break it down you know six ways to Sunday but at the end of the day most voters look at\n... am I better off today than I was yesterday with people that have three kids that are making a household income uh fifty thousand or under they are concerned about the bottom line so when they get to the ballot box despite you know all of the rhetoric that in my opinion\nIf you look at the voting trends is what's going to control and I think millennials are no different Ron already think what are you where you are talking about what his house\nI Would have to agree with his work on um on many topics or the economy is definitely one of them you know and and no one's\nConcerned about justice Kavanaugh for Trump if they don't have a job or they're worried about paying bills bills um and then for millennials in particular when I graduated college the first thing I thought about what the job of uh before I graduate college the first thing I thought I was a job um and so I go to college to get a better job\nUm and so I don't want free education\nI Want better economic opportunity or that I can apply might agree to 'em and then when I get that job I Want to make sure that I'm not paying higher taxes so it was on our taxes from the economy we're talking about building wealth\nWe're talking about establishing a community that fosters a healthy lifestyle um and just really the issues that mattered everyday people that do they do not watch Fox News or CNN [noise]\nPushing for the for the issues you're only talking about um a lot of\nThe same um but uh my friends are not consistently talk about a lot of the social issues and concerns that we have as well um my friends run the gamut I'm from literally every social socio economic background you can think of um and we are very concerned about each other\nAnd for our families and for our friends and for our nieces and nephews because none of us have kitchen because we're all through broke [laughter]\nAnd about what kind of world we're leaving for um the people who are looking up to us um and how these elections are impacting Avon example those social issues we were talking about sure um so I have\nFriends that I Know as you can take your community and they're concerned about how they're treated when they step out on the street every day and how maybe they're um nieces and nephews or future children will be treated if they're eligible to Q. when they're in schools um we're concerned about whether or not\nUm our I'm younger counterparts are going to be looking at um\nEven higher student debt than we have if they're going to be able to get a great enough education I'm even be able to get into these institutions of higher learning um what are they learning while they're in school it's it's very much an ongoing conversation about what our young people people are younger than us than these millennials will be I'm left with when we are going\nWell let's talk about the engagement process in terms of your group being engaged in the larger picture I mean you all are from the Atlanta young Republicans and the young Democrats of Atlanta is your voice being hurt within the group respectively the political parties as a whole and if not\nHow do you bridge that gap within your own party for\nSure um I think that we are a generational we're not\nI'm telling you I was going to make was alright thank you [noise]\nBiggest issue I guess for me is gun laws of into three year olds\nThat will be entering school at some point\nJust the fear of\nOf guns and what's happened in our past so that's that would be the most important issue to me [noise]\nMostly for me and protecting Planned Parenthood and women's rights\nConservative spending it was going to have Washington ... spend less money at a federal level but probably spend a little bit more money locally someone who\nI feel is more\nIn tune with those of us that are in the middle versus extreme right or left\nSo that concerns me a lot they were getting so did this in this country and I think there's a lot of us that feel so concerned that one was in one direction or the other and shouldn't be that way 'cause I think the majority of us are silent\nThrough therapy sensation of working class not important to me I'm looking for the most part I mean we live in the southwest of lens neighborhood a moose seat of neighborhood is changing and we're not going to use the word but however it's happening\nIt's one of the main issues is like urban development and transportation but also like not leaving people behind in that process as seems to happen in general the the develops like the poor people get left behind so mainly Atlanta based issues because that's just where I live\nBut also the rest of the state needs to be taken care of his\nThat's his on immigration and how they view it in the states especially with things like the immigration detention centers like the ones that are in Georgia in Lincoln county I Know there's a big one there it's kind of how to handle that\nAnd it definitely has had environment\nAnd I think that makes impact about what kind of citizen scenic route restrictions on emissions and I say Georgia and that's what I've been thinking about\nPlanet that or here's a look

Atlantis choice for NPR is always I'm Rose Scott developing the Gulch it say five billion dollar project what they want point seven five billion coming from public financing\nThe California based developer the CIA um group is looking to build mix used retail and commercial dwellings and depending on who you ask the answers rule very regarding does the public cost outweigh the public benefits\nThat we've been talking about but now\nThe importance of money from tax allocation districts or tax so in a nutshell a tad allows the percentage of property taxes over specific amount of time to go towards projects for specific area it's pretty pretty simple his little history lesson there are tend to add to the city of Atlanta and counties also in the mix\nA PS participates in five of those tests we'll get to that moment which means that ... a district agrees to forego some of its money from property taxes to fund set project everybody followed me okay now\nEnter a P. S. and the ghost development deal which will require funding for maybe as his property taxes because adults will be develop inside the Westside Ted join me in Studio down off of the school districts concerns is APO superintendent Dr ... thank you for coming and taking the time\nThank you so much rice or give us an opportunity to educate our community about the cat and the effect on the school district\nLet's start from the beginning and work for it because he's a correct today PS is currently participating in the five times I mentioned that is true okay now I Know due to market activity the amount of money kicked in on an annual basis the changes right\nIt does it does but um since Nineteen Ninety nine when the ... started we put in about four hundred and thirty four million dollars and the five cats in which we participate they say the number again four hundred and thirty four million dollars since Nineteen Ninety nine since Nineteen Ninety nine of course none of the task of closed so we still have more to\nPay well we'll get to that at the moment because I think what's important for our listeners to know that does the district actually get to recoup any of the money paid until the tax\nUh it's very little uh the the concept is that the tides actually have to finish being developed and then once they're closed\nThe concept is that then I'm you're able to actually generate taxes that would allow for you to start making it back but as you can imagine you would it would take a couple of like a decade or so to be able to finally make yourself whole again and then really start benefiting\nI've heard the counter argument or opposition to that well you're not really missing any money technically I've heard people say that your what's your response\nUm that isn't true of course uh the state uh doesn't see it that way we lose about sixteen million dollars and our local fair share\nAnd that's an immediate loss once the developments actually start happening on one of these tad geographic sites so the way the state sees a our school district and the tag is that you chose to be in them but they withhold five Neal's\nUm of what we could earn because\nThey you know believe that you made a different decision in your community but you are just going to have to ... they're going to withhold the money that would otherwise be coming to the system\nNow let's be fair because obviously the the a PS agreeing to participate and attach happened before you\nLong before you came on board correct so one would my aunt asked this question okay well is there somewhere in the contract for the district can ask that either we pay off the ... pay it off or are you close it if you feel like development has reached its peak for that said area for example let's look at Atlantic Station exactly\nExactly so um Atlantic Station is a perfect example it was an industrial waste land by most people's standards\nUm and so if it weren't they ... they call it a but for test\nA it would not be developed but for the designation of a tad and actually for what it's worth we support cleaning up blighted underdeveloped\nI'm depressed areas of our city\nThe challenges that what you're supposed to be doing with all the new revenue coming in to that tattoo is paying off the debt or the bonds inside the tag that hasn't been happening and because of that\nThings then start triggering like you'll extend the tab longer which means you're in it longer which means it will be a longer time period before you start seeing the benefit of what the spirit of attach should have been doing from the beginning\nAnd let's be fair to because we can also point to something that's happened now and just here but across the nation to ten years ago which was the great recession when what nobody building anything right so right at vets and unforeseen unforeseen circumstances\nEveryone knows and economy isn't strong forever so you can always in ... and certain times\nPeriod you're going to see some type of recession\nNow let's get to the school to do because there's a lot here to unpack when did the district first learn of this deal involving a C I Am group to develop the Gulch in wanting a PS two from what I understand to extend the west side was that part of the initial\nI Want to be clear like when when we were looking at all things a PS everything that we had inherited back in December\nOf a twenty Seventeen when people were running for office where there was a school board member city council member a mayoral candidate we brought our charge into for children it included talking about pads and wanting to go back and renegotiate some of these these contracts that weren't working in our favor\nTo be taking care of and we just feel about our just start putting these together you know in a way I guess you might feel lucky\nOh yeah yeah we have a house I'm just over neighbors don't\nYou know well look I Hope you know the rest of the country is he's watching a

E. dot org now coming up just a few moments we continue our conversations on developing the Gulch [noise]\nThey wanted some clarity because of the forty acres you say most of that is public property or private only ... as I understand\nIt there is a ... eleven or twelve parcels I'm not\nTotally clear I think Norfolk Southern owns a the biggest piece a but there's land in there that's owned by the state there's some private property owners smaller pieces it's a it's it's some of the oldest property that owned in in the city I mean that's where the railroads began\nAnd so it's it's confusing is to actually trying to figure out who owns what\nRight so then what you're selling well get exactly if you're the CIA group looking to build on public property but then you want\nThe public to fund it therein lies the rub and I well I don't I don't think the city I think\nThe city has a couple of pieces that part of the deal they're swapping for other property that the city is going to get the the state owns the land under the one of the parking deck I don't think none of these properties are usable in the sense that if you've acquired one you could do something with it because\nIt's all either land locked down there in the Gulf with railroads running through it martyr running underneath it the the Gulch is an area that is very complicated from a property ownership standpoint\nI used a lot of public broadcasting Atlanta's paper last night to print out the six hundred pages [laughter] just that you read it off a full disclosure no I but I read some of the most important ally in their age and you have been a part of this community for a long time\nWhy do you feel that this development from the CIA in group is a better deal for the stadium where\nThere are a lot of numbers and we can get ... specific but you're overview\nMy view is that this is a a well first of all my view is that we have this gaping hole in our community and it it is both psychological and physical or we we have\nLived with this whole because none of us are none of the public entities that whether it be the city to carry the state have the wherewithal or the resources to figure out what to do\nIt because it's forty it's a it's a lot it's a ... in a lot of different stakeholders exactly\nAnd it's a lot and then you have to you it it it's kept real estate's capital intensive so someone has to be courageous enough to step forward [noise]\nSo in my opinion from a thirty five thousand feet this is a historic opportunity where you have a private developer\nWho has the wherewithal and the creativity to produce in the in the courage really to produce something that in the long term interest of the city I think is is a great opportunity\nNow what's your name in and do what you've been like that for a long time\nWell a good question now whereas whereas everybody been a four Seventy years been why these guys now I think ah we're lucky I think they discovered is because of the connection with uh the hawks in the ... the\nThere are others they act like but\nOne brother said to the other had come help us\nAnd they and they are based on my research they are a ... you mentioned you know these are big boys but they've done a lot of development they've got some developments that deal with casinos [noise] if\nYou don't believe that the Gulch could be developed with this much\nFrom another developer because now we're going to get into all the pros and cons of this deal right\nI Know I don't know I mean who knows someone ... they just couldn't happen and maybe somebody comes along and it's extremely complex and you need to be ex ... these ... these this particular developer has the financial\nWherewithal they have a they have public pension funds that are supporting them and they have the ability\nOr to stroke some big checks and take some big risk and not and they should then they develop but then on their own to they really need the ... well this is this is the situation there is no develop all land without building a platform shore okay I'll um Atlantic Station you couldn't have\nTorn down to Atlantic Station the old a steel mill and just started building you had to cap all that environmental hazard in this case it's similar\nYou you have to raise this up to the viaduct level that it is today because you cannot amalgam made all that land and then come up with it it's impossible it's so many so many constrain Shia railroads running through to you have more to running through it you have a right of ways conceded to various entities so\nYou have to build this platform where the platform becomes their land\nSo there's two most expensive parts of this or to pay for their land okay we said about ... ... ah parcels which is approximately two hundred million dollars\nThen it costs somewhere not shirt to build up the platform build some streets and so forth somewhere four or five hundred million dollars I don't think they're in their numbers that they're not\nUm you know who knows exactly the precise and so that so they have to spend about six or seven hundred million dollars now that kinda money doesn't grow on trees with any developer and so you have there's a there's a few people in this country that could do something\nLike that I don't think anyone would argue that incentives in tax breaks are key in luring that has I haven't heard anyone say that that shouldn't happen but you know ha it's at the core of this also as we go back to that at one point seven billion and you look at\nWhat needs to happen particularly let's just focus on a ... for a minute and riding schools and you and I both know that the school system that educate said roughly maybe eighty percent of the students are on free or reduced lunch which is an economic indicator for those are living at or below the poverty level\nAnd I was listening what Dr ... as in terms of as it relates to the task and the problems that this would be a additional financial burden on the district\nWe have our own priorities kids come first the staff we support them or second\nThird in line are our tax payers so I've got fifty thousand kids six thousand employees in a hundred and fifty a dish thousand tax payers and what we're able to do when you open your tax bill and you see how much it costs you'll see that a PS is the largest portion of your bill\nThe only way I can help a homeowner\nIn addition to helping kids is to be able to address that millage rate so I can reduce their tax bill so yes it's about kids yes it's about the staff but it's also about the taxpayer\nWho is expecting us to be responsible to ask tough questions to make sure we're not putting an undue burden on them because make no mistake if the money isn't being paid for right now in the tag someone else is paying for it and they live outside the tad\nHere we go attach thrived talked about this and there are ten times as well I've been to the land a PS is participates in five\nAge it could still get done with out having to one either extend that west side tad or can you understand the superintendents part because it's another additional right financial burden on this district and\nYeah let me just first address the or the cat issues and in general ... in in because I think that's that's something that has been around the community for a while [noise]\nTax allocation districts or to financing our best practice and economic development across the country that's true and they are particularly framed around trying to solve difficult infrastructure problems without a public entity stroking a check up front in order to fix it\nSo in in this case is no different the taxes that\nUm aren't there there's no sales tax there today there is very very limited property tax so we're Maria and I may differ is she's talking about she's losing money but that money doesn't exist today it has to be created by the developer\nAnd they have to borrow that what they create\nFor twenty twenty five years or Thirty years and then it revert back now you know all about yeah I asked her that too and so when I think her um comment Israeli referring to historical problem that she's looking at from the five pads which\nThat money didn't exist when it started now exist and it produced those results I agree with her I have no problem with looking at uh all the ads and the policies and in fact even on this deal I think there's a deal in here for\nA PS that'll solve some of their that the problems of of loaning money to the developer so to speak\nMuch like the outline deal was in ... where is it well they haven't got the problem in this situation is there's nothing to talk about in the city council votes for this deal in ... I mean it really I mean there is that you're\nYou're absolutely right but if there are tens had said to save it they're already out there ... and ... and I'm not a mouthpiece for a pie I says 'cause I'm going to get to some community issues as well\nBut AJ there is a concern that if you expect in the west side tad right when the east side tad was promised to the district to be close and now it's not going to be\nThat is an extra financial burden on the district now let's talk about the community benefits 'cause okay everybody's got to stay care you and I both know that certain neighborhoods in the city of Atlanta had been promised all this\nStuff before in the past and it didn't happen\nYou being a person that concerned about public policy wise in their community benefits\nYou his way of not only bringing out the best in your ... but then proposing we come to get you can't we come together\nAnd you do it off ... and so persuasive and having his bat behind my chair means that you know it lost its interests\nCandace Wheeler my same producers like my little sister brought on and my colleague we always talk about what is closer look it's about conversations for the community\nThat's it it's not my show for my show we'd be talking about hip hop class in jazz Motown over time these cats horses you know and my favorite authors what about dogs and dogs because I Love rex get your body love it to direct\nBut you know it is a it's a program about the community and it's about bringing to the table those different viewpoints\nDo that a valid now if you just want to come over here and yell and scream because you know we don't have snow I Can't do anything about that\nHowever it's about the community and what is public broadcasting in Atlanta orders WABC what a city lights\nWhat our newsroom team there about going out into the community telling those stories reporting on those stories and rewarding the U.S\nWe can do it and that's what we do with financial so it's warm years so called six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety or online at W.
