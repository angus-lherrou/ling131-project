lot of people have argued that it you know if again the analogy to Nineteen Ninety two that it backfired that Thomas was confirmed but that it backfired on\nA Republican because there was now this up swelling if more women running more Democrats running and they took back a lot of the seats there and I think there is a concern\nOn the for the Republicans on that sense of who exactly is it going to motivate and what type of action is that going to have\nOn the other thing though I think is that it's not just that but it's also with a little bit interesting here is that we are in fact so close to the elections so the candidates are already set\nThat is the one difference with the Thomas hearings is that it happened about a year before the actual midterm election and was in Ninety One and so you had the ability that prompted people to run whereas this time\nWe already have our candidates in office and now it's the question of how well do they reflect even some of the sentiments that are being expressed well\nLet's look across the aisle here because if you want to put a lot of steak in polls and some people to some dumb but there was a a national poll I think early last month which indicated Democrats would they fourteen point lead over Republicans [laughter] you know for the U.S house now\nIf you want to look at that poll but it only sampled about a little over a thousand voters that show that America's preferred democratic candidates for Congress over GOP can it do you put much they can polls\nAnd if the Democrats are you pay attention to this or you do not because also it can lead to what we called voter apathy well as the Democrats are going to see that I'm I'll stay home or hey we're going to take it so now let's get more Republicans out there that could depend on how you look at it and go either way so\nHistorically the polls that look at the ship like these broad national polls that look at sort of who people which party they seem to prefer within Congress do have some predictive ability [laughter] is it to the degree that it suggests that part is unclear and I think what's also again\nThat we have to kind of remember is that that say\nWho would you rather see in Congress do you want to be a Democratic Congress Republican Congress but what people actually vote for our individual candidates and a lot of times people may want to see the broader Congress look one way but when they're in the voting booth and they faced with to the exact candidates are into\nTheir possible income than is\nThen they might go to a different way right a lot of people like their income than they like their representative even if they don't necessarily like what Congress has a whole is doing\nFor the day was pose I mean part of it is what type of democracy or do we want to report to represent because on one side many of the the just the bear out the fact that people that voted against\nTrump's own policies and part about democracy has to function in the positive\nThe negative so we don't make assertions about what we want as much as what we don't want it to be that becomes problematical for time because we're going to have to decide it's not that you're running against someone else's position what are you advocating for such that it resonates with me but I Would advocate for\nInteresting because the pope projections may not be lost on President Trump would you just mentioned but this past weekend the president did continually supportive judge Kavanaugh\nConfirmed judge Kavanaugh's confirmed one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time made yours was early where I go to public service you know\nFor ten years these young guy but for ten years they've been talking about him longer than that I didn't know what I've heard about um a lot because they were all saying he should be on the United States Supreme court that's why I put 'em up\nAnd and I will tell you\nTell you he has suffered them the meanness the anger\nAnd two things here that says the president's still continue to support Brett Kavanaugh but also it's West Virginia\nSo you look at that in terms of which states that President Trump he will stop and he will he knows his base he knows which state that will rally behind him but the geo peace it is it is it dangerous though given that\nWon the FBI investigation is not over and we don't know which way this is going to come out with the Democratic party is still invested\nIn Wisconsin\nPennsylvania may be the states that have\nQuit in you know done well\nGo ahead well well yeah [laughter] it wouldn't have been a problem would have been elected and so I think those are the territories maybe their little purple now so he can have West Virginia as far as the the poster that concerned if those three states that are still major and so the issue again for me is whether or not\nThe candidates are going to run on the positive side that is these are the policies that are have contagious to your demographic versus against Trump because what if you win this time Trump's out of office in four years now what are you advocating for what you pushing for\nAnd now you lose the consistency of you know protracted elections for professor\nStarted picking back onto a professor David just said if you're a GOP candidate and one of those key states do you really want to align yourself with the president right now and also Brett Kavanaugh or do you just remain kind of silent wait till all this plays out\nBecause as you just mentioned voters depending on what moved there in when they get to the polls they may forget about all that or they may be fresh in their mind particularly if\nA candidate has been backing\nBrett Kavanaugh and then something else comes out and prove that ... maybe that was something that happened\nIs it's a gamble if you're a GOP candidate in one of those states\nIt definitely is and I think that for all of the senators and house candidates they're walking a very fine line of trying to figure out exactly what is the best way to put this Ford pray obviously if you are a member of the Republican Party you want to support the leader of your party who is the president of the United states at the same time\nThere are very ... there are concerns about what is going to happen here and what you also don't want to be accused of is a type of tribalism you're only supporting the candidate\nBecause a Republican nominated him and not because in fact he has a ... a strong record or that there are not concerns about various issues um because of course it's not simply about right the allegations that have come out but also questions about impartiality about whether or not there were um\nPerhaps misleading testimony in other portions out that that had already come out and so I think that's a very fine line to walk about how strongly you want to go in on that\nBut if you're a GOP candidate and maybe even a Democrat can do you also focus on other issues because you mentioned immigration and also here in Georgia Medicaid expansion is a big is a big issue as well as you know the economy and the good news if your President Trump is that you just got Canada to agree to a revised edition of of NAFTA\nThat could play if you wanna if your candidate usually want to focus on issues and not so much focus on Brett Kavanaugh you have the issues they look our counties great now we have Canada\nMexico on board you know things are great for America\nI think that's a great way to put it I think in fact we do see a lot of the candidates trying to step away from it and instead discuss these other issues and I think in many ways we're seeing it not only in the Republican but also the Democrats right a lot of the Democratic candidates are being very hesitant like it's not that they want to do a rally about cabinet instead they're talking about\nMedicaid expansion they're talking about a C. A. and um whether or not there's going to be a protections for pre existing conditions there talking about a violence against women act and the fact that it expired last night and they're talking about re all of these other issues I think\nIn part because who wants to step into that in Iraq because it really is\nAnd could it be just an overload professor Davis for the voter if all of this is we're just focusing on Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh voters get tired of that they want to hear something else\nAnd then we become sort of reduction this and that is social issues\nLike immigration um how pay the taxes who covers taxes will they be decreased increase for you lose the performed that the of the serious issue\nAnd it becomes reduction is that is what would you have voted or had you never heard anybody policies you would have voted on social issues\nWhat are you going to do with immigration even here in Georgia where one of the candidates platforms about gang activity and then you associated implicitly with Latino and people from Mexico and the idea if even if you don't asserted conflicting issues tacitly\nLet's talk about the southern voter here because there are there's a lot of sub groups within that southern voter let's start with the rural\nPopulation traditionally has been conservative\nGOP however you look at issues as it relates to now with the tariffs and and and the increases that may not be an issue now because you work things out with Canada maybe not China yet for the first things out with Canada and Mexico this the rural vote who wins here\nThat's going to be difficult because I think if again what resonates and so part of it is\nThe candidates both have initiated programs more Internet connections that so I mean that's a minimal really so you're saying will offer more access to Internet\nBut they need to be in connection with the major cities that are in close proximity how above it making connections so if you live in a rural area close to Augusta making savannah Atlanta what connections can be made I think that's more substantive but that's not was being argued were playing to the most base interest\nIn one of the Kennedys I've even read talks about maintaining\nTheir traditional views and traditional but that's an old conversation even from Reagan traditional values which is coded language well\nAnd the more mature voter is listening for the particular is in this regard what are you going to do with our school how are you going to develop our schools is the amount of money allocated for schools going to be reduced voter property taxes because we know that creates a symmetrical system\nAnd so now I'm In rural Georgia property taxes are disproportionately lower than over here and bucket right the issue is how do we now bring our educational structures up to competitive levels and I think that's very important but this is the educated voter and how you become educated the candidates\nNeed to educate individuals on how these things play out if you vote and so the problem is most people as was stated they don't have fundamental reasons to vote if they can't see their interest rent\nBeing represented I've had people emailed me say well I Want to vote my conscious as opposed to vote for either the two major political parties and then you see these these fights on social media well that's why this is what you see that's why\nHillary Clinton lost because folks voted heck I mean these are actual social media fights that you say we want to say well I voted my conscious ... of the major political party what's your response to that\nThat's coded language again you're looking for certain social you should write a book that link goes [laughter]\nOr or tested I mean because the propaganda is what they didn't hear their issue and that social\nAs was stated do what did you say about abortion what about education what about safety one about hospitals because again upper middle class people are not going to ask the same questions because worst case scenario they can pay private school\nI can go to emergency room and proud of my pocket right I mean this is a fundamental problem so when they articulating their political platforms it needs to be understood the individuals without certain resources are who you try to\nTell you are saying you should want you to vote for the greater good as opposed to the self interest\nI don't think those are dissident concepts I think they can coexist okay problem is is not being clarified part of the responsibility of electoral process and the elected official is to inform we've gotten informing\nInforming the populace about what boats do how they function and the allocated responsibilities of the respect of office\nWe don't do that so I'd rather have an ignorant and the purest sense\nConstituency that assumes that I can do it I Can't and I promised them does\nRight that's what you do so even in the governor's race you look at promise of the problem is up to promise and oftentimes these issues of broken down by county a hundred and fifty nine county you know it doesn't work that way so they'll say we advocate for education no what specifically does the governor's office do in education what role does the government I mean does the governor place\nDon't tell me you advocate for new taxes what does it mean and so again you play to the ignorance\nAnd the benefit is allowed them to ascribe a value to this amorphous concept and they'll vote that's when they bought their interest because they defined the categories such that it's ill defined by me allow markets to just to put whatever tag or they want and they vote for that even though I won't do it for their stock or\nSomeone who wants to vote to conscious as\nYour response to that\nI Would hope that it would be a conscience that would be educated in informed by what actually is going on and I think the issue is that just as such Davis was saying that\nWe haven't gotten to tell people why it is that we have to vote by lots of people say to me all the time when you do political scientist oh I hate politics [laughter]\nReally well are you interested in what the tuition is at the different public universities are you interested in why it is the roads aren't working in the place that you are you interested in and they'll say well of course like okay well how do you think you'll see that\nI don't know how do I vote right these are the things that are handled by the people in government that's what the government does is they are in charge of how is money allocated throughout the rural hospitals rural hospital close it's because the state has determined money\nShouldn't go there anymore and it should go somewhere else if roads aren't being fixed and they're being fixed in another place it's because the government has decided to fix the roads in this area and not fix the roads in that area and the way for us to be able to have a say in that is well to vote and to speak out empty contact our representatives and I think\nWhat we've done over time as we've forgotten about that part of it most people don't realize that that's how these decisions are being made and so [noise]\nAdmittedly I'm not entirely sure what it means to vote your conscience um I guess it's to vote I Am actually not true without\nGetting emails about this and I will for them to you I appreciate that 'cause I\nWould like to know what I mean I Would say that if your conscience is hopefully find determining the person who's going to do the best job for the outcomes that we mean then okay\nWell you bought your preconceived notions\nBrought to the table before anyone informed\nAnd we started this conversation talking about the confirmation or whether or not he will be confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh\nThe FBI investigation continues this week regardless of what happens how again as we wrap up professor ... we'll just have a major effect on November ... or even if there's something inconclusive as they say and it's still just word against word\nI think where the impact could be is and again I'm not sure that it's necessarily going to I think it could have a wide ranging impact but I think we're the impact is really going to be is on individual races so there are currently\nA hundred and Ninety team female challengers running in the house Ninety seven of them are down is twenty two of them are Republicans and I would imagine that for a lot of those female challengers an important question is going to be [noise]\nWere you in support of\nKavanaugh's nomination I think we're going to see the same thing in the Senate races that that's going to become an issue and that we're going to be seeing that talk to and so that might be on some level what propels there to be even more of these female challengers being successful than we might sort of otherwise predict\nBecause they're able to capitalize on that issue\nPrecedent is with it I think it will be important to the degree to which on opposing sides if we barbecued and say those who advocate for about four\nOr Kevin ... is going to come down to which side is going to be galvanize and encouraged to use their vote\nAs their voice because right now what you find that gives you finding anger on both sides which anger is going to lead the voting that's what's important to you you can be angry and your library at home that's fine but it's going to come down to the polls so who's so much who's who's upset to the degree to which they're now going to go and hit the streets and vote\nI think that's where it's going to come down because I hear both sides argument you hear protesters on both sides the issue is how many of those individuals believed the voting matters\nThat wasn't that that will have some extended implications for the possibility of another Kavanaugh to come along later and again we have to educate people what does it mean to vote will now you see it all these men are up you're making a decision about the legitimacy of a woman who's made a claim that's problematic\nAnd is not inherently problematic but ostensibly is a problem because we were hoping to some of these men have the moral ... that they can look beyond gender of themselves and say whether or not this matters to them somebody's voice crying saying this is a problem so again the bottom line is\nWhich side is so angered they're now going to say I'm going to vote and take the French the polls way I'm take their friends\nYour Davis professor philosophy and African American studies at Morehouse College also Amy ... professor of political science at Georgia State University Thank you both for this engaging conversation I very much Frank humorous\n[noise]\nNow we also asked voters here in Georgia what issues were important to them take a listen\nBiggest issue I guess for me is gun laws of and two three year olds\nThat will be entering school at some\nPoint just the fear of [noise]\nOf guns and what's happened that are passed so that that would be the most important issue to\n... for me and protecting Planned Parenthood at Enron right\nConservative spending who's going to\nHave Washington ... spend less money at a federal level but probably spend a little bit more money locally someone who\nI feel is more in tune with those of us that are in the middle versus extreme right or left\nSo that concerns me a lot that we can and so does this and this country and I think there's a lot of us that feel so concerned that we're moving once Russia yeah there and shouldn't be that way 'cause I think the majority of us are silent\nTherapies integration of working class size is important to many of\nThe most part I mean we live in the southwest Atlanta neighborhood and Lucy the neighborhood of this\nAnd we're not going to use the word or however it's happening\nI guess one of the main issues is like urban development and transportation but also like not leaving people behind in that process\nAs seems to happen in general as I say develops like the poor people get left behind so mainly Atlanta made their shoes 'cause that's just where I live but also the rest of the state needs to be taken care of his that's his on\nImmigration and how they view it in the state especially with things like the detention centers like ones that are in Georgia in Lincoln county I Know there's a big one there is going to have a handle that definitely has had environment\nAnd I think that makes an impact about what kinds of decisions about restrictions on emissions and Georgia and that's what I've been thinking about", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "01"}
