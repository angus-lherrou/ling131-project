MacArthur fellows and more information or Mac found dot org and the listeners who support this NPR station\nYou'll listening to a broadcast from earlier today [noise]\nWelcome to this Wednesday edition of closer look I'm Rose Scott we'll begin with is yet another poll has been released in fact\nTwo new polls from the University of Virginia's Center for politics\nIt shows close races in two high profile open seats southern contests a tendency Senate race in Georgia's gubernatorial race between secretary of state Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams\nNow according to the ... it's just UVA Center for politics poll camp and aprons are basically tied with camp at forty seven percent in ... that forty six percent now this online poll was conducted in English from October forth to the eleventh\nAnd respond it's we're likely Georgia voters some other findings the top issues for Georgia voters\nHealthcare come in at Seventeen percent and the economy at sixteen percent and according to the polls relates to health care forty two percent of those likely voters feel that Abrams has a better policy as opposed to thirty eight percent for Kim\nThey're more numbers for immigration forty six percent field at camp as a better policy compared to thirty six percent feel that ...\nPolicy you falling all these numbers folks and among those likely Georgia voters fifty one percent say they approve the way president Donald Trump is handling his job well forty eight percent say they disapprove\nWork and reform adding in and kind of putting and underneath this larger umbrella really and live in the work and and started people stopped trying to avoid it and started being interested in taking classes now our classes fill up and like\nNo time and we put up our classes for the year just put up some extra ones the other week and they are already failed so\nPeople realize that this is really worthwhile and and that they want\nTo to do this work and so that that\nUh reconstructing the work started are getting us notoriety around the country and before I knew it people were calling me from all over the place where people come in here from Chicago in from New Orleans from the Episcopal communities saying help\nUs figure out how to get out of work going with more life\nAnd so who are the participants in the workshop are they mostly people safe from within the Episcopal community\nAnybody who's a leader in the Episcopal Church so and priests and deacons have cannot be ordained until they've taken this work\nAnd they get a great like no no they just get credit for having done it and that if it actually makes gave me a sea [laughter] no they don't get grades it's it's not great but um [noise]\nSo anybody who is on a vest remember which is the leaders of the way our church leadership works or if you're on a search committee really if you're a Sunday school teacher if you're a parish administrator any\nJob that you have that's considered to be leadership you are supposed to take this Maryland racism class because the idea was to get the leaders up to speed so they can and um get the parishes up to speed\nAnd so so our focus I mean we're pits aliens our focus is it a ... couple constituency but we've had people come\nFrom the Methodist Church we've had a high people come we have had atheists come to our classes because they've heard about the classes and they wanted to come and we don't we're not going to turn anybody away so anybody who wants to come as welcome but we don't promote the work\nOutside of our own constituency because they had fifty six thousand Episcopalian in Atlanta so I used to tell the commission that's a big enough constituency for me if we can impact that group I'll be happy the commission morphed into the center because we outgrew being a commission\nWe were doing all this work all over the country and just a little group of volunteers and so\nThe bishops said you know you all of outgrown being a commission and I said you know you're right we have and I was just I was falling tearing I I was not being paid nobody was being paid would end and I was working like forty fifty hours a week as a volunteer\nSo because I was retired and knew what to do I could do it but you cannot expect volunteers to be the the to get this work\nAnd not the way it really needs to be done so I when the bishops said um\nHe thought we had outgrown ourselves I said you're right and so then I wrote to the presiding bishop bishop curry and said we want to start a center would you be interested in supporting that and he said he was\nAnd so we are now not just for Atlanta but the center for the whole church which is all of the United states and eleven countries [noise]\nAnd so if I had any sense I Would not have taken this job because that's a huge amount of of a responsibility but I feel like that you just take a step at a time and you just go forward so the work is we've already work now\nAll the way to Honduras which is province nine in our church the Latin America and province\nAnd I was just in Honduras a month ago working with folks there and then across the country and working with people in Iowa and Tennessee in Texas I just all over\nAnd so it and it's just you know it's one phone call one workshop one speech one conversation at a time and it doesn't matter whether it's here or in Honduras but I looked at our scope and\nIn one year we can we mapped out ourselves than we are working here in the diocese we're working in the southeast which is our province for they were working nationally because we're in all these other dioceses across the country and internationally in Honduras\nAnd also in Guyana we are our\nDiocese is uh is has a sister relationship with Cape ... so we will be doing some\nWe've had people go and they are radio pilgrimages but we'll be doing some work with ... as well so I'm pretty excited about that and you know to be to be this retired African American studies professor who did this work for\nAll these years and now have this chance to be here and bring those skills and that passion and and sense of intention allergic to this work under this umbrella is a real gift\nYou do a lot of work with faith leaders mhm I'm curious what questions are what are those familiar questions that you get from them\nHandily maneuvering navigating through the racism space when it intersects with I once religion or one safe and you're a leader mhm what do they want\nWell one thing people say to be more than I Wish I Would hear is how hard it is to have a conversation about race and I just want to say yeah but you know\nYou just have to start and so we actually host conversations on race where we've set up panels and and help people see how you can do that because it's a matter of\nHaving the courage to do it first of all so um the other thing that comes up a lot as we don't know what to do\nYou know here we are and we know that the church is not where it needs to be and we know racism is running rampant all over the place and we just don't know what to do and I\nI Try to help people refrain refrain that question it's not that you don't know what to do is that you don't have the courage to do what you do know you need to do\nBecause it's not it doesn't take long to figure out that racism is wrong\nAnd and that the church if anywhere there's an equity we need to be speaking to it now you have to decide if you have the courage to do it and be willing to suffer whatever the consequences are so if you were a priest and you end up on Sunday Morning and preach about\nThe inequities and the the wrongness of racism they're going to be people in the few who don't like it and they're going to be people who stopped paying their pledges then who go to some of the church where they don't have to hear that kind of sermon so that's those are the for me that's really the bigger bigger issue and so\nBy here behind many of those kinds of questions are laments I hear an issue about courage about you know I'm I'm\nI Do this really you're asking do I have the courage to go on this journey the way I Need to because now you're beginning to see is a journey to go on\nAnd but do I have the courage to do it so one of the things we've done here is invited people from around the country\nTo come to Atlanta and let's have a conversation about what are you doing what do you wish you were doing how things going what kind of community of support do you have because it's hard to stand up\nAnd take it that the kind of risk that needs to be taken if you don't feel like there is anybody going on a journey with you and so some of these some of our people are out in\nYou know a little church way out somewhere in South Georgia and the the priest is going to stand up on Sunday Sunday morning and talk about racism and everybody in the room is white and nobody wants to hear it it takes some it takes a little more than just thinking that's a good thing to do I mean you need a community of support\nAnd you need to have come to terms with\nWhat it is what it is you feel how to do and how do you want to live that call out and so I think that um\n[noise] I I'm we're offering a service to help people\nFeel emboldened to to tell the truth and that's what that's what I hear a lot from like all over the country in the back of the question of I don't know what to do or what do we do how do we start a conversation is how do I do this work and survive\nYou know how to do this work and get to stay a priest or a deacon or\nKeep my job and you know because I Know I Know church people they they don't like what they don't like something they ... the first thing they do is could given their money and then if you get enough of them doing that it affects everything and then they go somewhere else because they can you know we did a lot of folks who think these\nIf you go somewhere else you can find a different message I don't know what Jesus they have in mind 'cause last time I checked there was the same one everywhere but they seem to think there's you know across town you can get a different version of Jesus and maybe you can but I just feel like that that is a fear\nOr underneath the the most of the questions that come\nGiven the current political space where in one might want to counter that political space has been spring a lot of tension discourse in our nation\nI see the role of faith leaders and we're going to know the intersection politics mhm\nYou know if you think about you have you have to think about who what what is it that you're saying you believe in and Jesus was really\nOut there on the cutting edge speaking about wrong and calling\nThen you because that's how you begin to build courage you know you you've got to enter thing that makes you stand against injustice I mean that's that's what I that's a piece of wood healing is about that no I can no longer tolerate injustice because there's nothing in me that will agree to it and\nRight now we have a whole lot of people who just walking along the fleet so they're willing to agree to whatever is is bad so and let me just say ...\nPlay that folks want to come on November second the event starts at nine thirty here at the center and they need to go to the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta's website to register and registration is limited\nSo powerful day indeed yes Dr Catherine make thank you so much for taking the time thank you for inviting closer look to the center thank you for coming thank you [noise] um\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to sing dance [noise] I don't think he wants to hear that there's a reason we're playing it because you know everybody got a part of what the ... the man who you are seen bringing up Jake\nWhere were you know everybody\nTried to sing the song and it was everybody's wedding song [laughter] coming up with\nJust a moment we're going to have a fun conversation with the legendary people Bryson but until then

and WABC dot org and Jan Barry joins me and jammed before we started seeing it's not I celebrate my love you're a ... another conversation\nA conversation it's not always easy conversations about race but we'll be able to go beyond just conversation about race and racism so talking to Dr Katherine makes about\nRacial healing mhm it's a conversation that people are rarely talk about yeah give me uncomfortable yeah but it's the next steps the next step right so having those conversations with what we do here yeah I think it it's\nThis whole show both segments out that um the conversation you just had and then when you have coming up are so indicative of the ...\nThat you cover on this show and that you go deep on things you have conversations that are hard to have you have conversations that are fun to have\n'em and it's that range that I think makes people like myself and like so many of our listeners love and support that show and to help they continue please don't actually support the shell by Clinton W ... dot org or calling six seven eight five five to eight Ninety Ninety I think our\nGoals for the hours Twenty one place and it's when you run and we're halfway there and if you don't pledge people Bryson's gonna retire\nAs soon as you know vice funny about racism though it's a different reality for this generation to generation that have to endure it now it's a different kind of racism that's absolutely a it's a it's it's odd that I mean\nA racism it has to have a has to be fueled by something yes you know and and but it's not inherit joined nature or to the nature of human beings and and this is what I found him I'm old enough to have been born in segregation and this\nIs totally different I like my racism straight up with no chaser\nNow we're doing a lot of what else do we want to talk about all that\nSo in conversations like and I'm so honored to have Mr Bryson here he says the calling people but you know I'm very hard we're going to have we're never going

dot com come sign up\nAnd we have lunch and talk and build and strategize about how we start to build the safety net in Atlanta and of course one thing I've learned as a Brooklyn I coming to Atlanta that you always have to say parking is free and that's very interesting cultural difference\nLet's talk about troop ... let's be specific because this is what we call freelance insurance now covers injuries and accidents what exactly are we talking about a year\nYeah so uh let me just say first that ... has a disability plan and with our partner or Ga we provide a very short term disability so that let's say you have you've broken your leg and you are a massage therapist and you can't put weight on it\nYou can't work what if you work with your hands and you break your arm what if you have that kind of pneumonia that gets so bad you can't take your laptop into bed with you and work which is why I freelancers do way too often and so those are the kinds of things that are covered\nIt's the unexpected things that hit people which is why you want to ensure\nGeorgia as one of the I guess the the first market for years since\nI think George is one of the most exciting freelancer places in the country there are just so many new emerging fields from film and television creative technology to having the big headquarters of\nCoke and FedEx and all these big companies are using freelancers and\nIt's just a place that's really affordable\nCreative they are moving there from the coasts in record numbers and I really think that when you spend a lot of time with freelancers they're kind of the ultimate crafts\nPeople they really are about excellence and the culture that they create is uh I I find one of the most exciting ones in in the country and not just exciting but solid ... if you couldn't believe that people have to rely on each other to do well\nAnd so freelancers teach us these lessons about taking care of one another and coming together and in Georgia this is this is the place this is like the ... Center for it\nWell let's talk about the true bowl in terms of you are making sure you have your you know you started freelancers union so now you're offered this short term disability so let's talk about\nTroop all in terms of making sure you are including everything that a freelancer might need in that short term disability who some of the consultants who are you working with and and you know to make sure that\nThis is just like any other short term disability we see the commercials with the little duck\nYou know you know so\nThat that's a great question so let me just say first of all this doesn't exist anywhere you you actually can't get that there is a longer term disability that others can getting typically they get it through their job that this is really saying freelancers face a very short term risk\nSo we the team at who uh came from the freelancers union were season we've built\nInsurance companies before we work with the top actuaries in the country\nAnd we work with our Ga our partner and their actuaries and so we have built a product\nThat is designed around freelancers as every freelancer knows one of the worst moments is interacting with insurance and finance 'cause you're made to feel weird well that's really about it too [laughter] that's true right\nAh but what is what we've tried to do is at ... dot com and it's spelled T R U P oh is that you come on it's a really easy process designed around people who have episodic income\nAnd we know that that's the hardest thing for freelancer so we said hey we know that's a problem we know your income goes up and down you have terrible dry spells and that's a good year rate\nBut what we've done is said during those periods we're going to have an affordable plan\nYou pay that monthly and then if something like this happens it covers you after one week and it will pay you fifty percent of your earning so you can pay your rent you can pay groceries just to keep you going so you can get back to work which is what freelancers want to do\nThe voice you here's Sara Horowitz she's the founder of the freelancers union but now we're talking about truthful and ensure it's an inch so I called it an insurance product a short term disability product is that a good way of the year for freelance workers and it was recently launched here in Georgia nicer I Want to ask\nYou about also mental health did you do you have a desert is a component of this plan and also covers mental health\nYes yes so it's if you think about it as\nIt's not for like the regular problems or like you know I'm tired and I want to take a paid week off or I see my therapist once a week it's really designed if you have a a serious mental health incident that as cover what about\nAn overdose\nOr in the face of opioids and you know prescription medicines\nDoes this play out in okay it's when so what what happens is if something happens you go to your health professional a doctor or a physician's assistant a nurse practitioner and they have to verify that this is happening and then that's the kind of thing that's covered\nAnd so like insurance you know if you think about like a hurricane insurance it's designed for that\nThat situation that can happen to you and you want to protect your assets so it's income protection so that you don't end up bankrupt\nEarn credit card debt or wearing and you know what I found with freelancers as we all know that you're told you put forty cents in a checking account and sixty cents and your savings account to pay for your taxes and your benefits so people know that\nAlready saving like three hundred dollars a month for these kinds of emergencies or they worry that they should\nAnd when we come together and insurance it means you don't have to save that much you just have to have the premium so that if that\nHappens you're covered and then you have the extra money that maybe you should put in your retirement or saving up for um a down payment on something\nAnd so what we're really talking about it to pose is how do you build your safety net ... personally and then you start to build that together and that's why we love to have people come and join us at ...\nFor lunches let's be clear though about some some some conditions or you know we lack of better were some things that aren't covered planned eve plans leaving pregnancy that is not covered correct\nYeah so what uh is covered typically in a longer term disability would be maternity or or the ... the ability to to go when you're when you're pregnant 'cause this is designed around one week to twelve week so that wouldn't be covered\nA regular mental health visits for therapy wouldn't be covered\nI'm a plastic surgery or elective surgery would not be covered it's really the bigger emergencies and your uh in your life and I went to an end and you can go through that it if you go to ... dot com you can see what's covered and what is your party clearly\nBecause you'll have something you you cite is dangerous behavior\nHow would you define it like you know if you are a\nI don't know you you teach sky diving [laughter] what would I what do you consider do you mean give me an example of dangerous behavior\nYeah I mean I think it's something that is just that puts yourself regularly and in harm's way like that would be an example and a sport or in a it's something that you would choose to do and like\nIt or a magicians assistant and where he you know takes the blades and puts you in half\nAn hour stuff ... by assuming let's say you're a magician didn't didn't know know how to do that one but sword swallowing might come\nTo mind it's you know it it sounds you know we're I'm laughing but people should know you know be very exact in terms of because when I hear this segment\nYou know you have a lot of people that will want to know more so getting information out as important I Want to end up doing because as you said look\nTwenty twenty seven the majority of

H. B. E. Atlanta choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott you know there's a reason why we're playing that that version that instrumental will get that in a moment because for every Ron well there's a reason right so we're going to go back to Sunday may for two thousand and eight\nMile belonged to read for those of you who are younger and don't know the old school you know the\nWords of this race philosopher and mistake that says mother mother there too many of you crying ... brother brother brother Jeff fall too many of you dying you know we've got to find a way\nTo bring some love and you know today that's\nAll the fall though we don't need to escalate for war is not the end so\nThe only love can conquer hate\nThat is the Reverend Dr Dwight Andrew delivering a Sunday sermon like he has for so many times that first congressional church here in Atlanta since Nineteen Ninety nine to be exact however\nRuben Andrews is celebrating and being celebrated as he reaches forty years of ministry and mission\nSo we turned today's conversation to religion fate politics and the journey of the river in Dr ... white Andrews welcome sir it's great to be with you and what a wonderful piece to begin with I said man get revenue using Marvin Gaye and service\nAll right that's Marvin is a he is the philosopher yeah well as the domestic and really in in some way to kind of profit\nRight now I'm In the music that he spoke to really twenty five thirty years ago was describing right where we are still resonates day\nNow want to clear some up because of that land folks have rumors you are not retiring oh no I'm just celebrate need for for decades right\nThat's right I mean not dead yet I still got a few more decades ago but\nWe're celebrating this as a time when I look back over the last forty years\nAnd I was ordained on Martin Luther king's birthday January Fifteen Nineteen Seventy eight\nSo we just thought this would be a perfect time to celebrate these first for decades or and also to commemorate Dr King and his vision for the love community and really to begin the next chapter first congregation of church save just celebrate a hundred and fifty years on the the oldest black church second\nIn the in congressional in the nation correct that's right\nSecond congregation will church second oldest exactly\nIn that clip that I played a Reverend because you went on to talk about the role of the black church and and that's why I like to begin our conversation because as you mentioned your again in Nineteen Seventy eight you see then and now is that the black church that rule the same as it evolved is it involving has not evolved enough\nI think that the the St potential existed in Nineteen Seventy eight that exist today but I think for black churches we have the struggle of being relevant and being kind of self critical of where we are and how we're doing\nAnd in many ways I think that this is a difficult in sad time because I don't think to black churches responded as well as they could to the really difficult challenges of the day you know it's it was easier when people would say whites only a and so the issues of segregation and\nThe kinds of oppression that we're really in a parent\nOr now much more um subverted and so I think our challenges are the same but I think we've underestimated the nature of up to challenge\nWho do you think then I don't want to say is responsible for she'll eat the black folks or any folks hold accountable is it the faith leader in the church is\nNo I don't think so and it's not to let the faith leader off the hook I think the issues that we all share a mutual responsibility to one another\nAnd in fact that's what excites me about the black church and the ideas that we're all in the struggle together and the tradition that I grew up in the congregation of tradition everyone saw themselves as a as a worker a cultural worker a spiritual worker bee\nAnd so if you think about the great leaders in our tradition like Andy young uh Andy always saw himself is really just a part of the the work and and not as the leader per se\n[noise] you know last night I moderated a conversation already MRI scan and chapel and I asked the question to the panel about the definition of moral leadership when they ask you that question how you define it\nWell I think I think a moral leadership is really a decisions in a way of processing decisions and living are based on a moral center\nAnd for many years to black church a had a moral center because they believed in social justice and witness not because it was a political idea but that's what Jesus taught to love your neighbors know strangers to share whatever is had that there might be enough\nAnd I think it's that vision that provides for the moral leaders and moral leadership the real interesting thing is that in some ways I think the leadership has been corrupted\nIf you will by um by commerce I by the president age in which a leadership has become so pragmatic so we don't think about principle\nAnd so I'm Still trying to find a way to stay on the principal because I think that's what brought me here\nWell let's talk about bringing you here because I I played some Motown era earlier and you're from the motor as they call it that's where I D and you're quite musician I'm let folks know because you were in his band called seven sounding make manual for parliament fundamentalists right you were hanging out with George Clinton\nWouldn't call here now [laughter]\nBecause you know the funny part about about those days is I thought that um that George Clinton in parliament I thought that they were really not going to ever be anything because they were just too wild\nToo far out they were wearing diapers and\nVote gains in army belts and here we are loving ship with land the mother ship was an addict but we had matching ... church and bell bottoms and so I thought we was a way forward but look [laughter] ah but they were very instructive because George I mean they really were pointing to the future\nOh man it's we could have a whole nother come yes but I Want to ask you about then we always talk about with someone has a ha moment or the call to serve in that calling inside of you was it even then president when you were in the seventh sounds and you know we're into frills bell bottoms\nI think it was a the calling was beginning and I'm In some ways it took a long time to unfold for me um it definitely started in the days that I was rehearsing was my rock and roll band and the church basement but it was really the pastor of the church was so busy doing things in the community", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "18"}
