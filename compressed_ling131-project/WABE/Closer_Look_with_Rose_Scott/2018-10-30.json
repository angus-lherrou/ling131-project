the U.S postal inspection service this continues our conversation today on those who look at the special closer looking in a moment a conversation with rabbi Peter Berg of the temple\nDo you navigate through all that and your own personal feelings I mean you you you're emotional well I'm not saying let me back up on one project that on you\nBut you're correct that this has been one of the most difficult periods\nYou've got to be ... or you also have to reconcile with whatever you dealing\nWith and we support each other we have a a a large a clergy team in our congregation and we spend time supporting each other and a pastor into each other and and caring for each other\nAnd that is true of the of the interfaith community here there are so many ministers an e moms and rabbis in Atlanta um that that are part of my inner circle really part of my family\nAnd uh and and we support each other and I think that all of us are going to share a very similar message with our communities\nThis

remembrance at our regular Shabaab worship this Friday evening as well\n... we are in a political climate in elections coming up but how do you navigate through all of that and trying to stay out of the politics of it but do you get a message to your kind of gets about not say who to vote for but\nMaybe they get a little deeper in terms of which candidate to support\nWhy I Do tell everyone to vote all the time as it's it's so important that every whoever you whoever you want to vote for being ... or so I I don't feel that it's my role to uh to endorse candidates I'm I feel that it's my role as a rabbi ... to make sure everybody votes for whoever they want to vote for\nA would be to work very strongly on the issues so what I Do is develop a relationship with political ah and civic leaders of all parties in all backgrounds so that when an issue arises\nUm I can I have a relationship and I'm able to work with them uh and and I this is something that I'll be doing in the coming

know they have you been in touch with some people up in Pittsburgh they've you who have spoken to and what did you say\nWe've spoken to some of the leaders of the community in Pittsburgh to offer our profound condolences\nSometimes there's very little that one can say a except to say that that we love them and we're here for them in Atlanta not just the Jewish community but Atlanta stands behind them in with them\nOr in their grief are and that we will roll up our sleeves and work every day to create a better world for our children and our children's children\nI Can't tell you how many times

on groups and organizations\nThat identifies either publishing are spreading messages of racism discrimination sexism or anti religious narrative\nKeegan Hanks is a senior research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center he joined now in Studio ... thank you very much for having me [noise]\nOften people say well the media needs to get fat so we're going to talk about facts were going to give people facts and you all that is your job to to track in and make sure you all have the facts\nRight um but I Want to begin with something on your website right now because it reads as our nation grapples with yet another mass shooting we must look closely as wide as hate fueled violence is contaminating our society\nThen it goes on to say the social media postings of the alleged shooter provide a chilling but unfortunately expected answer\nWhat's the answer kicking well I mean what we see is that this individual was spinning a ton of time on lives steeped being and racist and conspiratorial postings\nAnd when I was in many ways just a product of this divisive rhetoric we see at all different levels of society from the very bottom where you have organized take groups trying to grow this in to our communities all the way to the top where we have you been our political leaders in this day and age thing incredibly\nA harmful and demeaning and damaging things about vulnerable populations in our country\nYou are on track the activity of these groups this kind of hard to track the activities of individuals' um even with some people as you know they were surprised to learn that was his other social media site called gab\nUntil this happened so ... is there a way to start tracking what people are are saying in in putting on in social media because their private accounts there's just no way right\nIt's incredible ... incredibly difficult and there's a whole team of us who do this and we struggle to keep up every single day I mean the truth of the matter is increasingly when we see these tragedies unfold we don't know the individual we aren't familiar with them before they go and kind of perpetrators files and what it points to for us is\nYou know the real risk involved with this unchecked hate on many of these online platforms that also even in a broader than that just in general conversation society\nFolks will say well listen free speech people are entitled to opinion you know just because someone type something and puts it on their posts whether it's whether whatever social media outlet it is\nYou can't really you you you can't\nIn any way stop that you have any unfortunately someone say well if they until they do something\nBut what's your response to is their responsibility to for the social media that Twitter is a Facebook any Facebook is trying to and there's so many other social media platforms that we don't know about do they have a responsibility to monitor and look for this type of language in there that\nThey absolutely have a moral responsibility to monitor this and do a better job of not a legal\nNot a legal one but a moral one you know I think gab is an excellent example this is the social media platform that we saw Robert powers\nYou know engaging all this terrible rhetoric on kind of what he actually posted on in the moments before you went and committed this atrocity you know this is a social media platform that was basically designed to harbor extremists that had been thrown off of other platforms\nBut doesn't mean those extremists are going to go back on to the other platforms but this is an example of what not checking this rhetoric and not controlling what's being posted on your side can lead to one it's allowed to steep and faster late to terrible consequences\nThe owner of gab dot com told NPR this morning or at least at least they played It's MORNING where he said look you know I Can't it's hard for me to determine whether or not when someone says and I'm paraphrasing here I'm going in what that means that you know they're not you they can't be held responsible for that\nYeah well at the same time you know this individual who founded the site explicitly because of this conspiracy about liberal censorship on other sites\nPacks of hate or on the rise the nation has shaken by days of religious racial and political violence hate crimes are nothing new but it's just what happens when conspiracy theories enter the mainstream how should America respond and what should you do\nNext time on one ad tonight at ten on Ninety point one W. A. B. [noise]\nOh\nAnd a closer look continues now here in Ninety point one W. H. B. E. Atlanta choice for NPR News I'm Rose Scott earlier today president Donald Trump tweeted the following quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame\nNow of course is that the first time in probably the last time Mr Trump will convey a message of disdain for the news media but it also it's indicative of the current time when it comes to the intersection of political rhetoric and free speech\nYou don't want to hand marriages doing ours with us\nAnd you don't get the power to an angry left wing mob and that's what I\nMean come on stream and dangerous to govern\nWhen Paul believing the rule of law\nNot the rule of them all\nHis time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be as dedicated as they are to be committed to say on the show always has been all over you know she always says you know when they go low we\nMay go low we can\nWith this new Democratic Party is about I Do\nRegular word to the mid term pitch that uh the United states of America specializes in vilify black and brown people I Do know that they were Democrats\nTo take it to the polls take oh there's one in the polls but the history of this country to\nHow many examples would you like me to give you about how you can you give ... thing that is not it's not a very shower hitched fix sixteen Nineteen next year in Nineteen Ninety it'd be for a number of years since the\nFirst Africans were brought to this continent as slave so it's not a pitch is a reality in this country and the fact that you're taking such a cavalier attitude about the suffering a black and brown people in this country is appalling I was watching the\nNews footage this morning what did I see I saw women and children okay and I'm going to tell you people that I don't care if the women for children anyone coming out the door [noise]\nShould be shot on site they should be shot exiting the store if they make it down the street just\nTake their after and shoot him in the back that's right and bill em [noise] I got I got around with your name on it\nFor them to make sure we show\nHad a son that cabinet and\nStation\nSo what happens when all of that spurs on action in sometimes even violence or is that statement even accurate will join me on the line from entering universities professor and sing a burden senior lecturer film and media studies joining me in Studio ... professor you Elaine ... beach\nAnd associate professor of political science at Georgia State university and our social media and social justice ... drive bus dot com ... thank you I Know someone that audio was tough to listen to but that's the space that we're in and so when I say there's a lot to unpack here it is what we'll do our best\nI Want to go back to even today President Trump's tweets\nAbout the news media and professor I'll start with you um is that part of the problem in terms of who's saying that there is great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open obvious hostility report the news accurately and family\nOf course it's a problem but I Want to go even further back and I take issue with a little bit of the framing with which this segment started out some of the uh audio that you showed he's just not the same you mean putting together\nA arguments for violence arguments for shooting people in the store or not the same as putting forward arguments for voting arguments for respecting people arguments for respecting the history of slavery so I think\nWhen we look at a President Trump's statement this morning it's a statement where she talks about the press being the enemy of the people this beyond just political disagreement or political arguments this is about the highest institution in the land arguing that people like yourself who are doing their jobs and the enemy of the people this is the real problem\nAnd for that audio we have to be fair because depending on which side you're on they they all have the same issue with who said what and what they said and they all said this in from their opinion is inciting the base and inciting possibly folks to go beyond just the narrative so\nYou'd have to be fair about it whether you agree with either side or not but\nBoth sides and it's also about free about free speech too so I Can't control what people say but I Do think we have an obligation to be fair about what's put out in the public and how people take that in so that's what ... and that's part I'm Sorry go ahead and I think the press a button [laughter] yeah um and that's part of the challenge\nUm that we face and and I'm a you'll end up raised a very good issues as part of the challenge is determining what qualifies as in cities with qualifies as insightful you know the fact that people can ... are in America feel comfortable\nUh comparing someone who is talking about the enslavement of black people to\nSomeone who's talking about the elimination of killing and killing a black people is the problem you know I'm so you are correct in terms of people I'm seeing these different uh snippets that you you put together a soundbite that you put together\nA through their personal ... but the lens through which we see the world um is an ideological one and the idiot logical lands that is pervasive\nUm which is driving the violence is one of white supremacy paternal is um and the idea or as your previous guest said I'm from the Southern Poverty Law Center that um there should be only a white ethno state\nAnd so you can't you as a false equivalency to put all of those things together um even though you are right um in terms of how people are viewing the um through their ... is he a logical lenses and unfortunately what's happening is\nYou know synagogues or getting shot to black churches are getting shot up black people are getting executed and Kroger parking lot because we can't deduce I'm In ... when I say we I think the majority of us cannot deduced or determine the difference between someone who's standing up for um their rights to be president and here\nI'm versus someone who's standing up for their right to eliminate those who they don't think should be president or here other than in a in a position of subjugation\nProfessor I'm going to bring you back on the conversation I mean it's a ... but when people take political rhetoric and then it then they transfer that's transfer that to their social media platform and then it turns into\nPossibly an act of violence than therein lies the problem which is why we're having this conversation about how how do you what are you said is that what do you say to people about understanding political rhetoric and then taking it to speak to your social media platforms\nI think the problem that we have now is that ah from the highest institutions in this country there's a direct call to violence so we have moved beyond just the political rhetoric political speeches people say all sorts of things in rallies we have north from that to the president in states and a lot of the leaders in his party\nArguing in a dish humanizing ...\nAgainst others talking about migrants caravans attacking invading talking about infestation of our country\nUsing completely insane conspiracy theories about philanthropy slug George Soros and argue that somehow it's this source conspiracy and so you no longer have only people being radicalized by each other on social media and by chain letters the aunts and uncles sent to Facebook\nBut you have somebody who's the president United States tweeting things that are then inciting people to violence I think we have moved really past beyond just blame it on Facebook\nYou land or we've had you on this program many times\nBecause you are proponent of people using their social media platform but you also at the intersection of social media social justice how do you view on this when it moves from political rhetoric to social media then to something else\nShe was she she was being very diplomatic about all I Know she has more thoughts on them both positive and negative but she tried to stress the positive aspects of each of them\nUm and what kind of candidates they'd be and sort of was assessing them on that she didn't do the negative assessments um but I think what what she was trying to say is there's plenty of people in the in the slate of candidates and all of them would be different essentially\nUm what was really interesting about it to me is that what happens whenever she says anything she obviously as Trump's favorite a person to attack you know among his base\nAt the same time other people who have lost elections and she didn't quite lose this one she lost you didn't lose the popular vote at least\nWhich must be just grading upon her you know always I Would think for the rest of her life she had three million more votes than President Trump yes yes\nSo other candidates who lost to John McCain who's of course passed John Kerry Mitt Romney they all got to speak to speak up now they get to speak up quite loudly and whenever she does Democrats and others decry her for doing so I I find that really unusual and and\nI think she should be able to talk up I think she should be able to say things she wants and then everything she said it shouldn't be parsed quite so much will\nWe're still left with her saying you asked if she would do the heavy lifting you meant I think we\nWill will you run for president I think she heard it as well I help other candidates um she said she wasn't running but she liked to be president and you interpreted that as a writer who wouldn't have wanted to put that much working and be a politician who wouldn't have wanted to be president\nUm but it's still this sort of a cloud of away yeah she meant but you did ask her specifically about a Russian interference in the midterms what did she say\nWell she she had done that because uh right after the election I didn't interview with her where she was sort of a painting the picture of exactly what the mother of the investigation found at the time people had made fun of her for doing that and calling her paranoid and so I wanted to point out that she was entirely right about what she had said about the impact of the Russians\nI unfortunately think we'll never know what the true impact is except that they were there and it had some impact and so she ... she was discussing essentially we were discussing essentially that she was right about what had happened\nAnd what we need to do going forward and she definitely a criticize the social media companies for their role in that problem and wondered whether they were prepared for elections going forward\n[noise] that's ...

legitimate purpose doesn't really have a good mechanism for\nThe victim or their family\nTo address the court system in the event that their rights under the statute are not\nGiven do you\nCare or they're not given the opportunity to be hers\nCenter ... ... ... and ... can you sure give or in a made hopefully this is a fair question how can you give or a painting scenario where that might be the case I'm looking at and I've read through Georgia's current you know bill of rights\nAnd so you're saying it it does not afford to see them or the ... the victim's family to raise some challenges concern can you give me an example\n[noise] well um yes if if you look at the the four main driving points behind\nMartial law as being proposed in the constitution and then the amendment that on the ballot\nThe force is that in the event that your rights if if ah if that your constitutional rights are not honored as your case goes to the court system then you can file a motion with a judge ... alerting the court that\nSome ... I have to either be present be hurt 'em and those are the basic concepts of this you have a right to\nAlert the court that\nThe way I'm supposed to be treated as a victim as I go through this process\nHas not been as the constitution says um and so it it better allows for a in those hopefully rare instances where the prosecutors either for whatever reason the victim is not given notice\nA and as you mentioned with regard to the the example of martial law are and what happened to their family or someone that the the criminal accused the perpetrator was let out on bail and the family was not notified um and that criminal accused currently accused then went\nAnd murdered 'em\nTheir family member or and so\nWhat is contemplated and and then that ... that we have and what is a core concept of the ... law or constitutional amendments across the state\nIs that in the event that the system so to speak doesn't work like it's supposed to ... you have a vehicle to go to the court and asked the judge 'em to alert the judge that you're right hasn't been honored and give you that chance to be heard\nAnd then the court of course the judge a woods fashion whatever up a remedy that he or she is the judge thought was appropriate\nIf you're just joining me I'm joined by Georgia state's Republican Senator John F. Kennedy and we're talking about a minute for on the ballot it's coming up in the upcoming election is known as ... as long as I Want to talk about something that's called the opt in\nAnd and there have been a lot of folks that is kind of confused by that so the final version of martial law\nHas a coat opt in system what does that mean king's birthday down for me\n[noise] well um I guess rose give me a little more context on that that language is found in in in various circumstances can you put something\nAround that so many with that so the ... law which was approved by the house and Senate last march has an opt in system which victims must make known their interest in being informed about the details of a criminal case\nSo deadly wishing for me which victims must make known their interest in being informed about the details of a criminal case one would think that they should if they're the victim or the other families victim that they so they have to opt in and make it known that they're interested in being informed about the details of a\nCriminal case it seems like they should be happening anyway is that not happening\nWell it it should um but let me tell you the the idea behind that and the driver\nI'm not withstanding what we talked about and and the really deep philosophical belief that victims ought to have the right to be heard\nThe important part they're roses they have the right to be or not that they are compelled to be heard or compelled to participate in a in a particular aspect of the criminal trial or the criminal process\nYou can think of circumstances very tragic circumstances where the victim of a crime\nMay in fact not want to participate they may not want to either relive the event or for whatever reason and that ought to be that person's choice so that the opportunities that are being afforded hopefully Morsi's laws passed in the rights that will fast\nThrough our constitution with all of our citizens the right to be heard won't be turned around or turned on its head such that it would be\nA compulsion for the victim to be involved I mean let's remember the the victim or the victim's family if they've been through a lot they've been through enough\nAnd what we want to do is make sure that to the extent they want to participate and to the extent they want to be heard they ought to have that right but you wouldn't want to have the circumstances where they they were forced to does that make\nSense yes well I I on you you explain it\nUh let me ask you this because when I asked earlier about looking at other versions and there are other versions and other states but were you able to borrow any of those important I guess additions that you want it here in Georgia even if it doesn't mirror inexact\nOr in other states exact Mars he's all but there was something you were able to extract from another state that you wanted to put ... did you put in the measure\nI'm sure ... and I think ah for that matter really most of what you find in our version of it are found in most if not all of\nThe other states and again the four concepts our number one that you have a right to be treated with dignity and respect among something we can all all agreed with number two that you have a right to be to to be given notice\nOf what's going on with your case a number three that you have a right to be heard again as we just spoke to with your great question about the often language that if you want to you have the right to be hurt\nAnd then finally the fourth element of it is simply that if in fact one of your rights are not on er\nYou're not allowed to participate or you weren't given notice you have a vehicle to file a motion with a court and bring it to the court tension so that it's addressed timely rather than\nThe case continues on its normal course and then a sort of at the end of the day you're you're heard from but it's it's too late or it's not timely with regard to what was going on with the prosecution of the accused\n[noise] you know when we look at the movement to pass more seasonal across the country it is a well funded venture that's for sure\nI'm a marsh his brother ... in Munich ... is a billionaire and he spent I think about nearly nine million dollars in Georgia alone what does that say to you about what a lot of people you know the I guess the feelings or emotions behind making sure most of the law gets passed\nMe have Kelsey grammar and sadly and tragically Kelsey grammar is speaking from experience so it's not like they're just using a celebrity but he's speaking from experience that tragic experiences\n[noise] um you know that's a great question and I think what it demonstrates is that people are people who say or their families are victimized by criminal\nUm it is one of the most difficult things to go through it is a difficult both in retrospect and uh you know one of the concerns is or how do we help people move on from that\nAnd what you find is that uh it is difficult to move on if you're a victim of crime and so people that have been in that situation as you said Kelsey grammar speaks very eloquently and the commercial or in the spot that he has\nA he has cut for for martial law and other people that have names are such as the family member or who has has funded this and the interesting thing a rose that I I\nAm very moved by as I was by many victims that came to the court house cues me to the capital or when we were debating this bill and when we were seeking other legislators to support it is um\n[noise] and I remember so many ... ladies wearing the the the the shirts are supporting martial law and one of the things that I said to my colleagues from the well the Senate was the interesting thing about those people that are in the capital of the day\nIs they're not here asking anything from you all they want is sensible legislation so that what they have endured doesn't happen to someone else in Georgia\nSo um I I'm actually very familiar with the Georgia victims bill of rights I spend a lot of time in prosecutors' offices interviewing them and most offices around the state has a copy of the bill of rights hanging in the public area of office lots of individual prosecutors have it\nUm it's very easy if anybody wanted to take a look at it it's very easy to pull it up on line and um Georgia's statutory bill of rights is extensive and it is regarded as one\nThe strongest in the country so when I compare the provisions of the statute to you the provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment I can honestly say the amendment ads nothing that the statue does not already cover and in fact the amendment is smaller in scope than what I see in the statutes\nI Want to get your response than to one of the four major points that proponents of Morsi's last say ... and really has to do with the victim being sort of I guess\nKept up to speed on the on the case on the trial and I asked the senator this I mean I think as a ... if you're a victim or you're the victim's family if you would assume that you're being kept abreast of\nThe alleged perpetrator is out on bill or or what have you that might be baffling to some people's thinking well fish already happened and why do we need to add this to to a statute to a law in order for this\nTo happen it should be up and it says the statute already coverage at the language in the statute says [noise]\nAh the victim has the right to reasonable accurate and timely notice of any actual course game the right to reasonable accurate and timely notice of arrest release or escape of the accused the right not to be excluded from hearings and so forth all of those same provisions like that's all the statute\nAnd then you look at the constitutional language it has all of those same things but within addition in the constitution in order for the constitutional amendment the right in the ... and that meant to be triggered the victim has to request it\nSo the statutory language that you just have the right to be there and get the notice under the constitutional provision you actually have to ask so you have to opt in in order to get that so talked about that in that regard the constitutional phrasing this amendment of phrasing is narrower than what the statute already provides\nSo if there are victims in Georgia who have not received reasonable and timely notice of proceedings who have been kept out where they should have been included\nThat's not a failure of the formal law this statute it's a failure of of of um the way the system happens to be working in that particular jurisdiction and to correct that failure we don't need more formal law we need deeper attention and more resources to making the law we already have effective [noise]\nYou know something else at the center brought up in which was the first one it said look you know just a respect that you as a victim or the victim's family you have a right to be respected now often we may see something like that in a resolution but we're talking about adding that to\n... you know say constitution of respect I mean everybody wants to be respected whether you're a victim of the victim's family adding that language to this um so it's kind of problematic\nUm well we already have that in the statue to uh the last clause of the statute says the victim has the right to be treated fairly and with dignity by all criminal justice agencies so again I don't I don't think the language of the constitutional provision ads\nThat dimension of respect I think that what the senator may have been alluding to is that by placing something in the constitution which has the the um the kind of at an elevated level above statutory schemes in our state\nUm that it's there's a symbolic effect that placing something in the constitution is has more groggy toss than simply placing something in statutes but in terms of the way a victim would experience that\nI'm In ... there in their daily travels through that that case I'm from police to prosecution to court so on um the the constitutional provision will not actually give them any more than a statue does\nAnd you know critics of this lot not just critics or the others were just looking at this from different viewpoints say well look\nYou know let's talk about the what they say the criminal accused or the accused here because in other states they're big concern that Morsi's law could infringe on the rights of the accused I don't see that I\nI don't see it again is looking at this the Georgia statute has been in existence since about Nineteen Ninety six were were more than Twenty years in with the stature\nUm nothing and the statute nothing in the constitutional provision limits anything about the accused experience in the justice system at play allowing the victim a right to be present and the right to be heard does uh only provides the victim of voice and I'm at a an opportunity to meaningfully\nParticipate to the extent that he or she wants to but they're the victim has no ability to veto a plea bargain no ability to block a proposed\n... no ability to um circumvent what would otherwise be the the formal process\nAnd I'm Glad you brought that up because it was leading to my next question because this is more about the victims voice there's nothing in the minute that would force the courts to change a process or add steps in the operations of the process so not really it's just about the voice for the victim or the victim's family ...\n... and it's for victims who wants to opt in so I ... and the the provision says the Georgia general assembly will have to craft some kind of process for victims to opt in\nUm something that would apply across the county is instead of\nUm having a a presumably if with Georgia has a hundred and fifty some odd counties we don't want to see a hundred and fifty different provisions we'd like to have one that has drafted by the general assembly that says hey it for a victim who wants to opt in this is the way to do it but um but the victim doesn't have a right to steer things in any particular\nDirection for some issues have you looked at a martial law and other States I've looked at a very ... M Ms or state that has a version that you think is\nThat works or would maybe be your viewpoint but I mean 'cause there's so many different versions out here there are and\nAnd uh again to the first since ... about the mid nineties ... about thirty states have already had these kinds of provisions in their constitutions um the ones that didn't put it in the constitution had a statutory bill of rights so the landscape is already well traveled in terms of\nOf recognizing the need to give victims of voice in the process [noise]\nUm I think that other states to have been part of the ... the ... um movements over the last couple of years\nHave provisions and their allies that Georgia has chosen not to include which I um and I think the provisions that Georgia has chosen not to include um they have done so wisely because those are the provisions that had triggered problems so for example in North Dakota their version includes a provision we don't have that says\nThe victim has the right to keep confidential any information that might be used to harass or locate her\nAnd that provision in North Dakota has been seized upon by some police officers who allege that they are victims in police officer involved crimes where they it's like a police officer involved shooting and there can be a lot of negative publicity and police officers can be harassed and that\nUse by police officers of that provision is regarded by some people as them hijacking a provision that was not drafted at all for that purpose but Georgia's doesn't include that I think it was very wise that that was left off the table\nWill for maybe ... or anything if you think maybe should have been at it\n[noise] um [noise] I you know I it it's hard for me to say I think in general these laws are\nUm they lack any kind of enforcement mechanism um and there's a reason for that um because constitutional rights in the criminal justice system belong to the defendant the bill of rights both at the federal level and at the state level is meant to be a bulwark against\nOverreaching by the government and it is meant to reflect a counter majority ... sentiment\nSo there's a reason to victim is not a party to the criminal case and that lawmakers have been extremely reluctant to allow the victim\nTo intervene in the case in the way we might see in a civil case there's you know two parties ... there's a civil lawsuit but there's not a party that has of relevance taken it we allow them to intervene we don't allow that here because the constitutional rights belong to the defendant alone because they're just the defendant whose life liberty and property\nIs at stake if the prosecution go south I'm gonna ask\nYou one question I I end up with the senator on and that's it is because when we look at something like this and we look at hate crimes and log Darryl federal protection is obviously put Georgia does not have a hate crime statute so someone let's let me say well what's the difference or why not why don't we have a state hate crime law\n... well I um let me answer when one corollary first which is ... ... is there not a federal victims bill of rights and that sort of constitutional limit\nAnd twice in our history there has been momentum to make that happen in a in Nineteen eighty seven and again in Nineteen Ninety six Ninety seven it was something even that Bill Clinton endorsed at the time but the the momentum never really got anywhere people realized it was\nUm [noise] I ... it was a lot of\nA it was too much symbolism and not enough pay off to put it in the federal bill of rights\nUm but so but getting back to your point about uh on that the hate crime production we have fifty one distinct criminal justice system to the United states ... each state has its own and then there's the federal government\nThe federal criminal justice system is guided by a series of federal criminal statutes and those criminal federal criminal statutes like a federal hate crime statute applies only in federal prosecution prosecution that looks like the United states against\nAgainst Mr X or y [noise] um we cannot use federal statute for local state prosecution\nSo most crime it's happening at the state level and um we need as we need special reasons to make a crime federal that we have to um incorporate a federal interest somehow like if you shoot a federal corrections officer or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "30"}
