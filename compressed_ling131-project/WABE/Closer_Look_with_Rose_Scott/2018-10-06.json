course a up through bank and beyond was intentional ... was supposed to extend into where a lot of this new growth the the west side park and the ... area north up all of a bolt and and all that\nSo you know those are definitely things that we should be talking about\nWho should have been advocating for that side of town where there because I had a gate if it were to melt line would you what you do right now who should have been on that are advocating for the Marta what's not well\nIt's really it's it's it's the city you know because at the end of the day the mayor and the city council or the ones who are supposed to be ... you know listening to citizens looking at all the planning documents thinking about our cities budget and how we move forward in coming forward with a vision\nAnd and ... now we have plenty of plans all over the city for the west side for the south side\nThe problem we have is that we go through all these planning situations and then the next new shiny object comes along we throw all the money at that [laughter] I'm like when the when the bell with Cory park is complete it then all of a sudden there'll be an interest in\nPutting it is that what you're saying anything example anything and just thinking about it I mean the belt line is a great example right you know there was some enthusiasm about it and then you know it's kind of like a while and then we'll just sort of trickle the money at it and then beat him up when they don't do the things they got prominent but\nAll of a you know to your question about you know I'm we're advocating for about one who should be advocating for these other things\nActually don't think that we should have had to advocate for about one and the scenario I think that I mean citizens generally she'll be advocating

working really hard grassroots kind of way to support this vision\nShouldn't really be necessary because the the the project list in my opinion should reflect all the planning that's been done for the last Twenty years and development has been\nAn enormous part of that has had an enormous public engagement larger perhaps than any other project in the city's history and the project list should reflects out and when we realized that it wasn't going to reflect the\nBecause we have that particular interest in the dollar we obviously\nAll mobilized for the ... and you but I certainly wouldn't allow that other ... as well well let's talk about the ... line because they committed suicide when you say you know what we didn't get everything we want but we got something is better than nothing\nYou say you didn't get everything you want what did you I wanted to relate to that that quarter to particularly southeast corner because you've got a little bit of something\nYeah well we want it all seriously I mean we want twenty two miles at transit ... connecting the Marta all over the city as fast as we can get it\nThat was from the original concept Ryan you're you're that's up from the first day I mean what people have lost sight of as the fact that this was a transit plan from day one\nIt was not a park expansion plan and you know other things it was an art it was housing and what was transit oriented in housing in economic development around this twenty two mile loop and how we are the city densely without destroying neighbor connecting all of those and they ...\nAnd not only that it's the transit of the reason that we got this far\nI mean we wouldn't be talking about about one today if it wasn't about trends that and the reason was because in two thousand five we passed the ... district that was based on the transit coming and the communities and south and west Atlanta in particular\nThey thought the park and trail and all that was cute and nice but they really wanted and I remember this vividly because I was living there at the time\nThey want to translate that access into the regional system to get jobs whether it's down to the airport or downtown or perimeter center or whatever else and so the trans as as the thing that connects them into the system and really meaningful way that's really designed for everybody and if we hadn't had it been the case then we would end up\nPass the time which means that project would have been shelved and we'd been collecting dust for the last two years\nThe clipped in court or and obviously that's a\nWhole 'nother discussion but you look at the Clifton court or you look at the downtown street car industry car there's more money allocated for that than it is the Clifton court or the belt line it'd be really clear a lot of the money for the belt line is for the streetcar ... because it's ... with the ... of the five hundred and Seventy million\nMhm you're saying the part of that is more going to the street comes extending the streetcar okay I get to the belt find\nIt hard to I I imagine I won't speak for you but that's a problem for you [noise] well it is you know when when the streetcar never had any ridership that is true in the beginning to now so there's no surprises about what's\nGoing on I have great misgivings about whether making a train that doesn't have any riders longer\nWill get writers me that as it may we spend a hundred million dollars on it but we worry and from the beginning that this would create a problem for transit on the belt line\nBecause people would look at that and go of that so I Want to connect with about was it will connect with the mail and and that's where most of the money's going to is to make those connections with about life and so as a result you're losing\nTheir really wrote bust connections and the planning for density that going that\nGoing around it rather than across it would get you\nNow that's a that's done ... right that's done it yet but I'm just being clear about my my perception of it right too much money for street car you're much attention\nWell you know I think it would be different or it depends on what the design of that is a big challenge for the street cars to get stuck in traffic now doesn't have to be\nWhat all they could my producer Kansas women are our last month we could have been taken out what's up we could've been taken out by the streetcar Candace Wheeler my producer we're over there and it was distraught\nYou mean it almost run you over there are well well there's a\n[laughter] I'm\nI mean maybe then you're thankful it's got stuck in traffic says stuff in time I don't know but you know the but the beauty of the villain is that it's free flowing and when you look at all the traffic congestion on density that will certainly becoming not only to the dollar but also to downtown [noise]\nUm you know we need transit that's free flowing and and the ... and ... if it if it's if it's connected physically to the existing streetcar the belt one is also stuck in traffic which means it's not going to be delivering the\nThis is eight PM you listen to W.

aware of what happened leading up to this point a final confirmation vote is expected soon but it was the question what did the American public learn about the confirmation process and what does this

professor ... have you with me I Am All right there's\nA lot to unpack here but I Want to begin with this ... and and that is where we are now the confirmation process and it's headed to the Senate floor for a full vote any surprises here regarding the procedural votes page\nOr no ... not to me I'm Murkowski apparently voted against it or I'm not sure why she didn't simply just go ahead and vote to take it to the full Senate and then vote against him um it's still possible we may see someone like Senator Collins change that vote to uh no I don't think Jeff Flake is going to based on what we heard\nSo no I didn't think anything was surprising about\nThe Antonio about you surprises yet there for the procedure what was going to be interesting right 'cause you're up for fifty one forty nine or you have um two possible at least one strong no um and then you know you still have Joe which might change his vote as well so that would ship the entire vote to forty nine fifty one against once it goes for the full vote to read it for\nLike not surprise not surprised has given the dynamics and the optics now professor ringing arises\n[noise] no I'm not surprised I Would have been been more surprised had it not proceeded to to a full vote in the Senate I think that was inevitable\nProgress let me stay with you because I Want to get your thoughts and I'll start with you do you believe the FBI the additional investigation and I use that because some people call it an additional ... to really change them senators' minds here at all professor um well I think it's\nHard to know I I think it's certainly gave some senators\nI'm a bit more of a comfort level about going forward it at least gives the\nUm ability to to take away one of I I think the more effective talking points that the Democratic senators used at the hearing\nWhich was why aren't we even having a more objective bodies look at this we're not the right people to be to be trying to parse this out [noise]\nUm so I think in that sense it could have increased people's comfort level um I'm not sure that ultimately at the in the end of the day it will have changed any votes read or what about you I I'm just\nCurious as to the depth of it so with the president being the the side or the arbitrator house full of an investigation the FBI was going to to complete I Do wonder what was in that report\nToo and it seems to have changed some people's minds to to vote to push for it the the nomination so it does seem to have may have made a difference yes\nAgree with a lot of that you know it's interesting that um\nI run a business right and uh when I'm going through the interview process of advice you some red flags you know I I'll look into it to make sure that I'm hiring the right person so [noise] um because it's not very transparent\nThe process is concerned I mean the legislators had to go downstairs into pretty much a bunker to look at the paperwork nothing has been made public we have no way of knowing exactly how deep the investigation when exactly what were they looking into what were they not looking into how many leaves actually existed that they never actually investigated further to find out what the truth really is\n... attorney you you you do an investigation is all the time [laughter] so are we talking about the FBI additional investigation they matter you\nKnow I don't think it mattered a and this is not a traditional FBI investigation and understand it's a background investigation which\nBy its very nature is going to be much more limited than a criminal investigation and that's what really bothered me I think about the expectations people had about what what happened during the course of this supplemental FBI investigation I mean we heard Senator Flake say look\nI've heard Dr Ford I find that she is compelling incredible but there's no corroborating evidence here to support that\nWell the FBI investigation was not going to find corroborating evidence is not designed or set up to do that\nI wrote an opinion piece for CNN dot com basically saying you know Senator Flake if you want to give a judge Kavanaugh this presumption of innocence that's fine but understand that that doesn't normally occur in a sex crime investigation there's not always going to be corroborating evidence especially if you're going to interview only nine people so\nI don't think it changed any minds are I think if anything a professor ring in is corrected may have solidified some votes for Kavanaugh but it didn't change it\nWill let me stay with you and we'll start this question here then do you think that that should be made public or should have been made public prior ethical\nQuestion of what I think should have happened and I know some Democratic senators requested this some of those witnesses should've testified in public before the Senate Judiciary committee specifically mark judge\nI don't think as a general rule and FBI investigation that those interview note should be made public but if it's something this material and the senators wanted to hear from him and presumably he may have wanted to testify or at least would have been required to under subpoena\nI think the public should have heard his live testimony under oath\nProfessor ... ... what do you think [noise] um I agree I I I think making ... FBI background checks public um is not necessarily a path that we want to go down I think that has some presidential value that's not necessarily good\nUm but I fear that what has happened here is that fact\nThe fact that it's not a great idea to make these things public has landed us in the worst of all possible worlds where the public has very little independent ability to evaluate um the information that may or may not be in that background check\nSo um I I think a in in in a better process um and hopefully one of the things that will come out of this is perhaps we can have a better process agreed to many advanced before anyone knows who decides anyone's going to be ...\nBut in a better process you know maybe one thing we could have seen was a bipartisan public release of a summary of the information that both the\nMajority member in the ranking member signed on to something like that that that gave a little more\nUm reliability because now we're just in a world where we we have a you know biased leaks coming out of every every side and tell you what do you think about that investigation\nYeah I mean I think you know the end of the day the sad part about all this is that it goes to the credibility of the court right and if there's one check on all power I'm In the United states as a Supreme Court and we've gotten to a point where we no longer can actually uh you know\nBelieve in what's coming out because of the fact that something is so rushed to the point that uh we don't really look into a all the facts that that could be president in our president\nUm it just takes the credibility away it goes back almost too are you going back in history now you're starting to hear the idea of of a pack into court in the future you know someone else gets to like they were going to increase the number of judges it to me it goes back to almost Nineteen thirty seven you know the switch in time that she has an I\nWear a justice is allowed to take it upon themselves to change the way they were voting because they were seen so political that it was no longer an independent body\n... investigation refineries republic [noise] I agree that it's dangerous\nTo make them public um\nWe don't know it was in it sure so it's kinda hard to to say whether it would have been\nThe swing of swinging issue or not agree with the professor summary would have been nice to have seen and I also agree with Antonio about the politics of it all because you are starting to see a bit of that and can we trust\nOur court and the decisions that are coming out that affect women and children disproportionately perhaps given the the weight in the movement of the court\nIs your thoughts on this because yesterday the wall Street Journal published an op ed by judge Kavanaugh first question is the professor ringing I Do think that that was from your your opinion do you think that was wise to publish his op ed\nIn the midst of all of this it's a fascinating question because one of the things that we see when we look of the history of the Supreme Court confirmation process", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "06"}
