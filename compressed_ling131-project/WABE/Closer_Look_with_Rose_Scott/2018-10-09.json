um with such a high population of black ... folks and black people in general that are disproportionately impacted by the epidemic it's a very serious crisis here in the city of Atlanta\nAnd so Tony ... and we talk about that and then as it relates to look at an already has the issue with affordability has released a housing and then you there's a sub population there as relates to housing for people living with HIV aids it's crucial here in this area\nYes um especially for women who identify 'em with the trans experience um\nIt just like that ... mentioned about ... people in general are also talking about women who are formerly ... folks who are engaging in survival sex work\nUm and trance women who are I'm sixty five percent of uh of folks who identified with the experience are diagnosed with HIV here um\nAnd we've seen this year alone over twenty five\nBy backtrack women had been murdered more recently I'm a ... and in the air\nOut of Chicago I'm always see that with out the necessary resources without mental health um it's hard for folks to survive I'm and there's a rate of um\nBlack transfer men only went into the age of thirty five years old and we asked why cases and they had the cases of homelessness I'm a I'm an over policing in our community is\nDifferent I Want to get some clarity here because I I gave was brief snapshot of the funding for in terms of this is solely dedicated to the housing needs of people with HIV aids and their families is that that's clearly what is dedicated for correct yes any idea how much is distributed to Georgia or the city of Atlanta so\nCurrently this year we have about twenty two twenty three million dollars that's being distributed um I only or state why ... locally so that's just for metro Atlanta that is not statewide so there are too hot for programs there's one from Metra Atlanta and then there's hop a program for rural Georgia and for rural Georgia that\nA hopper program is managed by um the state capital I Can't remember which agency at the state is responsible for managing that but that's managed by state agency metro Atlanta it's managed by the city of Atlanta\nI Want to be clear and make sure we all heard you you said between twenty and twenty two million dollars for the Atlanta region correct on an annual basis this is on an annual basis and who distributes or managers the funds\nThe city of Atlanta which department within the city of Atlanta grants management and the office of human resources\nTo Human Services excuse me\nDuring the show does your organization see these resources\nYes absolutely and many other organizations um who will be celebrating practice leak I'm right I'm are seeking those resources housing I'm HIV services with ... as well as mental health\nDoes your organization use the phones or will use the phones if you get him so I organizations delicious not punishments\nThere is a black translate organization dedicated to empowering I'm black eligibility folks in the city of Atlanta to transform it can't pull 'em so we've been responsible for implementing the pre arrest diversion initiative\nUm we were on your radio station out here about two years ago talking about\nThe most dangerous thing out here to police which was a report that highlighted the experiences of black trans folks and that and the police department\nAre also responsible for marijuana reform making sure that that is only a typical 'em a fan's I'm and I'm collaborating with local organizations like something that's on your ground 'em up around uh Indian cash bail and so we are not\nA hot plus specific um organization or a service organization by our membership base um they receive they're receiving and again these are folks who are fully hostile rated living with HIV sex working out for survival so we all intersect\nDevon you were quoted in that project cue story I'm going to quote you hear the entire grants management process for hospital funding is just a mess\n... what do you have problems [noise]\nWhere do we start well the problem is is that I mean this has been a problem for years so I Want to ground what my what I'm saying and I'm this problem didn't start with this administration this problem has goes back three or four ministry mayor seem reads administration even further than that\nI'm Franklin Franklin a\nMayor Campbell I mean this awkward program is not a new program and the city has been administering this program for quite some time um and if you talk to hop with providers throughout the city they will constantly tell you about the late payments that's the number one issue so when the city or a knows that they're submitting that money to the federal government\nI'm just like uh we get grants from the federal government for roads and highways and all those things of that nature we don't wait for the federal government actually cut a check before we start to work however\nWith ... we're waiting for the federal government to cut that check before the city of Atlanta starts disseminating those funds we don't do that for any other type of programming we don't do that for roads\nBridges and highway let's be clear is do we know if the city of Atlanta has received this year's or this fiscal years disbursement money\nUm what I can tell you is that the hopper providers have not been paid as of yet I'm for this year and that money has already been allocated by the federal got so\nThey're so you're saying there is between twenty and twenty two million dollars at the city of Atlanta has for this program ... and nobody's received anything no one has received any money for the heck are in control of the city you an advocate for a lot of the agencies Tony shove you are reached out to the city and asked them quite frankly what's up\nYet and they are aware of what is going on the grants management office in the office of Human Services are aware of what's going on a matter of fact I'm this effort has started um I actually really earlier this summer and where we really realized that there was a huge issue\nUm and so one of the the outcomes of that advocacy was actually the removal of the previous grant management director Jean couch Bob I'm because we ... the city saw um based on what we present it that there was a story of mismanagement and Jean wasn't working fast enough\nTo address those issues and they still are unaddressed when\nWas just individual remove within within the last year a couple of years old was in the last two months too much yeah any idea told him he said they said anything about okay we're working to get someone to manage this well they've already put someone else in places\nThat have yes and of course I'm for community members the folks who are direct impact it directly impacted and experiencing a homeless at right now it's politics that's what it feels like instead of what they're saying to us is that um to simply wait and again we can't wait wait on what if they put somebody\nIn the position so what part of it is getting the contracts a revised um and there was just even mistakes this year so for example when folks were acts of what the previous year so when folks were asked to give agencies were asked to give what what their\nMeat was going to be out of that twenty three million dollar pot of money what they needed as far as their hopper programs to either provide more services or keep surfaces just baseline instead of\nSaying that the money that you will be requested what happened for a carry your four year they told folks after the fact after they put submitted for a year that actually you have to make that money stretch for two years\nSo has it so it sounds like the funding criteria or even with an application process has also changed correct\nAnd that's changes were not notified to the hopper providers so they made changes in the middle of the process\nUm and in addition what is also um fueling this issue and it's really of concerns while we're making this mistakes here on the local level\nFederally there was changes to the federal formula Larry um and so that formula Larry now means that the city of Atlanta is going to see her a nine million dollar reduction over the next four years\nOf ... of of the amount of funding that's available for hopper providers here in the city\nAnd we say changes changes in terms of what criteria for the agencies to meet or just that there's just\nNo lashing the budget they're slashing the budget and it was the result of what was considered a bipartisan\nAgreement and Congress because rural communities were saying that we are now experiencing the bulk of the epidemic the epidemic we're not seeing the same amount of new cases in New York and San Francisco and cities that had traditionally led the epidemic and so because of that\nThey wanted to see more equity as it pertains to rural communities being able to\nGive them which is a fair a very valid claim correct money's being taken on yesterday just taken away but given to another population is so desperately needs right\nBut what happens if you are a city like Atlanta that is also within a rural community right but there's also a an urban epicenter as well wiser now\nHas disproportionate I mean you look at the numbers to I mean it's it's the disparity there is great right Tony when you hear people listening here in this delay can you\nPaint a human interest stories worse in terms of what this means for someone and maybe their family who was waiting on these on these services on the funds for these services\nYeah I'm thank you so much for asking that question um it it is simply that um you have people I hear women in particular who um who simply to sneak housing um who um\nWho literally are living in a hotel room um and are needed support my organization like our as like organizations like on the rise I'm In pre arrest diversion\nUm to provide stipends or um vouchers for um temporary living can I'm living arrangements\nWas that um there was an election coming up that it would politicized the court to have a confirmation hearing 'em in the lead up to a presidential election and then most significantly a speaker McDonald a or McConnell\nUm said that the the people should have a say um and that because the presidential election\nWas pending um the seats should remain vacant until the people had their say through the presidential election about who they wanted to uh fill the seat\nAnd there was there was a lot of back and forth about whether that was an unprecedented move 'em and\n... there there are different ways to cut that history but it it left us in a place of course where President Obama was unable to fill that need it sat vacant for a year and was ultimately filled by Neil Gorsuch has you know\n[noise] now judge Kavanaugh before he was confirmed we talked about this last week he had an op ed published in the wall Street Journal and he described his views of the role of the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm going to quote something that he says series that the Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an ... that you're not conscious in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed to the court I Will be part of a team of nine\nCommitted to the signing cases according to the constitution and laws of the United states I Would always strive to be a team player we hear that but as you know in ... and all this conversation about this being a win win for President Trump evangelicals\nAre there are certain demographic voter groups that see this as a win for them regardless of what now judge Kevin justice Kavanaugh has said an op ed they see this as someone\nCalled on their side of all we can get another hour talking about all the issues that might come up\nTo ... of course it matters who sits in those seats right I mean if it didn't matter than Merrick Garland would be sitting there um everyone knows that it matters I think the really important distinction to draw here um and I thank you for your question and the opportunity to talk about this\nThe really important distinction is whether the court is per se is political or partisan\nSo let me explain what I mean by that um the court is almost always political in the following way um it's obviously deeply involved in decisions that have political salient that matter to people in terms of ordinary politics\nThat um play two different people's political preferences\nIt's also political in the sense that\nEasy cases don't get to the U.S Supreme Court by the time a case gets to the U.S Supreme Court what that almost certainly means is that there are very good very credible arguments on both sides of the issue\nIn different justices have different um different ideas\nAbout when that happens what wins what what strands of our constitutional reasoning should um take precedence in those very close cases\nSo it's political in that sense in that constitutional law isn't math justices are going to have to make some choices that are going to um differ even among justices acting in good faith\nThat's all very different than saying that the court is ...\nI'm a partisan court is a court that actually decides um or or or ... is perceived to decide the same case differently depending on who the parties in front of it are\nUm the quintessential I I'm an illustration of a court that um was arguably are accused of acting in a partisan way which of course ... Bush Gore when the justices took positions that seemed contrary to the normal ways that they looked at equal protection claims the underlying claims there\nAnd and many people thought the justices never would've taken aside they did if the parties had been reversed\nThat's what it means to be partisan and that's a much more dangerous thing than being political\nLet me ask you is professor do you think doing when we have the confirmation hearings do you think that justices are the nominees should be asked about his her own personal belief as it relates to let's say rural V. way or the death penalty should those questions be asked should the American public know\nHow a justice stands on that or should those questions solely be related to as a relief to the constitution\nWell there's ... that the reason those questions get asked\nThat way is because nominees we'll frequently say that it's inappropriate\nFor them to answer how they would rule on a likely case um so the senators tried to kind of work the way around that by saying I'm not asking how you would rule I'm just asking what you personally believe [noise] um I think I think\nBoth I think that's the wrong way into a ... a real issue that the senator should ask about and that the nominees should answer I'm In what they what they say is a nominee should be able to\nUm answer what other judges sitting on the court justices sitting on the court had said and when when when the case comes up about like wrote to use your example\nI think it's perfectly appropriate for a nominee to talk us through what she thinks the stronger in weakest arguments in that case which justices opinion do you think is the most persuasive and why\nUm I think that's fair game um because that's the way that we kind of have impact on constitutional meaning over time um and of course the cat he had his facts matter um any lawyer any first year law student will tell you the facts of the case matter every case genuinely is different\nI'm so justices arc or nominees aren't giving anything away by saying here's what I like and dislike about the reasoning in these cases but I'm Still not going to commit to how I'm going to rule in some hypothetical case that may or may not come before me\nAnd has a right now a professor as we wrap up how would you describe the political leanings or whether or not we're supposed to know the bias wrong buys makeup of the court which where does it ... I think it's pretty obvious but I'm interested in what you have to say\nI I I think all of the political science data indicates that we will have one of the most conservative court that we've had in ... in decades um and that's part of why this was so important and such a tense contest\nUm the the chance to solidify a solidly conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nThe last time that we were in that position was during the ... nomination I'm In we all know how that went so I think there was there there was a real I'm a insistence that it not be allowed to slip away this time and that's part of what made this so so difficult\nProfessor I imagine every ... law student they have to take a class new correct 'cause I'm ready to take a class [laughter]\nWell You're welcome anytime learn so much Laurie ring hand is professor of law at the University of Georgia she joined me from the WG a studio in Athens is while they were always we appreciate frittering it thank you so much for adding more insight into this very complex and interesting and unprecedented\nConfirmation process like you so much pleasure thank you [noise]\n\n[noise] we know you have lots of choices when it comes to the news but you believe everything you read or hear\nProbably not and that's where Ninety point one comes in because you listen why not give with your early donation to W.

downtown Atlanta to allow that development to happen given examples well or do you think that um folks would wanting to be in in investing in the Gulch if\nFive points rail station wasn't it didn't happen to be right next to it um underground Atlanta the the the development that's happening between\nA five points in God that station that area is transforming Georgia State is clearly part of that but transportation is clearly a piece of that\nAnd transit is a is really robust and that you know piece of the city\nYou don't think that there will be development still taking place if there was it was some connection to a martyr transit station you know things to develop instilled have ...\nI don't think it would be as robust and I don't think it would be happening as quickly as we see it happening you know I always think about uh as I fly into the city\nSo much of our development is just right along the court orders of our transit system in in in downtown and midtown Atlanta now the wrote the road system is there as well and that's a big piece of it as well but development happens around transportation\nLet me ask you is then given that we're going to dig into this year or more in Atlanta given what you just sit there and look at the west side there's no plans for heavy rail and there's development popping up all on the west side been talking about this on the last thirty days so why no real expansion for the west side you know we have\nTo really come up with a\nConstrained program lesson and there is you know we are investing in the west side with this more Marta program and we can get into that you know we have there'd be Archie quarter there that we're investing in as well as a camel to an wrote on the west side so significant investment on the west side\nBut when you think of cameras in road and then you think you're right it's on the west side but they're the other west side there's there's a lot of\nDevelopment happening and if you can't get people out there that want to that need jobs or you know if the developers urban creek partners' partners yeah a lot of development taken place and you don't\nHave a way for people to get people want to take the train cars yeah folks don't want to get on a bus sometimes it'll be really clear Mr ... you don't have real going out you know you have plans for him to go out there and you and I both know that the west side is gonna be it's going to explode already exploding\nIt is and we need to find ways this this region and the city needs to find ways to invest in the west side and and all over metro Atlanta to allow that development tap\nSo you need input from the city of Atlanta to help\nNo I you know I think we've got substantial and point input from the city of Atlanta about where to make these investments with this program\nWhat I'm saying is that you know we started with a program list that was eleven billion dollars you and I could sit down and quickly increase at eleven billion dollars and you just fired off some of them we could probably come up with twenty thirty billion dollars worth of investment\nAnd when did you just tell me before we came over on the air you said that he the out he had over ... billion dollars\nForty billion dollar investment ... in ... in transit yeah not transportation just just transit or Los Angeles hundreds of billions of dollars investment in transit so you know we we've got to work with what we have and that's what we're focused on today in terms of\nAdvancing a transfer program but you know going back to what you asked me at the beginning this can't be considered the only by the apple we're not going to continue to grow as a city and a region if we're not investing in infrastructure\nThe way that feeds the way we need to feed that growth mind\nWhat you could do if you had forty billion absolutely you know the original project less it was criticized because especially for those who were advocating for trans on them and in the end it did make it onto the project lists\nYou all know that the important of having transit along the mountain and how do you see that being crucial for this overall the overall future of Marta had any transit now advocates wanted transit all around the twenty two mile loop how do you see the lawn fit in well\nYou know let me back up and say you talked about that the project list was criticized we started with an eleven billion dollar list and have you do now to to point seven billion dollars worth of expected revenue so of course we weren't going to make everybody everybody happy and we took a ... you know we took a lot of time\nIn outreach I think it was from artist perspective was pretty historic ... was\nIt was reaching out at board meetings and talking to people it was working with city council it was all sorts of outreach that got us to that proposal list\nAnd then we did additional out outreach over the past two or three months to really make sure that we were in alignment with what the voters and what the people in the city thought was important and I think we did a great job with that now\nIt didn't mean that we ... we have the ability to fund the entire belt line and I think there's some you know there's some real a technical challenges with the belt line that\nAs far as Marta will need to deliver these projects the you know for example um there's a real desire to fund that South east quadrant of melt line\nWell the next\nQuarter mile half mile mile is a tunnel and nobody has gone through any environmental process today\nThere's there there are some some concepts of what could be done with a tunnel some concepts of what could be done by accessing stations are in park king memorial and bypassing\nPieces of ah you know of that tunnel and so we've got real technical challenges that we need to figure out that we're at a concept level\nAnd that's you know what we're focusing on right now is trying to figure out what the best next step up the outline can be so that we can maximize that investment\nSo he said trying to figure out how do you do that\nWell the way we're going to do it is to look forward and talk to a were put together a process to find if there are public private\nTheir ships and it goes back to the original concept to the belt line if if you if you go you know way back into time machine when we were talking about the belt line before we had this funding source the belt line was going to be built\nBy leveraging the property values along the the ... so that's you know that's what we want to do we want to look at opportunities to work with developers and maybe find opportunities to have\nPieces of a station built by a developer that would lower the cost and and really we need to maximize that investment I Believe in the Marta board believes\nThat the belt line is a great project all twenty two miles as well as such streetcar network with us from it and I believe that the belt line a B I laid out as in the city council approved as the belt lined street car plant\nLet's talk about the streetcar sure and you all agree to take over operation of the ... ...\nHow do you see first of all getting the public to\nGet on board so to speak with the with the streetcar you have to expand it because it's a very short route as right now and you know complaints about all of the street car got stuck or the streetcar hit my car all that you know ... how do you see the expansion of the street car and and and and lay out for our listeners who may not know what\nThat looks like yeah so so what is recommended and what we're moving forward with is an ex stench of the streetcar both east and west so east over the crowd market\nAnd then west by the Georgia world Congress center a major note of you know of demand for\nFor people who visit and live in the city\nAnd then continuing on over through the ... center where there are thousands of students and then eventually you know connecting to the belt line so we would have a court or an east west court or that connects one side of the belt line through the ... center\nGeorgia world Congress through the existing streetcar system that we have today and then over the crowd market and I think the importance of this is is that if you think about particularly in mid town in downtown some of the most\nDifficult travel is east west so we need to work with the city to come up with ways to prioritize\nYou know travel time on the street car and make sure that it gets priority over over automobiles and we're going to work through these issues and make it more\nPublic engagement is not an easy process and it's trying to touch as many people as you can\nMaking sure that you're listening well to them and we will continue that and and very quickly we will move from public engagement about what the program is to public engagement about every project\nAnd that's where you know there's going to be a lot of conversations around where stop should be how things are going to operate and\nAnd clearly both the federal government requires it but it's also just the right thing to do when you're spending public dollars to engage the public and we will and will continue to do it and um you know it's it's great to interact with the public and understand what meet their needs [noise]\nJeffrey Parker is Marta CEO and general manager as always thank you
