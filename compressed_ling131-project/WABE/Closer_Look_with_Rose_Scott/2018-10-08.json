it's crucial here in this area\nYes um especially for women who identify 'em with the trans experience um it just like that and mentioned about ... people in general are also talking about women who are formerly incarcerated folks were engaging and survival sex work\nUm and trance women who are I'm sixty five percent of uh of folks who identified with the chance experience are diagnosed with HIV here um and we've seen this year alone over twenty five\nBy chance women have been murdered more recently I'm a ... and in Sierra out of Chicago I'm always see that with out the necessary resources without mental health um it's hard for folks to survive I'm and there's a rate of um\nBlack transformation only went into the age of thirty five years old and we asked why cases and they had the cases of homelessness I'm a I'm an over policing in our community\nIs different I Want to get some clarity here because I I gave was brief snapshot of the funding for in terms of this is solely dedicated to the housing needs of people with HIV aids and their families or that next clearly what is dedicated for correct yes any idea how much is distributed to Georgia or the city of Atlanta\nSo currently this year we have about twenty two twenty three million dollars um that's being distributed um Herald leader state why\n... locally so that just for metro Atlanta that is not statewide so there are too hot for programs there's one from Metra Atlanta and then there's hop a program for rural Georgia and for rural Georgia that\nA hopper program is managed by um the state capital I Can't remember which agency at the state is responsible for managing that but that's managed by state agency metro Atlanta is managed by the city of Atlanta\nI Want to be clear and make sure we all heard you you said between twenty and twenty two million dollars for the Atlanta region correct on an annual basis to this is on an annual basis and who distributes or managers the funds the city of Atlanta which department within the city of Atlanta grants\nManagement and the office of human resources\nTo Human Services excuse me\nDuring the show does your organization see these resources\nYes absolutely and many other organizations um who will be celebrating practice leak I'm right I'm are seeking those resources housing I'm HIV services with ... as well as mental health\nHow does your organization use the phones or will use the phones if you get him\nOur organization solutions not punishment collaborative as a black translate organization dedicated to\nHiring um black algae Beatty folks in the city of Atlanta to transform it can't pull 'em so we've been responsible for implementing the pre arrest diversion initiative\nUm we were on your radio station out here about two years ago talking about\nThe most dangerous thing out of here at the police which was a report that highlight at\nThe experiences of black trans folks are and that land a police department\nAre also responsible for marijuana reform making sure that that is only a typical I'm a fence I'm and I'm collaborating with local organizations like something that's on your crown um up around um inning cash bail and so um we are not\nA hapless specific um organization or a service organization by our membership base um they received they received and again these are folks who are from the hospital rated living with age had the sex working out for survival so we all intersect\nDevon you were quoted in that project cute story on the court you hear the entire grants management process for hospital funding is just a mess close quote what you have problems [noise]\nWhere do we start well the problem is is that I mean this has been a problem for years so I Want to ground what ... what I'm saying and I'm this problem didn't start with this administration this problem has goes back three or four minister ration mayor seem reads administration even further than that\nUm and Franklin Franklin a\nMayor Campbell I mean this ... program is not a new program in the city has been administering this program for quite some time um and if you talk to hop or providers throughout the city they will constantly tell you about the late payments that's the number one issue\nSo when the city or a knows that they're submitting that money to the federal government I'm just like uh we get grants from the federal government for roads and highways and all those things of that nature we don't wait for the federal government actually cut a check before we start to work\nHowever would hop while we're waiting for the federal government to cut that check before the city of Atlanta starts disseminating those funds we don't do that for any other type of programming we don't do that for roads bridges and highway let's\nBe clear knew we know if the city of Atlanta has received this year's or this fiscal years disbursement ...\nUm what I can tell you is that the hopper providers have not been paid as of yet I'm for this year and that money has already been allocated by the federal got so\nThey're so you're saying there is between twenty and twenty two million dollars at the city of Atlanta has for this program ... and nobody's received anything no one has received any money for the heck are in control of the city you an advocate for a lot of the agencies Tony shove you are reached out to the city and asked them quite frankly what's up\nYet and they are aware of what is going on the grants management office in the office of Human Services are aware of what's going on a matter of fact I'm this effort has started um I actually really earlier this summer and where we really realized that there was a huge issue\nUm and so one of the the outcomes of that advocacy was actually the removal of the previous grant management director Jean couch Bob I'm because we ... the city saw um based on what we present it that there was a story of mismanagement and Jean wasn't working fast enough\nTo address those issues and they still are unaddressed\nWhen was this individual remove within within the last year a couple of years old within the last two months too much yeah any idea told me said they said anything about okay we're working to get someone to manage this well they've already put someone else in places\nThat have yet and of course I'm for community members the folks who are direct impact it directly impacted and experiencing a homeless at right now it's politics that's what it feels like instead of what they're saying to us is that um to simply wait and again we can't wait wait on what if they put somebody in the position so\nWhat part of it is getting the contracts a revised um and there was just even mistakes this year so for example when folks were acts of what the previous year so when folks were asked to give agencies were asked to give what what their\nMeat was going to be out of that twenty three million dollar pot of money what they needed as far as ah their hopper programs to either provide more services or keep surfaces just baseline instead of saying that the money that you will be requesting what happened for\nA carry your four year they told folks after the fact after they put submitted for a year that actually you have to make that money stretch for two years so has it so it sounds like the funding criteria or even with an application process has also changed correct\nAnd that's changes were not notified to the hopper providers so they made changes in the middle of the process\nUm and in addition what is also um fueling this issue and it's really of concerns while we're making this mistakes here on the local level federally\nThere was changes to the federal formula Larry um and so that formula Larry now means that the city of Atlanta is going to see or a nine million dollar reduction over the next four years\nOf ... of of the amount of funding that's available for hopper providers here in the city\nAnd we say changes changes in terms of what criteria for the agencies to meet or just that there is\nNo it'll last year in the budget they're slashing the budget and it was the result of what was considered a bipartisan agreement in Congress\nBecause rural communities were saying that we are now experiencing the bulk of the epidemic the epidemic we're not seeing the same amount of new cases in New York and San Francisco and cities that had traditionally led the epidemic and so because of that they wanted to see more equity as it pertains to rural communities being able to\nGet in trouble which is a fair a very valid claim correct money's being taken on yesterday just taken away but given to another population is so desperately needs right\nBut what happens if you are a city like Atlanta that is also within a rural community right but there's also a an urban epicenter as well wiser\nNow has disproportionate I mean you look at the numbers to I mean it's it's the disparity there is great right Tony when you hear in people listening here in this delay can you\nPaint a human interest story for us the terms of what this means for someone and maybe their family who was waiting on these on these services on the funds for these services\nYeah I'm thank you so much for asking that question um it it's simply that um you have people I hear women in particular who um who simply just need a housing\nUm who um who\nLiterally are living in hotel rooms um and are needed support by organization like our as like organizations like on the rise 'em and pre arrest diversion um to provide stipends or um vouchers for um temporary living can I'm\nSo so that it it is unusual but it it also has an asterisk next to it why it happened the way it happened\nLet's start with that for our listeners because the Senate changed the rules to move the Gorsuch Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination many folks are saying well how did this happen can you take us through how that exactly happened and what was this changes rule change well I I'm ... there there's a couple of things that\nWere relevant to that and that there is disagreement about whether it was a change in practice or not\nWe could add that to the list of things that we disagree about last I saw that the head [laughter] right of course the Justice Scalia or the late Justice Scalia a conservative justice um died or in January before the election in January of twenty sixteen\nUm and the Senate Republicans announced that they would not take to the floor they would not hold hearings on any nominee named at that point for that vacancy by President Obama um and the justification for that the articulated reason\nWas that um there was an election coming up that it would politicized the court to have a confirmation hearing 'em in the lead up to a presidential election and then most significantly a speaker McDonald a or McConnell\nUm said that the the people should have a say um and that because the presidential election was pending um the seats should remain vacant until the people had their say through the presidential election about who they wanted to uh fill the seat\nAnd there was there's a lot of back and forth about whether that was an unprecedented move 'em and\n... there there are different ways to cut that history but it it left us in a place of course where President Obama was unable to fill that need it sat vacant for a year and was ultimately filled by Neil Gorsuch has you know\n[noise] no judge Kavanaugh before he was confirmed we talked about this last week he had an op ed published in the wall Street Journal yeah and he described his views of the role of the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm going to quote something that he says series that the Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an ... that you're not conscious in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed to the court I Will be part of a team of nine\nCommitted to the signing cases according to the constitution and laws of the United states\nI Would always strive to be a team player we hear that but as you know in ... in all of this conversation about this being a win win for President Trump evangelicals\nAre there are certain demographic voter groups that see this as a win for them regardless of what now judge Kevin justice Kavanaugh has said an op ed they see this as someone\nQuote on their side of all we can get another hour talking about all the issues that might come up\nTo ... of course it matters who sits in those seats right I mean if it didn't matter than Merrick Garland would be sitting there um everyone knows that it matters I think the really important distinction to draw here um and I thank you for your question and the opportunity to talk about this the really important distinction is whether the\nCourt is per se is political or partisan\nSo let me explain what I mean by that um the court is almost always political in the following way um it's obviously deeply involved in decisions that have political salient that matter to people in terms of ordinary politics\nThat um play two different people's political preferences\nIt's also political in the sense that\nEasy cases don't get to the U.S Supreme Court by the time a case gets to the U.S Supreme Court what that almost certainly means is that there are very good very credible arguments on both sides of the issue\nIn different justices have different um different ideas about when that happens what wins what what strands of our constitutional reasoning should\nUm take precedence in those very close cases so it's political in that sense in that constitutional law isn't math justices are going to have to make some choices that are going to um differ even among justices acting in good faith\nThat's all very different than saying that the court is ...\nI'm a partisan court is a court that actually decides um or or or ... is perceived to decide the same case differently depending on who the parties in front of it are um the quintessential I I'm an illustration of a court that um was\nArguably are accused of acting in a partisan way which of course ... Bush Gore when the justices took positions that seemed contrary to the normal ways that they looked at equal protection claims the underlying claims there and and many people thought the justices never would have taken the side they did if the parties had been reversed\nThat's what it means to be partisan and that's a much more dangerous thing than being political\nIssues professor do you think during when we have the confirmation hearings do you think that justices are the nominees should be asked about his her own personal belief as it relates to let's say rural V. way or the death penalty should those questions be asked should the American public know\nHow a justice stands on it or should those questions solely related to as a relief to the\nConstitution well there's ... that that the reason those questions get asked that way\nIs because nominees we'll frequently say that it's inappropriate for them to answer how they would rule on a likely case um so the senators to try to kind of work the way around that by saying I'm not asking how you would rule I'm just asking what you personally believe [noise] um I think I think it's\nBoth I I think that's the wrong way into a ... a real issue that the senator should ask about and that the nomination answer I'm In what they what they should say is a nominee should be able to\nUm answer what other judges sitting on the court justices sitting on the court has said and when when when the case comes up about like wrote to use your example I think it's perfectly appropriate for a nominee to talk us through what she thinks the stronger in weakest arguments in that case\nWhich justices or opinion do you think is the most persuasive and why\nUm I think that's fair game um because that's\nThe way that we kind of have\nImpact on constitutional meaning over time um and of course the cat is facts matter um any lawyer any first year law student will tell you the facts of the case matter every case genuinely is different\nI'm so justice is argue or nominees aren't giving anything away by saying here's what I like and dislike about the reasoning in these cases but I'm Still not going to commit to how I'm going to rule in some hypothetical case that may or may not come before me\nAnd as of right now professor as we wrap up how would you describe the political leanings or whether or not we're supposed to know the bias on buys makeup of the court which where there's a link and I think it's pretty obvious but I'm interested in what you have to say\nI I I think all of the political science data indicates that we will have one of the most conservative court that we've had in ... in decades um and that's part of why this was so important and such a tense contest\nUm the the chance to solidify a solidly conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nThe last time that we were in that position was during the ... nomination um and we all know how that went so I think there was there there was a real I'm a insistence that it not be allowed to slip away this time and that's part of what made this so so difficult\nProfessor I imagine every UGA law student they have to take a class when you correct 'cause I'm ready to take a class [laughter]\nWell You're welcome anytime learned so much Laurie ring hand is professor of law at the University of Georgia she joined me from the W.
