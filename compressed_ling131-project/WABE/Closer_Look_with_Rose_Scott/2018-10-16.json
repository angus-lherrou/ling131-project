this upcoming intimate elections to ensure that when you go to the polls at least the Fulton County\nThat it should be a a seamless process for someone what do you ever been doing\nWell ... as far as the procedures go that have been in place for years those are still in place there are lots of checks and balances that that are in place before machines go out we test all of them we do the logic inaccuracy testing once they are sent to the polls\nThey are sealed and those seal numbers are recorded voters or the poll workers verify those when they open them up they verify that there are no votes on the machines on the first day or on election day that morning\nAnd that process during early voting goes on every day and evening where they are sealed re sealed the seals are broken they verify everything to make sure it's balanced all through early voting\nLet's talk about those poll workers they are they got their training process correct correct if you ever find yourself in need of more poll workers had been an issue for you all\nDuring early voting we use a temporary staffing agency so ... that we're we're fine in that regard on election day we have\nUm what do you train them

county so we we definitely need\nTo have more flexible hours here we say more flexible hours you may be expanding ours are well we're we're open eight thirty seven Monday through Saturday noon to five on both Sunday and then the last week were open seven to seven the whole week and\nYou think that's enough to like more time would you like to shorten it\nWhile we could ... the ... the state doesn't restrict us in that I mean we could stay open later if we wanted I think my staff might kill me if I if I did that but yeah I think eight thirty seven is fine for the first couple of weeks\nDuring the

know about what it means now to wake up and be a millionaire [noise]\nThey don't know certain life skills and said you have to say if you're going to be a coach\nAnd he said red Auerbach told them that if you're going to be ... you have to be willing to be a father figure sometimes\nAbsolutely I worked with Kenny uh Turner off you know and he literally understood and could connect to these players and it's important you know I Want ...\nPlaying for the hawks to mean something in the NBA community and not for what you earn but for what you do and being connected to a community I'm a native land and in my motivation for being here was community what I\nYou know have been very very fortunate that I've been able to work in a fairly significant jobs with really nice companies in Atlanta\nBut sports can galvanize the community sports can bring a community together better than any politician or policy so when you do it right which we haven't quite gotten there yet but we're making strides you you're a community asset and you touch people's lives and the most positive way\nAnd speaking of a positive way you all have a pretty fancy renovated arena that's pretty positive now the state farm arena how'd you Ninety two million dollar transformation in\nWhat is this high definition video that you all say will enhance the endgame experience so wedded to my flat screen oh oh yeah that killed your [laughter] I um\nI just came from the arena to come here and whoa\nWe live in a world of screens yes you know we grew up looking at a TV screen and it was static and it didn't have anything but three or four channels and then it became the explosion of cable\nAnd so when the architects came to us they brought us this very unusual idea that we wouldn't have a center hunger scoreboard that we'd have for video pavilions one in each corner so people could look to the writer they're left and have a great deal\nAnd we said that's really interesting we need to think about it 'cause when you do something that's so non traditional you're taking a risk and in the middle of the night it was obvious\nOne of the reasons we had to renovate are building 'cause there was a risk we had all the premium on one side in a city that the best part of it as inclusion and diversity we had a division you can't come over here you don't have a ticket and so we said\nLet's do this let's keep the for video pavilions and let's add and incredible scoreboard in the middle and that's what we did\nSo we have more video screens square footage pixels which a lot of people don't understand I Can't tell you I'm One of them who do than any other building in the NBA\nAnd so you're telling me Steve couldn't riding on a closer look that regardless of the the ... that the price of your ticket when you come into this new State Farm arena you will get an experience just maybe you won't get anywhere else in the in the NBA because you have all these screens and make it absolutely right there on the court\nIs the first of all we have seven rose off the upper deck to make that a better experience we built a new upper deck the chick fillet fans on\nThat um I think is one of the highlights of the building and and we wanted to celebrate Atlanta when we did this building so we are where the first NBA arena ... probably the first sports arena\nThat we got with killer Mike and we built a sweatshop we have a barber shop swag shave wash and groom overlooking the court for terrorists can get your hair cut and watch the game\nI get a fate and watch the gap silly but it's an ... to Atlanta the\nBarber shop poachers a huge part of it on my first job as a kid was delivering Barbara beauty supplies as a twelve year old with a guy who had a business every Saturday I'd go run around with them and put the stuff in the boxes and there was all going downtown and to to urban areas and the barber shop\nI learned also at Turner and the beauty salons when we marketed a TBS Tyler Perry show how influential on how important that piece was so we wanted something in the arena that symbolized\nAbout big piece of land and we also wanted to celebrate the music component with killer Mike and then we built a twenty thousand square foot unbelievable restaurant bar with Atlanta Zach Brown that will be in our concert north ends\nOn with all these with this upgrade and let's clear this because you know they're always rumors\nWithout the upgrade was this franchise looking to relocate at all you know you guys are just city in America we want to not only that large list\nThe brains went up the street so that they didn't leave Atlanta Miami depending on you and technically they did yeah would we um you know I mean it just never was on because you see this connection with Atlanta Atlanta is one of the great\nNBA markets my job to make it a great Elana hawks margin every morning when I Would get ratings from NBA on TNT I don't know it's a top five marketing income grew in how do we love\nThe NBA but not all of our home team in part of it that's nobody's from here [laughter] that's part of it is they weren't part of the community for the last fifty years and part of it was that people didn't have faith and ownership that proved themselves out is not worth ... being trustworthy and those days are changing\nOnly professional team as you know goes beyond what you present on the field um and you know that the leagues have had to adjust because listen than habits change so if you could what would you change anything about the NBA that you think\nAs a league that they need to adjust to this relates to the fan habit\nFounded the building we just built into the next generation building the idea of coming and going to ... feet having you know a hotdog served to you and the looming in foil wrapper with I watered down beer or soft drink something happened today and so\nThe NBA I made a big big social media investment different than other sports and we let you can basically watch a game on Twitter mhm you really can\nAnd we let that happen because we grew the base we grew the fans rather than holding on to all the media because we wanted to make a dime and so I think the NBA has done a lot of things that said I Would be shocked in ten years if baseball there and have shorter games and if we didn't have shorter games\nPeriod in eighty two season\nNow for set a forty eight minutes maybe forty really I wouldn't be surprised ... forty minutes\nIn your fans of say well listen I'm I'm paying top dollar I hate the guys I and you know even though I didn't see elsewhere now let's see but it's not like for ten minutes then\nAgain I'm hypothesized [laughter] and I will tell you in forty minutes he's still sweat [laughter] actually the SARS could play more\nYeah speaking of fan habits four years ago when you were brought into this role it was a terrible time for them ... lessons really be clear and then maybe deservedly so\nWith the\nAnytime race or racism is brought into any environment any space\nWhat was your approach and trying to maneuver through all of that because it was ...\nWell I was here six weeks if I had no history if I would've known for the state of Turner and been really apple of course [laughter] and you know at its core\nWas some out of touch people trying to hurt each other at its core that really believed and didn't understand that land and that's the big piece here if you understand this city nobody scares any body nobody keeps anybody at its best when we're altogether\nForty six percent of our ticket buyers for the Atlanta Hawks are African American ... the number two team in the league is the Washington Wizards at nine percent\nSo that's the different that's a different wow so you celebrate who we are\nYou promote who we are and you create inclusion and comfort and\nYou you do everything you can to embrace communities\nAnd that's what we've done we've invested in communities we've connected one of the first things I did was um three of our top seven executives are African American women with Keith title which didn't exist in doesn't exist in sports\n\nAre you dance and six seven eight five five

I Love all the programs that were able to bring to the community\nI Love this program this best program ever in history right well of course it is I'm curious about some things that you learn from local kids when you brought them back to talk about the best things that happened to them and twenty Seventeen that special what you need you last the longest holiday were honest and that's why they ... at the end and I'm not\nThat the other guys who'd been on this program aren't honest but when we decided to do the kids' show and I said to my producers and sometimes I think when I just caught up in Canada will tell you my producer off the top of my head I'll say something let's do a show with kids and it's like really real\nThey get it you know I I it was a year where there was so much tension in our nation filled with discrimination and racism sexism I just wanted to talk to kids to say hey your school year\nAnd we had a young man on Jerry who had had multiple heart surgeries who was finally going to be able to go back to school and being on a regular classroom talked to him talk to Diego said nah schools okay but it's like a straight a student you know um I Love talking to kids because I think often we don't listen to them enough\nAnd that's right and we don't we stop\nWe think that the information and the education should go one way but if we allow it to flow back to us it just opens up our world and our possibility\nAnd that's what I think if you are in general do yours what WABC does and if you value that six seven eight five five three\nNinety nine to your on line a WD eat out or because your support your additional gift not today either as a new or sustaining or an additional gift at the level that is right for you and also today the Atlanta community food bank will receive a pound a food\nSix seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety on line at W. ab eat out of work and thanks ...\nWith your new sustaining donation of twenty dollars a month or a single contribution of two hundred and forty dollars you can choose a package of one hundred meals for the Atlantic community food bank these meals we'll go to help families need all over Atlanta across North Georgia so another meal packages yours with your new sustaining donation of twenty dollars a month\nGive to great gifts at once this fall\nOn line uh WABC dot org or coal six seven eight by five three Ninety Ninety six\nSupport for W.
