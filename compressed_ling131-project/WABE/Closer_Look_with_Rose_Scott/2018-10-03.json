H. B. E. Atlantis choice sprint are as always I'm Rose Scott\nTime now to talk about a word we all love development and then put a new word in front of that new development work early this year we discuss new development underway on Atlanta's west side\nIt's called Corey yards and now in phase one alone pay attention it's a ... million dollar twenty seven ... mixed use development and will tell you where and just a moment and the first phase involves office and retail space as well as something's going to learn about adaptive reuse buildings\nBut that's not all the development last include west side park and bill with Cory which is slated to be the city's largest park and there's always a major concern whenever there's a new development that's on the way other affordable options and what does it look like\nWell joining me again is Joel Bowman a partner with urban creek partners they are the developers who Corey\nOr it's good to see if you're just see you again how are you All right we should note that your part in the market share it was going to join us he somewhere in Chicago at O'Hare Airport would you have\nThe most confusing airport ever yep [laughter] we're glad to have you let's begin hearing described for our listeners the exact location of Corey are just sort of paint the picture of where all this development is taking place so\nIt is a directly adjacent to the back in ... right on Donnelly hollow parkway the ... is about sixty plus acres um the south side of ... is about ... acres so it kind of wraps and ...\nAnd when this is all completed we're talking about\nSprawling over Seventy acres is that true that's true All right ... the CIA that is so far is easy and now here comes the we get into now so let's talk about this term mixed use job because you know depending on who you ask you get a different answer we talk about mixed you you're talking about retail and residential and commercial and\nAll those five things and make us want to live work and play in that area is that right\nThat is correct so as a planner I get into some a lot and there's a multi use which is everybody in their own little silos and mixed uses when everybody plays together they worked together they have options they have the ability to do a lot of different things and community can get involved as well so it's a that's a true mixed use\nLet's talk about what you just said the community gets involved because the last time you were here and I was pressuring you about let's talk about the community and you are really did you really just sit down you talked to community leaders you talk to residents in the community see what they want it\nYes correct what'd you we heard job opportunities\nA a place for the community where about or can we live obviously that is a big portion of it so residential where can we live where can we work work and we hang out on the weekends and how do we restore sense of community to an area that had um you know been neglected and and not one that somebody wants to go too often\nWell it's been the focus of a lot of a program in a lot of content segments devoted to that area when you talk about areas had been neglected and\nWe've had this conversation before because that gee where it comes in are you going in are you going to\nJustify this community and I won't say on this program will justification is not a bad thing rose just depends on how you look at it and the execution of it what is the outcome right if the execution is that you're displacing a lot of longtime residents\nThat's a bad thing is the execution that you're bringing new development in which might create jobs but also allows from those longtime residents to stay there it's a good thing\nRight when you thought [noise] I mean I I think it's creating new opportunities that embraced everybody at all levels and that's what we're trying to do um we're trying to bring up\nHousing to ah the first phase the project will be a hundred and Seventy seven affordable housing we've we've formed a partnership of press with that we're very proud of I'm sort of leading with affordable housing were leading with green space we're leading with\nAreas that are abandoned warehouses have been sitting there for Thirty years with no use and no jobs and no potential right next door ...\nAffordable housing would as that looked like because affordable depending on when you ask a miniature if rent is Eighteen hundred that might be affordable for somebody or if it's somewhere in between you know eight hundred to a thousand that's a lot more affordable for another individual or family\nRight so the first project with press like as a hundred and Seventy seven units eighty five percent of those units are going to be at fifty to sixty percent am I\nThe last Fifteen Percent is going to be at at the eighty present a mind of the workforce housing so really anybody to mix between twenty six thousand dollars a year can qualify to sixty thousand dollars a year so we feel that hits a really really good job on\nOur porch and was that for you on you being a part of urban creek partners that you did include that\nWell I mean we we see this as a Fifteen year project at least that we're going to be involved in for the whole Seventy acres we're going to be around we've talked to the community extensively over the last year year and a half so I mean\nWe're going to be a steward of the project and for us to deliver that phase one first project right off the bat is I think staying to our mission staying to what we believe in and um and we got to the point now I feel like you know weren't dependable right and the community is looking at us to deliver\nSo prior to this project\nGetting off the ground and you and I both we've had this conversation before you look at around the city of Atlanta and all this development that's going on and all the concerns about affordability and equity and and all of that\nDid you won't look at whether or not you were being leaders doing something new and different because you look at other projects they may say well as long as we have Fifteen Percent affordability where are you a little bit more than it sounds like\nYeah we are and and I think um we're not your typical developers you know we did probably everything backwards at a developer does you know we bought\nLanguage anyone tell people that [laughter] yeah we we bought land ten years ago we got involved in the community helped them they helped us with the master plan and we also fell in love with the land which I tell you not to do and the project so we drank\nThe Kool Aid and this is the only thing that we're doing right now we're not looking at any other projects and we're going to put our had on this one and we're going to do it right\nYou mentioned jobs which is so important particularly for that area of town because you and I both know that can spur economic development because people have jobs maybe they can afford to stay in the neighborhood you have no that's important\nThis is a member support it Ninety point one W ab Atlanta\n\nAnd cultural continues now you're on ... point one W. H. B. E. Atlanta choice for NPR is always I'm Rose Scott as October rose in and it's the seasonal pumpkins and Halloween costumes it's also a time when awareness about the upcoming hold it\nFlu season begins now this past flu season was recorded as one of the deadliest in the last decade\nWhile an exact number of adult death relieves the lord never exact we do know that family one hundred and eighty flu related pediatric desk reported last year which leads to these women are your questions this time of year what does this year's flu strain look like and what should people know\nWhere earlier today I spoke with Ashley folk she's an epidemiologist and the Centers for Disease Control and prevention food vision and our conversation began with folks optimism about matching the shoes vaccine\nTo the influenza strain\nWell we monitor through the season how the vaccine is performing of it it does take time to get the answer to that question last year's flu vaccine was estimated to have a forty percent effectiveness meaning that it prevented the forty percent\nOf flu illnesses from requiring medical care mhm uh this changes by the different viruses that circulate but ... was about forty percent so we'll keep monitoring that through\nThis season and hope that it will be even better at in for the coming year\nAnd folks you know it is really difficult to I guess you'd call it matching the vaccine to the strength on a yearly basis is that correct\nAbsolutely we monitored globally we have a global network that monitors flu vaccine strains and we base our selection each season on the most carefully collected data that we possibly can have a but at the same time we're having to manufacture\nVaccines far before the season comes and unfortunately flu is really good at changing every year and we can't really\nBe a hundred percent certain until we get into the season what we're going to find\nAnd coming into the segment I mentioned the challenges in Akron we recording flu related deaths were adults why is it so challenging\nIt is very challenging and what we do is we estimate we monitor the hospitalization rates and then account for different testing practices in different reporting practices and then different qualities of the test and from that\nWe can make an estimate of how many hospitalizations there are a in the country then once we know that hospitalization number we can also track us through a a\nVital statistics data a and the hospitals data the number of deaths that are associated so that's how we get those numbers we can also look backwards that medical care speaking and they estimate for all types of\nInfluenza illnesses medical attended a doctor's visit for flu basically\nA and then uh that's how we get all of those various number for the pediatric death the one hundred and eighty unfortunately also only represents those that are reported so even those are an estimate\nThat is probably the tip of the iceberg\nAnd let's go over because I Know our listeners really want to pay attention to this let's go over okay who should get the flu shot we always hear about those who might have you know a compromised immune system or we always hear about the aging population and also children is that the same standards should everyone get a flu shot\nYou actually the the the vaccine recommendations are really simple everyone over the age of six months should get the flu shot 'em\nIt's especially important for the groups that you mentioned we have a groups that are at high risk of developing these serious complications from flu and it's a very broad list if anyone age sixty five an older children under five pregnant women\nAnd then people with certain have common chronic conditions such as diabetes heart disease asthma immune compromised\nAnd most important is also to think about even if you don't have one of those conditions how common on that list was and the fact that you can be\nIn contact with someone who is at high risk for developing severe flu and you can protect yourself from spreading to them\nThe great thing about technology that it's not only through a flu shot with the needle that you can get the vaccine correct\nThat is correct we do have again this year the a nasal spray vaccine\nAnd the other courses when should one get vaccinated\nWe can never know flu is highly variable and it can start as early as October and\nSo we recommend that uh everyone be vaccinated by the end of October uh and this gives plenty of time to develop the immunity because your body does need to at least a couple of weeks\nAnd then also for a young children getting their first vaccination ah they will need two doses of the vaccine twenty eight days apart the starting in October is really a minimum for that group\nAnd how common is it that during this flu season there may or may be a new virus\nUnfortunately that does happen or the virus can change as a substantially\nEven if it's not a new virus but have enough of a difference from the one selected for vaccine strains ah\nThat that the vaccine as less effective but even in the vaccines that we've found that are less effective they're still overall effective and also the vaccine has several types of viruses\nThat in the back and live a vaccine and if it protects against two out of the three circulating strains in the community that's still a whole lot better than no protection at all\nAnd and actually just real quickly I Want to get some clarity on why children require two doses of the flu vaccine which took to dissect a formula but more\nCertainly up for their first vaccinations up the immune system needs a little bit of an additional boost\nA to really develop that full immunity I'm In these ah younger\nImmune systems so that first doses of is considered a priming dose and gives some amount um a oven unity but then a twenty eight days later a second does brings the child up to the level of protection that you would expect an\nOlder child over the age of nine or an adult to have against uh uh I flew from the vaccine\nAnd as we wrap up its ... year lot okay are you telling me that if I get this who shot I Will not get the flu I don't think I've ever heard any health officials say that but you always have to ask that question each year can you tell listeners what the flu why the importance of the flu shot he does not prevent you from getting the flu but\nIt does it for to prevent the influenza infections a hundred percent but it is extremely important to get vaccinated very simply the flu vaccination can save lives we have studies that have shown that it can save children's lives\nIt can protect pregnant women and their influence after they're born\nOr it can help prevent serious medical events and the chronic conditions\nPatients uh and then it can overall reduce the risk of flu illness and serious complications like hospitalization ICU admission and very simply it can just help you get back on your feet again if you do get sick\nAnd actually folks is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and prevention which of course his base right here in Atlanta Georgia actually thank

letter to state secretary of state telling them that they oppose photo ID\nSo if you didn't support photo ID or did support photo ID in two thousand sixty obviously changed his position where he wrote that letter and twenty love him\nWell let's get to that than since this is our opening this debate in Mr ... start with you what is your position as relates to having photo ID to either registered to vote or for when someone goes into actually cast a ballot what is your position should be both one or the other\nOkay so you know the the strict voter id um has been implemented in Georgia since two thousand six since two thousand six voter id has been starting to gaining traction across the country I Want the listeners know that before two thousand six it wasn't required hardly anywhere\nUm you know I I it's not about all I really want to fight I think that ah is more important and it would probably be more advantageous to help those you need to get a free id help them get the originating documentation and a lot of people don't understand\nThat if the originating documentation that makes it difficult to get the idea of like\nHaving to get a a you know a birth certificate for fifty seven dollars are having to get a divorce decree to prove a name change that's what makes the voter ID laws or you know a factor that suppression because they just make it a bureaucratic hurdle to actually get those typical types of things\nI like I said let's just help both I get the origin of documentation and um then\nYou know move on to other the other issues that um would help them to be able to\nMr Barrett let's be clear as it relates right now to voter id for identification do you support that it'd be made available that a person has to show it for to register or only when they're casting a ballot or both\nBelieve you ought to be required to do both but I think ... is right on\nThere is a very very small percentage of our population that literally cannot qualify for the new fangled kind of photo ID at the federal government has requires since two thousand and five because of the nine eleven commission recommendations I voted for those recommendations to tighten\nState id requirements so that we wouldn't these are these IDs would actually means something but I also recognize that there's a very small percentage of the population probably less than one percent\nThat cannot get the originating documents as ... said the court house burned down in there is no birth certificate I mean we can accommodate people who've been voting for forty or fifty years since the voting rights act even though they cannot get one of these new ideas and\nI have voted for requirements if it was produced a days but I've also insisted that that must be a reasonable accommodation for those obviously eligible citizens\nTwo for reasons beyond their control can I get the new kind of IDs that most of us take for granted today and that's the difference between me and bread\nAnd ... now you live are more clear and your stance on that\nWant to see a I've been very clear that I support photo ID where a lot of them for ... for registering and at the polling located at the polling location correct but the the point of going back to where the salt\nReally evolved in two thousand five there was a bipartisan commission for federal election integrity and that was chaired by President Jimmy Carter as secretary of state Baker and out of that they have a hundred hundred and twenty pages I've read the thing\nAnd and has several different concerns that they had\nAnd then also things that they would recommend one of the things that came out of that they said if you've ever had a D. R. E. machine which is what we have right now you should always have a paper audit trail\nAnd in Georgia we have not had that and that's why when we update the new voting machines we need to make sure that we have a paper ballot system that's in place so that people have something that they actually look touching feel when they go back to do a recount so that's very important\nAnd then they also talked about the absentee ballot process and how to strengthen that\nThat's very interesting reading the the history of President Jimmy Carter and how you became a state senator and the\nFolks that are ... tried to really stuffed the ballot box so he wouldn't become a state senator and that was one of those really Democrat versus Democrat but it's just a great history lesson and that's why I really what he's done at the Carter center is and that's why he cares so much about having clean fair elections and I support that also\nWhat was your effort I Want to stay with you because in order of this way I Would be starting with you as it relates to security which you've just been talking about we know that Georgia election officials were warned almost two years ago that the state's electronic voting system could easily breached\nIs elected sex or state what immediately would you do to implement better security measures I mean you talked about in terms of the actual elections having a paper trail but what about the overall system well\nIt's it's several components really it's first of all your the confidential voter database that needs to be secured and that's one that's one conversation the second the first part of that conversation with voting machines\nAre believed that coming out of the safe commission we're going to get recommendations I Believe that general assembly the sense of the general assembly is to pass legislation to fund a new voting machines and not make it so much so specific but given a platform a guideline of ... what they need to have what are the guard rails it\nAnd we'll put that out to bed low qualified better\nGet those purchased and get those up and running my goal is to have those up and running for the next election and twenty Nineteen when we have our local elections\nBecause that's our trial run because generally for local elections come from a city council background you get five six percent of the population that's a great way to do a trial run then we're ready for the presidential primary twenty twenty and then for the twenty twenty up new voting machines [noise]\nTime probably won't let me get dig into really cyber security ... make sure that we maintain the security of our voter database that is critical when you think that Facebook hack last week was fifty million you know people their informations out there and also one of the credit reporting agencies based on when I\nHad over one third of all American Social Security numbers out their hackers never sleep and nor can I\nWas a barrel if elected as Georgia's next after state would immediately do you want to do in terms of implementing better security measures\nLike Rome I've already called for it back in January of this year I called for us to follow Georgia law as it is currently written as it was written in two thousand and two when he bought these machines\nAnd call for a process to certify these machines in accordance with the procedure outlawed and state law because it has been proven to the satisfaction of the public\nAnd to the courts that these machines can be hacked at that time I called the certification process began while the general assembly was in session and when we could have gotten the resources to get the supplemental machines that are able to use optical scanners to count\nAnd march paper ballots and pleased that ...\nJoined me later this year in July of this year he joined in the cold and I made back in February of two calls that he certification these machines and well Brad says it's his goal to have these machines in place for the next election it's been his policy up till now to do nothing to call for that in this year's election when there was time to do it\nThe court that recently passed on opportunity to impose this did so because it wasn't enough time to do it but there was time back in February there was time in July and but it's been the polished\nMy opponent on the Republican side to do everything possible to whistle past the graveyard to pretend this issue is not revealed to have your head in the sand in the courts language until after this election\nWe should have some leadership on this area he\nIs a part of the legislature that supposed to make sure the secretary of state is doing his job and following the law the secretary of state supposed to the job of telling the legislature when these things have to be retired there's been a failure of leadership on both sides and my Republican opponent was to continue that policy of failure of leadership in the next ... minutes ration that needs to change\nThis recipe you can respond with reference burgers he likes to get mentioned vote\nThe court has ruled that we're going to be using these voting machines\nSo that dies been cast ... my commitment is and I believe the commitment a gentle suddenly have new voting machines for next year because they don't they will be used uh with the existing machine so I think they understand that time to make the changes now\nThe government a state of Georgia has I guess I'm come back out of the great recession so we've just fully fund the QB we've\nThe right to build the rainy day fund is now it's time and so you know we will have new voting machines for twenty Nineteen\nMission to value mentioned that you have experienced an IT field so data security cyber security if you are let the secretary of state what's the first measure you would like to implement if you can as it relates to George is voting system and overall the security of all the voters and all the information that ... that's held within the secretary of state's office well get me started\nOkay fair of um you know the for the for the listeners about two and a half weeks ago there was a federal court case of a coalition of good government\nUh sued Brian camping the secretary of state's office about the security and not taking seriously the threat that we have\nAnd just to position this for ... off fireworks um there's been a threat for many many years these machines that voting machines we have now have not been patched or anything for many many years they should have been replaced eight years ago at minimum okay\nBut the thing that we're at now is that Barry that hadn't stand the secretary of state has been negligent\nAnd doing this this job\nYou know right at the money as the rest of my time to tell what Georgia voters need to do now 'cause we should have to certify these machines John Barrow is exactly right we should have to certify them I changed my mind wants that came in the press the Russians were analyzing our Web sites that escalated the risk priority at this time to take action\nGeorgia voters if what you need to do is go out and apply to request an absentee paper ballot request an absentee paper ballot when you get that ballot\nWouldn't you think that I Would be the best person for this job not only for the people in Georgia but also for a Republican [noise]\nNo I I Believe I'm the best person for this job that's why I'm running for it so uh the case closed but what I said yesterday is that you can make a case on other why should the secretary of states\nThis be elected or should be appointed by the governor\nAnd so first of all people need to realize that the way the constitution set up in Georgia we have a very powerful former governor so in effect what you're doing but they gave me even more power to the governor many people do not realize that it wasn't only until the Nineteen sixties\nThat the state house actually started picking their speaker of the house until that time the governor's had always pick the the speakers of the house so they've got the fact that power\nAnd I'm sure that the speaker Austin's very happy with that and so it was every other speakers since that point but the point is is that we have a very powerful form or do you want to give that more power to a governor whoever that is whatever party but also a governor if he is elected or she is elected\nDemocrat or Republican or whatever party is probably going to pick someone with the same mindset and say share the same principle in other words that can be from the same party\nSo it's really just something at the end of the day it will still be some which shares the same Republican or Democrat leanings I Believe that what it is in a partisan position once you're having a Democrat run a Republican or a libertarian run\nThen you know what they stand for and if they do a bad job I guess what in four years you can throw him out of office\nMr berry you have an option you can ask another candidate question or if he wanted to follow up from the last conversation you can moderator privilege I Will allow that\nHow about if I Do both out just to say the reason for not paying taxes this year is because there's a provision of the law says it hadn't been term about quarter of a law that you owe the taxes then you can not you're not disqualified\nAnd that's the that's basically to provide a safety valve for people who commit a mistake and who ... I didn't know about this kind of problem and they can take care of it without being disqualified brand new abide and eleven nobody in Fifteen divided and Eighteen we ought to have somebody to do the right thing that when they're forced to do it but I Want to ask a question just mice\nNot spice libertarian candidate frankly don't get the respect that they do their ... oftentimes overlooked by and ignored by people say my opponent referring to the you know the other party's nominee I Would have treat you with a certain amount of respect and since you and I both believe in rank voting I'm gonna ask you a ranked voting question All right\nYou and I both support getting rid of these the already machines this year we both called for it you and I both support making the secretary of state's office nonpartisan ended a genuine a nonpartisan fashion so it'll stay that way despite the at the ... the distractions posed by by reading his characterization of the alternative\nYou and I both believe in gerrymandering reform you and I both believe in hand mark ballots with optical scanners you and I believe in rank voting a number of other reforms now want you to assume\nThat there's going to be a runoff in this election and unfortunately you're not going to be in it if there was a runoff between me and my Republican opponent which one would you support on the grounds of election reform well\nThank you so much a first thing I I really appreciate a pre shape that thank you very much ah\nI disagree with the premise of your question in the sense that I might not be in the run off because I'm offering Georgia voters something they don't have right now and that is the editor of anti I understand that I got to finish their ... you know an act genuine change and you're not going to get genuine change from a you know\nI mean you guys are both guys of integrity but when it comes right down to it you all serve the your parties and is the weather when it comes down to whether it's your party is going to get ahead or whether it's going to be in the best ... uh you know uh for the people of Georgia you serve your parties and that's been proven time and time again\nRank choice voting you know that is that is a no brainer and I am very happy to hear it or what I Would like to hear from you know\nA Democrat leadership or from Republican leadership or for those who are sick and tired of Democrats and Republicans is is that we start putting things in place like rent choice voting so that we moved beyond this partisanship this awful awful partisanship that we have because there is no future in it\nThere's absolutely no future in and how we are running this country right now\nAnd we need to change that ran choice voting it'd be a absolute wonderful thing for Georgia\nThe county's would save millions of dollars and run a saving money on runoff expenses and we would increase competition political competition that would benefit everyone especially our communities thank you Mr Duval\nThe stresses that you may ask a question to a fellow candidate\n[noise]\nGift to Mr Deval why do you ...\nHaving a ... district and commission and taking the power away from the general assembly to select the districts [noise]\nYou know that is a great question so the I'm all for listeners out there when we talked about gerrymandering what we're talking about\nIs the ability to draw district lines\nAnd right now I'm the Republican Party in the state of Georgia has drawn a line to favor their party when the Democrats were in power in the early to thousands of age drew it into a favor of their party and what happens is that they are the politicians are picking the voters the voters are not picking the politicians\nThis is such a serious serious issue that we've had three cases in front of the Supreme Court this year I don't think that there is a great solution with this in terms of single member districts but at the same time it is something that we must challenge\nWith twenty first century gerrymandering that's the power of computers\nAll right and you have the all the data from Facebook from Google\nAnd you have the powerful mapping software and the predictability voters you can draw a district through people's backyards down the streets you can select voters with precision and it's possible now for\nGerrymandering map makers to create a permanent majority party in a permanent minority party\nAnd all they have to do is have control of those maps\nThis is an integrity issue to representative democracy we must tackle gerrymandered to sort of oddly\nYou have one more question that you may ask to fellow Kenneth\nOh I think you are yes I'm so\nJohn similar question to what I was asking them a brown I'm yesterday Veronica waters or ask a question about whether the secretary of state office should be a nonpartisan office and I'm I'm choosing this question because I was a very delighted that this question's actually coming up in this race [noise]\nUm you know\nThere is a conflict of interest um and Democrats and Republicans I'm using their partisan advantage um gerrymandering was a perfect case voter suppression is about a perfect case\nYesterday you agreed with me I'm Alan today on the show you agreed with me that uh there should be a nonpartisan office so wouldn't it follow that given that I'm neither Democrat or Republican that I'm the best choice for this up for this office\nWhile you're very kind to pose it that way but you are a partisan candidates represent your party any party of as as a group of people who align themselves to advance of political cause here's the calls we can agree on\nAnd it's something that bred disagrees with us on this office ought to be a non partisan office\nBut yesterday you heard him give the usual distraction while we can't really make it nonpartisan 'cause if it's ever filled by the voters on that basis well there's always a vacancy and you get a real partisan governors don't feel that vacancy and before you know at the dice are loaded kind of like with our courts I address that problem yesterday\nAnd it was ignored by Brad today if you really want this to be a non partisan office\nAnd he was elected on a nonpartisan ballot in in the usual manner but you require that it'd be filled by that manner exclusively so that there ever is a vacancy in that office through death of disqualification or whatever\nThen the voters will choose the successor in precisely the same manner as they chose the predecessor this is how it is done\nFor the United States House of representatives it is the only body and federal government that cannot be appointed by anybody you can only be filled by a vote of the electors\nSame with our representatives and the general assembly and if they really believe this office which has a lot of election issues to dispose of can can and should be operated in a non partisan fashion there's only two ways to do this make it really nonpartisan for\nBest thing yet find the most bipartisan person out there to do the job and I got that going away in spades in this election because I have the record of being the most bipartisan member of Congress running for reelection kayaking twenty four it didn't take it to spare\nHis respirator would you like to respond to mention you buy a brat [laughter] well what I Would say again\nI've always told myself accountable to the voters and I think that's the best way for all of us\nPeople have been disillusioned with government for a several period several years probably ten Fifteen Years uh people want to make sure that their voices are heard and so when you elect folks such as your secretary of state or any other position\nThen you're really accountable to the voters when you have independent not elected you know boards and commissions are doing that redistricting than all of a sudden there's no accountability there who did it well it's some board it's we want to be may be able to make sure that we hold people accountable and you do that once elected position\nJust like they have did with the Democrats the Democrats gerrymandered at the two thousand and two and they got bounced out in the ear and that's why the Republicans took over bad government that policies betcha legislators and so when you hold people accountable", "year": "2018",
