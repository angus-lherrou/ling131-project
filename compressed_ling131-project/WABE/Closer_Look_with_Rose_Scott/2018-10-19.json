broadcast from earlier today\n[noise] [noise]\nHello nice to have a\nA R\nYes things I own a a word\nRe road all the\nDay I was on the\nYou pass the time\nYou know the red zone in law which\nAgain in a\nYou know\nA\nYo yo yo and will you go down as well as you do you do you know\nYou go on\n\nI really don't\nBut for freelancers they just don't have that something that is just like a regular illness that gets bad and you just need to rest you break your leg and you just need to not put weight on it shouldn't be a big problem\nIt should just be a problem but what happens is people go right into bankruptcy they go into a credit card debt and that's why we said we need to start something that after one week of being sick or injured you get fifty percent of your income\nFor up to twelve weeks and you'd think that that would exist right didn't just doesn't sound that hard but freelancers don't have it and they're really exposed\nEconomically without it and it starts at eleven dollars a month and so what we did is we said let's be entrepreneurial let's stick together let's have some solidarity let's build this together and so what we found in Georgia is that we've already put together a great group\nOf advisers who are in our new economy collective\n... and we've been getting together for lunch and people are welcome to join us at ... dot com come sign up\nAnd we have lunch and talk and build and strategize about how we start to build the safety net in Atlanta and of course one thing I've learned as a Brooklyn I coming to Atlanta that you always have to say parking as free and that's very interesting cultural difference\nLet's talk about your book let's be specific to this is what we call a freelance insurance now covers injuries and accidents what exactly are we talking about a year\nYeah so uh let me just say first that troop poet has a disability plan and with our partner or Ga we provide\nVery short term disability so that let's say you have you've broken your leg and you are a massage therapist and you can't put weight on it\nYou can't work what if you work with your hands and you break your arm what if you have that kind of pneumonia that gets so bad you can't take your laptop into bed with you and work which is why I freelancers do way too often and so those are the kinds of things that are covered\nIt's the unexpected things that hit people which is why you want to ensure\nGeorgia as one of the I guess the the first market for ...\nWell I think George is one of the most exciting freelancer places in the country they're just so many new emerging fields from film and television creative technology to having the big headquarters of\nCoke and FedEx and all these big companies are using freelancers and [noise]\nIt's just a place that's really affordable and creative they are moving there from the coasts in record numbers and I really think that when you spend a lot of time with freelancers they're kind of the ultimate crafts\nPeople they really are about excellence and the culture that they create is uh I I find one of the most exciting ones in in the country and not\nJust exciting but solid ... if you couldn't believe that people have to rely on each other to do well and so freelancers teach us these lessons about taking care of one another and coming together and in Georgia this is this is the place this is like the ... the center for it\nWell let's talk about the true bowl in terms of you are making sure you have your you know you started freelancers union so now you're offered this short term disability so let's talk about\nTroop all in terms of making sure you are including everything that a freelancer might need in that short term disability who some of the consultants who are you working with and and you know to make sure that\nThis is just like any other short term disability we see the commercials with the little duck\nYou know you know so\nThat that's a great question so let me just say first of all this doesn't exist anywhere you you actually can't get that there's longer term disability that others can getting typically they get it through their job but this is really saying freelancers face a very short term risk\nSo we the team at who uh came from the freelancers union or season we've built insurance companies before we work with the top actuaries in the country\nAnd we work with our Ga our partner and their actuaries and so we have built a product\nThat is designed around freelancers as every freelancer knows one of the worst moments is interacting with insurance and finance 'cause you're made to feel weird was reading about it too [laughter] that's true right\nAh but what is what we've tried to do is at ... dot com and it's spelled T R U P oh is that you come on it's a really easy process designed around people who have episodic income\nAnd we know that that's the hardest thing for freelancer so we said hey we know that's a problem we know your income goes up and down you have terrible dry spells and that's\nA good year right but what we've done is said during those periods we're going to have an affordable plan\nYou pay that monthly and then if something like this happens it covers you after one week and it will pay you fifty percent of your earning so you can pay your rent you can pay groceries just to keep you going so you can get back to work which is what freelancers want to do\nThe voice you here's Sara Horowitz she's the founder of the freelancers union but now we're talking about truthful and in ... it's an inch so much call it an insurance product the short term disability product is that a good way of ... ... yeah yeah for freelance workers and it was recently last year and George and that's what I Want to ask you about also mental health\nDoes your do you have a desert or component of this plan it also covers mental health\nYes yes so it's if you think about it as it's not for like the regular problems or like you know I'm tired and I want to take a paid week off\nOr I see my therapist once a week it's really designed if you have a a serious mental health incident that as cover what about\nAn overdose or\nIn his base of opioids and you know prescription medicines\nDoes this plan and okay it's when so what what happens is if something happens you go to your health professional a doctor or a physician's assistant a nurse practitioner and they have to verify that this is happening and then that's the kind of thing that's covered\nAnd so like insurance you know if you think about like a hurricane insurance it's designed for that\nThat situation that can happen to you and you want to protect your assets so it's income protection so that you don't end up bankrupt\nOr in credit card debt or wearing and you know what I found with freelancers as we all know that you're told you put forty cents in a checking account and sixty cents and your savings account to pay for your time\n... and your benefits so people know that they're already saving like three hundred dollars a month for these kinds of emergencies or they worry that they should\nAnd when we come together and insurance it means you don't have to save that much you just have to have the premium so that if that happens\nYou're covered and then you have that extra money that maybe you should put in your retirement or saving up for um a down payment on something\nAnd so what we're really talking about it to pose is how do you build your safety net that personally and then you start to build that together and that's why we love to have people come and join us at ...\nFor lunches let's be clear though about some some some conditions or you know we lack of better were some things that aren't covered planned eve plans leaving pregnancy that is not covered correct\nYeah so what uh is covered typically in a longer\nTerm disability would be maternity or the ability to to go when you're when you're pregnant 'cause this is designed around one week to twelve week so that wouldn't be covered a regular mental health visits for therapy wouldn't be covered\nI'm a plastic surgery or elective surgery would not be covered it's really the bigger emergencies and your uh in your life\nAnd I went to an end and you can go through that it if you go to ... dot com you can see what's covered and what is your party clearly because you'll have something you cite is dangerous behavior\nHow would you define it like you know if you are a\nI don't know you you teach sky diving [laughter] what would I what do you consider do you mean give me an example of dangerous behavior yeah I mean I think it's something that is just\nThat puts yourself regularly and in harm's way like that would be an example and a sport or in a it's something that you would choose to do and like\n... are a magicians assistant and where he you know takes the blades and cuts in half and all that stuff\n... and by assuming let's say you're a magician didn't didn't know know how to do that one but sword swallowing might come\nTo mind it's you know it it sounds you know we're I'm laughing but people should know you know be very exact in terms of because when I hear this segment\nYou know you have a lot of people that will want to know more so getting information out as important I Want to end with or nothing because as you said\nLook twenty twenty seven the majority of workers will be in this freelancer this gig economy as your as we call it so by the time I imagine you might have some some competition to UC your model

H. B. E. Atlanta choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott you know there's a reason why we're plane that that version that instrumental will get that in a moment because for every Ron well there's a reason right so we're going to go back to Sunday may for two thousand and eight\nBelonged to read for those of you who are younger and don't know the old school\nYou know the words of disgraced philosopher and mystic that says mother's mother there too many of you crying ... brother brother brother they're far too many of you dying you know we've got to find a way the\nBrings some loving gear today that's\nAll they'll fall though we don't need to escalate for war is not the end of the\nOnly love can conquer hate\nThat is the Reverend Dr Dwight Andrew delivering a Sunday sermon like he has for so many times that first congressional church here in Atlanta since Nineteen Ninety nine to be exact however\nRevert Andrews is celebrating and be celebrated it reaches forty years of ministry and mission so we turned today's conversation to religious faith politics and the journey of driven doctored white Andrews welcome\nSir it's great to be with you and what a wonderful piece to begin with\nI said man look at revenues using Marvin Gaye and his arm and that's all right\nThat's Marvin is he is to philosophy for yeah well as the domestic and really in in some way to kind of profit right now in the music that he spoke to really twenty five thirty years ago was describing right where we are still\nResonates now want to clear some up because of that land and folks have rumors you are not retiring\nOh no I'm just celebrate for for decades right that's right I'm not dead yet I still got a few more decades ago but we're celebrating dishes a time when I look back over the last forty years\nAnd I was ordained on Martin Luther king's birthday January Fifteen Nineteen Seventy eight\nSo we just thought this would be a perfect time to celebrate these first for decades\nAnd also to commemorate Dr King and his vision for beloved community and really to begin the next chapter first ... church safe just celebrate a hundred and fifty years when was the oldest black church second in the in congressional in the nation correct that's right second congregation church second oldest exactly\nIn that clip that I played a Reverend because you went on to talk about the role of the black church and and that's what I like to begin our conversation because as human\nSo you're again in Nineteen Seventy eight you see then and now is that the black church that rule the same as it evolved is it involving hit and not have all the ...\nI think that the the same potential existed in Nineteen Seventy eight that exist today but I think for black churches we have the struggle of being relevant and being kind of self critical of where we are and how we're doing\nAnd in many ways I think that this is a difficult in sad time because I don't think the black church has responded as well as they could to the really difficult challenges of the day you know it's it was easier when people would say whites only a and so the issues of segregation and\nThe kinds of oppression that we're really in a parent\nOr now much more um subverted and so I think our challenges at the same but I think we've underestimated the nature of of the challenge\nWho do you think then I don't want to say is responsible or should we the black folks or any folks hold accountable is it the faith leader in the church is\nNo I don't think so and it's not to let the faith leader off the hook I think the issue is that we all share a mutual responsibility to one another\nAnd in fact that's what excites me about the black church and the ideas that we're all in the struggle together and the tradition that I grew up in the congregation of tradition everyone saw themselves as a as a worker a cultural worker a spiritual worker bee\nAnd so if you think about the great leaders in our tradition like Andy young uh Andy always saw himself is really just a part of the the work and and not as the leader per se\n[noise] you know last night I moderated a conversation already MRI scan and chapel and I asked the question to the panel about the definition of moral leadership when they ask you that question how you define it\nWell I think I think a moral leadership is really a decisions in a way of processing decisions and living a based on a moral center\nAnd for many years the black church a had a moral center because it believed in social justice and witness not because it was a political idea but that's what Jesus taught to love your neighbors know strangers to share whatever is had that there might be enough\nAnd I think it's that vision that provides for the moral leaders\nAnd moral leadership the real interesting thing is that in some ways I think the leadership has been corrupted if you will by um by commerce by the president age in which a leadership has become so pragmatic so we don't think about principle\nAnd so I'm Still trying to find a way to stay on the principal because I think that's what brought me here\nWell let's talk about bringing you here because I played some Motown era earlier and you're from the motor as they call it that's where I D and you're quite musician I'm let folks know because you were in his band called seven\nSound it made me you also for parliament last right you were hanging out with George Clinton well I wouldn't call here now [laughter]\nBecause you know the funny part about about those days as I thought that um that George Clinton in parliament I thought that they were really not going to ever be anything because they were just too wild too far out they were wearing diapers and\nVote gains in army belts\nAnd here we love a ship with land the mother ship was an addict but we had matching ... church and bell bottoms and so I thought we were the way forward but look [laughter] ah but they were very instructive because George I mean they really were pointing to the future oh man it's we could have a whole nother calmly asked but I Want to ask\nYou about then we always talk about with someone has a moment or the call to serve it and that calling inside of you was it even then president when you were in the seventh sounds and you know we're into frills bell bottoms\nI think it was a the calling was beginning and I'm In some ways it took a long time to unfold for me um it definitely started in the days that I was rehearsing was my rock and roll band and the church basement but it was really the pastor of the church was so busy doing things in the community\nThey quietly set the message in my head that there might be another path for me uh he never said it but he just kind of show that this guy by the name of it could uh and Nick was\nKind of my second dad my mentor but believe it or not he had been at a young second dead or in New Orleans two generations before where he began his ministry so I think in some ways our relationship is formed because we shared the same parentage\nCan you put into words what they're calling feels like or is it just it or is it something that unless you feel it you can't really explain it [noise]\nI think for me it just provide a way of thinking about what I Do when I get up and what I Do when I get up his I decide how am I going to make this mess better\nAnd that's the only question I ask and so it gives me um it gives me a way of thinking about the day it which I never get tired I never get bored because the problems and the challenges as well as the possibilities are never ending\nThink about who you'll be without us propaganda\nWhat Jay Giedd when you're going slightly off script here okay really your pledge bitch frankly sounds like a threat\nExactly we crush their egos then they're like party they'll give us whatever we want\nOkay just try and be a little yeah in fact to say look let's skip to the third script [noise] okay I've got that one day and and try not to drift from the microphone in Vermont yeah okay there we go [noise] ... yes\nThe pledge drivers unpleasant factors those of us would listen to this radio station should be the ones who funded that's only fair there

All right [laughter] and a programming note also you're going to hear from one of the movements leaders Dr Loni king look\nTo you all thank you for coming in and taking the time\nI drank or at the beginning of this year we launched a project called ... sixty eight and we looked at the fifty years since the assassination of Dr Martin Luther king junior\nWhen you look at the last fifty years or so more what are your reflections on where this country has come on issues of civil rights and and I'm going to start Dr ... want to start with you\nThere than periods during the last fifty years where it seemed as if we might have been making some progress\nAt this point uh looking back from Nineteen sixty I'm not sure we've come all that far if if we have we've slid backwards\nI think a lot of that has to do with our current leader who seems determined to take us backwards um but I don't feel [noise]\nProgress that I have felt over the fifty years um we didn't start out with a young black men being shot on a regular basis by policeman [noise] um\nI Can't say much improvement and and some of our market as like a poverty and jobs and\nThey're still so much ground to cover and it seems as if maybe recover but I'm not feeling terribly optimistic right now ... ... what about you [noise]\nI tend to agree with Ross ah we made in the decades or\nOf the sixties we made tremendous progress but for some reason we did not consolidate that ... so we're we're ... we have been tracked slip back or a drug I don't think there's any question about it or are\nThere have been individual successes but if you look at the group as a whole like for ... group uh\nWe we we're about where we were fifty years ago\nOh this is a little ... what do you think of how our agreeing with both of them I I other than my\nI really worried about where we are and the thought processes of some of our people who have found individual success what they're thinking and [noise]\nUm I don't think they're thinking about our rights as a whole thinking about themselves as individual since they are accomplishments but I'm thinking about\nIt was that it came out in the paper that protest the description came out in the paper on the twenty second uh February this was the twenty third when I was engaged in Milton and there were ... And Julian I didn't remember Joe appears at the time I was there\nBut I was there see anything ah with anger I was a\nVery much a unhappy about being back in Atlanta because I had been in Paris\nThe previous year as I'm Merrill scholar and I had no real freedom [laughter] and I felt that I had been reached shackled I\nBeen constrained again you know everything that I had experience the year before was gone and it just disappeared and so I was there a main moaning my fate and a\nLot of came over and um it might have been Julian they both came by one of them said have you heard about the grains of our for and I said yes I've heard about the men so ah [noise]\nI think we need to do a similar kind of activities have ... we need to join them and they were on a ... Oh yes [laughter] I was I was more on board than anybody\n[laughter] did you let me ask you a question when you first heard about this organ at organizing and with the Atlanta student movement based on what was happening in Greensboro what were your thoughts\nAbout his my thoughts well I was a I was a\nAnxious to produce something because I because of of my experience a growing up and solve it or reject the segregated or environment or coming to Atlanta\nAnd face and a former segregation that I never faced before I mean I I I I I was confronted with the with the brutality of segregation in Atlanta knocked her liver and Alabama\nWhich was more segregated than you could imagine a but an divert Alabama kind of knew my place so we didn't we could have avoided we didn't we didn't confronted but in Atlanta uh\nI confronted and it wasn't a pretty sight the second thing is is falling under the spell of Dr Benjamin ... who's a a\nR came to appreciate for our laws as a as an individual as a matter of documentaries are\nBelieved that his first obligation to students at Morehouse\nWas to the program us too and to convince us that we were some butter\nAnd that was another thing that we couldn't do if we are part of cells\nAnd so are are are are just I just loved Dr berries are embraced his message and I just didn't know what to do and when the when the notion of of of margarine an activity in Atlanta after the after the uh\nThe situation in Greensboro was put on the table\nOr it clicked in my mind that this this might work\nI knew that that we couldn't we couldn't survive ... or in a violent confrontation represented redemption is a but but we perhaps had a chance if we approach to the way it was being proposed\nMisdemeanor Brooklyn the ashes did you tell your parents you were a part of the Atlanta student movement or you were going to be a part of it let us to ... not [laughter]\nI tell you my mother paid me the greatest compliment what she told me I called it from the jail 'til I was in jail she said oh I knew you were in jail before I got the call [noise] uh I was not a part of the initial planning group a diet lived like Mars Senate Lana [noise]\nAll of my life and even in Chattanooga, Tennessee where I'm from\nI'm among with segregation I mean that was all I knew and I despised it and any opportunity to do anything to move forward and away from that I wanted to be a part of that I understood\nI'm I recall I understood why the president of the colleges stood\nUm their job was to educate the students who enrolled according to prescribe curriculum this was not part of that curriculum but we had that was no protests one\nOne for ya oh no let me tell you that that was a a a little cold we had we didn't trust anybody we said over the age of thirty [laughter]\nSo I it's amazing now that I look at myself I said I've become the people we didn't trust because we felt they had too much to lose their jobs their positions that that worked hard to earn\nAt but they were the first people behind us to support us once we move forward and I think we knew they would be there so when I was asked after the initial planners Roslyn\nLoni Charles black Julian everybody got together to start planning when I was asked to to perform a task gets the girl the girls the young ladies that Spelman we now call in\nTo help us because we need needed numbers I didn't hesitate of course I was going to do I didn't know the plan because uh\nThe planners were very smart they couldn't tell us everything because they didn't want anybody to find out exactly what we were going to do all I was told was get some people to meet us over a lot of university\nI'm In a particular area at a certain time on the next day and that's what we had and we trust that that we were going to move forward to do something\nMuch back on the issue is ... did you have fellow students they were concerned that said you know look you know maybe maybe now it's not the time you know what was the tone throughout the sea\nFloor you had various out of Jews are students morals as well as the center in general were from all over the country and we also have some African students than that for other places um the predominant attitude that those who\nNot participate was um like on the part of the athletes the big bad football players\nLarger and do that goes I don't know what am I ... well we know where they will do it on the one that was it was a lot of bluster or for their ... with us in my opinion but the others were concerned about their parents losing their jobs if they lived in Atlanta\nUm because that could happen you know for news at a\nUh your your dad or mom worked for whomever or they give them fired [laughter] um but those votes from other places didn't have that concern because I'm from Miami\nFound a good from our parents so I I don't care about being exposed or getting arrested or getting a risk well you know interestingly I had the exact same experience the granted I call my mother from jail\nAs you said exactly the same thing that her mother says [laughter] for that but I read or heard about that on TV I I was at a ...
