Georgia\nI Wonder is declaring a state of emergency for more than two thirds of that state as Asia among burns report some W. A. B. E. N. Atlanta hurricane Michael had Georgia harder than officials originally anticipated\nGovernor Nathan Deal says the storm is unlike any this state has ever seen\nWe're not accustomed to the magnitude of the hurricane such as this getting in the direction that it is traveling and with the intensity with which it will hit our state\nThat intensity prompted jailed for class the federal government issue a declaration of emergency federal funds would help pay for some preparation and clean up for NPR News I'm ... in Atlanta\nMeanwhile the Florida Panhandle war Michael roared ashore earlier today as a strong category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile an hour wind gusts damages appear to be extensive in Panama City trees are operated in power lines are down some homes either had their roofs torn off or split in two by falling trees\nRun ... with the American Red Cross and says they're expecting many more people to wind up in shelters and the difficult twenty four hours for search and rescue teams\nWe know that people did not evacuated so what that tells us is we have a pretty good sense of our first responders are going to be required to perform surgery rescue overflowed\nOfficials say one man was killed by a fall and tree in the panhandle area nearly two hundred thousand customers in Florida alone are without power after the storm which is also cost extensive flooding\nChief justice John Roberts has referred to another circuit court Fifteen judicial misconduct complaints filed a recently against Brett cabin on the D.C court of appeals or Kavanaugh served until this past weekend and bears made it Totenberg reports the complaints all stemmed from Kavanaugh's testimony during his confirmation hearings\nThat complaints filed in the DC circuit in September in early October when Kavanaugh was still a judge on that circuit the to complaints that have been made public were brought by the Democratic coalition a political action committee and Washington the charges are the cabinet lied and violated judicial ethics rules against partisanship\nJust who filed the remaining Thirteen complains has not been disclosed about the D.C court kicked the allegations up to chief justice Roberts for referral to another ...

NPR stations other contributors include that John D and Catherine the MacArthur Foundation recognizing exceptionally creative individuals' this year's MacArthur fellows and more information alright max bounds dot org and the listeners who support this NPR station\nYou'll listening to a broadcast from earlier today [noise]\nLook into this Wednesday edition of closer look I'm Rose Scott and we'll begin with this which is the weather hurricane Michael has been upgraded to a category ... storm with potential wins of\nGet this one hundred and forty five miles per hour now that's according to the national Hurricane Center which also noted\nThat it would be the first category ... storm to hit the Florida Panhandle since records were first kept in Eighteen fifty one now as hurricane Michael makes landfall in Florida Georgia officials are paying close attention to the potential impact right here in our state but as for the Atlantic council theme is a meteorologist with the national weather service\nExpecting most of the impacts that column somewhere between about six PM the six AM Thursday morning\nRight now we are expecting some when gas to get up to about thirty to thirty five miles per hour your expectations about one to three inches of rainfall for the region as well\nAnd there is a very very slight tornado risk although it is mostly towards the south and east of Atlanta region but it's possible we couldn't get 'em out one or two tornados up around that area\nYesterday Georgia governor Nathan Deal did declare a state of emergency for Ninety two counties throughout south Georgia but that has changed within the last hour and while visiting the state operations center at the Georgia emergency management agency or Jima governor deal made this announcement\nJudge Kavanaugh says not confirmed and put through you can see a tremendous drop in morale on the Republican side ah this was a huge momentum ... ah for Republicans this was going to get them to the polls and eventually ah keep the housekeeper said\nBut did did it entered justice\nEnergized your particular demographic if they were talking about in terms of millennials\nI Would say most definitely um you know seeing are seeing our values\nAre being a protected seeing what we care for being protected seeing the rule of law actually are being applied fairly uh you know in this country we believe that you know and it's and it's been proven guilty\nUm there there were no facts ... cooperating and it's just for a ... um there were there was never in a moment\nUm during these seven FBI investigation that he went through um that suggested that there were any wrongdoing on his part so the the rule of law the innocent until proven guilty um and just finally Republicans getting a\nBackbone um is really something that\nMy generation as excited about\nJake what do you think [noise] yeah um I I think there is no doubt that right now are we we do have a very polarized electorate a from a political standpoint I mean I just I don't think anyone can deny that a ... a bit of reassurance in my opinion in this kind of\nGoes from the initial video we had already had older people are speaking as millennials are the most diverse generation American history\nAnd I said this very frequently were were a generation that\nHas been exposed to people that look different than us from people that are different backgrounds and we are and and I agree with a Porsche were were more tolerant or two people that are that are different and I think hopefully long term\nThat makes the discourse be different than it currently is and to me that's not a political issue I I don't think that it's a political issue to say that we shouldn't find middle middle ground we shouldn't have discussions like this ... with people who\nDon't agree with us on every political issue but at the end of the day I think that's going to\nBreak down differences because this is most important to note all humans have far more similarities and differences and if they come to the table and talked about issues\nI think that they will reach the best conclusion long term you think about the current temperature political temperature of the nation\nOr not to return to a couple of things that were the ... already I think I'm back to porches point I think was very um specifically with elation to to the cabinet nomination but also to um a lot of the big trends in politics right now both the national um and then down onto the the state and local levels which are that the cabinet\nNominations brought up a particular issue Brett Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by by three different women um as long as I said this he was nominated by President Trump who has been accused of sexual assault ... sixteen Eighteen when something like that um these things didn't happen in isolation this was not a new\nIssue for us so since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke um I think with last year and there have been many many I'm willing to move right but I mean to move many times up and all that right um so these things are happening in a ... a portion that we're becoming less tolerant of things like this remains as we built\nA certain amount of political momentum a certain amount of political force and awareness around these issues um which as many people have noted um have for very long time gone unaddressed I'm In politics and I think that's another\nWay in which millennial voters are\nIncreasing in their engagement they're seeing things that we're we're the status quo I think we're a lot of millennials that these are things that can't be changed this was just the way the world is\nAnd I we have these moments not just me too but black lives matter by a lot of other a vote of other groups that are now finding their voice and finding their power um who are who are making real change and I think that's that's the thing that's the\nThing that's going to spare millennials into greater political engagement is seeing their voices be heard and seeing their ability to make change\nLet me say from an air because among your groups ... what what conversations are you all having you you're out you did encouraging people to register to vote if they haven't and asked him about what issues are important to them what do they tell you what do you hear [noise] well\nI think there is a I think it cuts into kind of two camps which also I'm as aware of an ... substance and procedure on the substance side we've got a lot of the the bread and butter issues I think there's a lot of\nOf for lack of a better political imagination\nThat has just come into our generation so things like expanding health care access okay which for for a long time a lot of the old guard for lack of a better term is telling us the advanced unrealistic that can't happen\nYou know it would be impossible for every single person in the country to have health care and I think we're kind of fed up and are saying no you know what we can okay I'm a so that's one big issue but there's there's you know plenty and brought more but you hear and health care health care is definitely a big one especially because we have that policy fight earlier and then on the what I call the procedural side we have\nUm the current administration has fostered a culture of corruption I think his entire a significant portion of his cabinet as\nIs resigned in disgrace over you know from low level the high level graft and corruption and problems like that um and it goes all the way up in New York Times just\nAllege that President Trump had had committed in his career hundreds of literally hundreds of millions of dollars worth of my ex from his father right with money from his father and then through outright fraud and so I think people are concerned about that very deeply as well\nWhat issues what are you talking about the economy\nI mean it it is a young person\nOr when you're graduating from college or you want a job and unfortunately and environment you have now it's very difficult um to food the student loan debt situation is very difficult to timely pay off then dead and so ah the the reality is for young people\nThey want the ability to ensure that their education their hard work their training comes in materialize as an opportunity to get a job and I think if you look at the numbers there's no doubt about the fact that the economy is in a status I'm really of a Supreme growth unemployment\nRate is is is that all time low stock markets at all time highs and that's due to fiscal conservatism principles less government\nLess regulation um creating an economic system which rewards hard work creativity or all of which\nAre the this country was founded upon and all of which separate the United states of America from every other country in the world um and so maintaining that velocity because at the end of the day\nIn and one thing about politics is\nThe analysts can break it down you know six ways to Sunday but at the end of the day most voters look at ... am I better off today than I was yesterday\n... with people that have three kids that are making a household income uh fifty thousand or under they are concerned about the bottom line and so when they get to the ballot box despite you know all of the rhetoric that\nIn my opinion it if you look at the voting trends is what's going to control and I think millennials are no different run or do you think what do you what are you are talking about this\nI Would have to agree with a joke on um on many topics or the economy is definitely one of them you know and and no one's concerned about justice Kavanaugh for Trump if they don't have a job or they're worried about paying bills bills um and then for millennials in particular when I graduated college the first thing I thought about what the job\nOf uh before I graduate college the first thing I thought I was a job um and so I go to college to get a better job um and so I don't want free education\nI Want better economic opportunity or that I can apply my degree to 'em and then when I get that job I Want to make sure that I'm not paying higher taxes so we're talking about taxes from about the economy we're talking about building wealth\nWe're talking about establishing a community that fosters a healthy lifestyle um and just really the issues that matter to everyday people that do they do not watch Fox News or CNN [noise]\nFortunately the what are the issues you're only talking\nAbout um a lot of the same um but uh my friends are not consistently talk about a lot of the social issues and concerns that we have as well um my friends run the gamut from literally every social socio economic background you can think of um and we are very concerned about each other and for our families and for our friends and for our\nNieces and nephews 'cause none of us have kitchen because ... broke some [laughter] and about what kind of world we're leaving for um the people who are looking up to us um and how these elections are impacting am an example those social issues we were talking about sure um so I have\nFriends that I and as you can take your community and they're concerned about how they're treated when they step out on the street every day and how maybe they are um nieces and nephews or future children will be treated if there was a beauty cue when they're in schools were concerned about whether or not\nUm our I'm younger counterparts are going to be looking at um\nEven higher student debt than we have if they're going to be able to get a great enough education\nTo even be able to get into these institutions of higher learning um what are they learning while they're in school it's it's very much an ongoing conversation about what our young people are people who are younger than us than these ... will be I'm left with when we are going\nWell let's talk about the engagement process in terms of your group being engaged in the larger picture I mean you all are from the Atlanta young Republicans and the young Democrats of Atlanta is your voice being hurt within the group respectively the political parties as a whole and if not\nThe man of the year apparently president of the American and again we are working to get other voices from different political viewpoints on this program as well so stay tuned thank you for coming in and taking the time frankly but that slogan on a T shirt\nI'm telling you I was going to make it on the horizon thank you [noise]\nBiggest issue I guess for me is gun laws are the two or three year olds\nThat will be entering school at some point\nIt's just the fear of\nOf guns and what's happened in our past so that's that would be the most important issue to me\nMost late for me and protecting Planned Parenthood and women's rights\nConservative spending who's going to\nHave Washington ... spend less money at a federal level but probably spends a little bit more money locally someone who\nI feel is more\nIn tune with those of us that are in the middle versus extreme right or left\nSo that concerns me a lot they were getting so does this of this country and I think there's a lot of us that feel so concerned that one was in one direction or the other and shouldn't be that way 'cause I think the majority of us are silent\n... therapies intuition or working class important to me you are\nThe most part I mean we live in the southwest would lead to neighborhood I'm Lucy to neighborhood is changing and we're not going to use the word or however it's happening\nI guess one of the main issues is like urban development and transportation but also like not leaving people behind in that process as seems to happen in general the the develops like the ... people get left behind so mainly Atlanta based issues because that's just where I live\nBut also the rest of the state needs to be taken care of his stances on\nImmigration and how they view it in the states especially with things like the previous detention centers like ones that are in Georgia in Lincoln county I Know there's a big when there is kind of how to handle that\nAnd it definitely has the environment and I think that makes impact about what kind of citizens about restrictions on emissions and I say Georgia and that's what I've been thinking about\nIn it that or here's a look some upcoming events [noise]\nThis weekend is Atlanta Pride joined in the festivities which include marches parades live entertainment in ...\nIn Alpharetta this weekend wire in

N. land a choice for NPR is always I'm Rose Scott developing the Gulch it say five billion dollar project with the one point seven five billion coming from\nFinancing the California based developer the C. I. M. group is looking to build mix used retail and commercial dwellings and depending on who you ask the answers will vary regarding does the public cost outweigh the public benefit\nThat we've been talking about but now into the importance of money from tax allocation districts are attached so in a nutshell\nA tad allowed the percentage of property taxes over specific amount of time to go towards projects for specific area it's pretty pretty simple here's a little history lesson there are tend to add to the city of Atlanta and counties also in the mix a PS participates in five of those tests we'll get to that moment\nWhich means that ... a district agrees to forego some of its money from property taxes to fund set project everybody followed me okay now\nEnter a P. S. and the ghost development deal which will require funding for maybe as his property taxes because adults will be develop inside the west side tad joining me in Studio now to offer the school districts concerns is APO superintendent Dr ... thank you for coming into the time\nThank you so much for give us an opportunity to educate our community about the ... and the effect on the school district\nLet's start from the beginning and work for it because he's a correct today PS is currently participating in the five times I mentioned that is true okay now I Know due to market activity the amount of money kicked in on an annual basis that changes right\nIt does it does but um since Nineteen Ninety nine when the tad started we put in about four hundred and thirty four million dollars and the five cats in which we participate they say that number again four hundred and thirty four million dollars since Nineteen Ninety nine since Nineteen Ninety nine of course none of the tests have closed so we still have more to\nPay well we'll get to the moment because I think what's important for our listeners to know that does the district actually get to recoup any of the money paid until the attack\nA very little uh the the concept is that the tides actually have to finish being developed and then once they're closed the concept is that then\nI'm you're able to actually generate taxes that would allow for you to start making it back but as you can imagine you would it would take a couple of like a decade or so to be able to finally make yourself whole again and then really start benefiting\nI've heard the counter argument or opposition to that well you're not really missing any money technically I've heard people say that your what's your response\nUm that isn't true of course uh the state doesn't see it that way we lose about sixteen million dollars and our local fair share and that's an immediate loss once the developments actually start happening on one of these tad geographic sites\nSo the way the state sees a our school district and the tag is that you chose to be in them but they withhold five Neal's\nUm of what we could earn because\nThey you know believe that you made a different decision in your community but you are just going to have to ... they're going to withhold the money that would otherwise be coming to the system\nNow let's be fair because obviously the the a PS agreeing to participate in the tax happened before you\nLong before you came on board correct so one would my aunt asked this question okay well is there somewhere in the contract for the district can ask that either we pay off the debt paid off are you close it if you feel like development has reached its peak for that said area for example let's look at Atlantic Station exactly\nExactly so um Atlantic Station is a perfect example it was an industrial waste land by most people's standards\nUm and so if it weren't they could they call it a buck for test\nAh it would not be developed but for the designation of a tad and actually for what it's worth we support cleaning up blighted underdeveloped\nI'm depressed areas of our city\nThe challenges that what you're supposed to be doing with all the new revenue coming in to that tattoo is paying off the debt or the bonds inside the tag that hasn't been happening and because of that\nThings then start triggering like you'll extend the tab longer which means you're in it longer which means it will be a longer time period before you start seeing the benefit of what the spirit of attach should've been doing from the beginning\nAnd let's be fair to because we can also\nPoint to something that's happened now I'm just here but across the nation to ten years ago which was the great recession when what nobody building anything right so right at vets and unforeseen unforeseen circumstances\nBut everyone knows and economy isn't strong forever so you can always in terms of pay a certain time period you're going to see some type of recession\nNow let's get to this go to deal because there's a lot here to unpack when did the district first learned over this deal involving a C I Am group to develop the Gulch in wanting a PS two from what I understand to extend the west side was that part of the initial\nI Want to be clear like when when we were looking at all things a PS everything that we had inherited back in December\nBoy I stay safe we wish your uh area all the best\nThank you so much thanks for thinking about frankly county in North of here too but it's not just right here on the coast

Scott king and Shirley Franklin they have been trail blazers so they made it a little bit easier for us and they said okay we've we've opened the door now it's time for you to go in you know I Know where do you think\nOf course it's always very emotional to hear those speeches um dislike goes right to my heart [noise]\nWe saying on these women shoulders but I Would I look at now all of these amazing black women running for office who also stand on their shoulders and were encouraged by them you know had it not been for them just ... they would not be here now [noise]\nYou know I asked Shirley Franklin and conversation to tell me something collective about you all and when you asked shrug frankly I Know rents are so I got to get the quote right but here's what she said and I'm quoting here glory glory finally the sisters who've devoted their skill and talent to progressive politics\nBy organizing and leading in political issue debates campaigns and fund raising are telling their story\nFor all to learn they are preeminent leaders among national political leaders who have guided generations of successful political careers and aspiring leaders she goes on to say\nThank you for your support my campaign back in two thousand and one\nAnd for all support that through politics and made the world a better place for all people welcome and thank you surely Clark Franklin so you will now are part of\nThat group I don't know if you like the word legends maybe trailblazers\nPowerful women in politics and when you hear that from someone like Shirley Franklin does it count it also gives you hope about the future in terms of our future leaders\n[noise] I\nI think you know when I when I was listening to her prophetic words I was like who is she really talking about because you you'd hate to put yourself transport yourself into that but I can also say because of her leadership we can transport ourselves into that\nBut I think what she's also saying is you know you're in the door you know she still works I mean I I've I've ... I've been on the phone with Shirley for the last two weeks she still work and she's still in the vineyards so I don't think you have an opportunity to rest on your laurels just yet so while we might be getting a few accolades right now\nYou know I think we still have to work to do those ... now\nYou know I when I hear those words I I think about the\nThe election victory uh we saw at the end of last year my beloved hometown of New Orleans we elected our first African American female mayor\nWe can all play a role and keeping it together I just probably have\nI Would like to think less idiosyncrasies I'm they think I'm a coup by yeah they do look at his face they could buy a yacht because I like to you know we all get along I'm less how I get out yes they can't stand in line to face it you can't stand it and so I left that bother\nSome just don't bother me she's got more patients to listen to every bodies Taylor well actually then the rest of us She's that on the yeah I\nKnow I'm like get to the chase what's your problem let's figure it out okay we done by ... get out\nHere that honestly [laughter] and I'm like okay like the guy she adopted everybody yet if there's something wrong with that area bird upheld and when she has to stations a\nJob and I'm I'm more like let's get it done or we need to find any [laughter] ah I'm ready to get to work them but at five o'clock so [laughter] five o'clock\nIn the trade off because men young keeps open the door\nAnd so everybody goes into her office right with the Taylor well or they don't have a tail or they just sit and they want to chit chat and all that but then they go home at six o'clock she at work till midnight doing her work yeah and I'm like put those people out your office so or or make to make appointments so you can go\nTo a reasonable hour I mean you can get from what I\nDo you stand and yeah and if they would say if you look good donor\nGod Bless her go we go on a cruise with us last year she went chicken and screen before he went on a cruise through the area of history\nI didn't go kicking and screaming they just didn't know so it's going to show\nI think we got there first people would take in bed [laughter] for the whole summer weather man yeah I was going to show up at the dock [laughter] and I kept saying she's come and I believe in a lot of\nShowing up on the line and all of our time to call me a week before you show she's [laughter] that accompany the thing is paid for look I didn't write it was not true in a way of the money\nThere is the fifth member here that I Want to give you all an opportunity to to recognize an editor on into chambers is also very important to bring in all this together down\nWell Veronica is a a best selling a rider Afro Latina\nOr she was born in Panama and we want to somebody who could capture our ... our unique voices and help us write a story\nAnd with four women who have well let's just say our schedules are often out a lot she was able to not just interview was talk to us meet with us have dinner with us a and capture all of our unique stories I have\nTo say we did a lot of the writing too but without Veronica we probably would not have had a great editor and somebody who get a\nLet's just say smooth out some of those edges at least I knew I had edges\n[laughter] yeah she really she really did she get she really got us in a in a way that nobody else did and she was able to take the for voices and make it into one cohesive force\nAnd it tells the story and yell flow through in and out but if you keep the reader engaged I won't give too much away but you keep the reader engaged and were able to hear those distinctive voices ...\nSomething that caught me and and full disclosure this kind of kind of a war I I've stopped because I'm not finished with the book but politics may be the through line but friendship is at the heart of our story this book is what tells you a political stories it is about sisterhood mhm and and friendship\nAnd then are you able to still continue that and have that ... ... through and through a industry a world like the political landscape\nFor me you know I've actually found it quite\nEasy to have ... this collection of women as friends and\nYou know I think one of the things that you've probably noticed in the book is that we're all very different we have different personalities we you know we lean on each other and very different ways but the real to me I think what really shows us together as we have a fundamental\nThurston thirst for justice we have a fundamental thirst for fairness I think our value systems are collectively a line\nAnd I don't think that you know at least I have not you know I don't think we've had that experience where you know Dina's chair today you know I mean you guys at the White House tomorrow at least CEO\nLongest running you know the world\nI think what we have learned to do is to put all of our eagles aside for what ever we need for each other and that's the beauty to me of being a sisterhood is not about who's up who's down who's in who's out this about can you be there what whether it's good or bad [noise]\nBut they also you know for me or the friendship is I think of it as a well\nThat you that you can continue to go to for refreshing for reviving a and because we share a value system than be share\nOf political philosophy those are not things we have to debate or wonder about so that is sort of a foundation for us and so you can go on and do the\nYou figure out how are you going to strategize about this data and the third or you can just be crazy when we went to Donald sophomore Christmas rearrange the living room furniture and it was just slightly off center said boy you're going to have dinner or whatever\nBecause you know it's a basic things are being girlfriends are because we don't have to debate you know whether we are engaged enough in the community or or whether this cat we we have agreement on the on the basic that's a given that the given but you knew that down as Ottoman needs to be somewhere else in the living\nRoom yeah we ... we were all her house for Christmas did what it was more about the tree and it was their lives and not just\nQuite right but once you move the tree didn't that make the chairs weren't right away it's really weird and we had to move to chairs and that meant the couch was in the wrong position reiterated her home in bed away we finished it was on her way into it is still the same way [laughter]\nAnd I am afraid to move [laughter]\nUm and I look forward to putting another tree out another right position [laughter] you know come on up\nBut you know it's you know Washington DC is is not for the faint hearted I mean and being involved in politics at the highest level in American government it's not easy and the fact that we've been able to not just survive but thrive\nUh we've been through so many cycles a we've seen so much progress um but beyond our political lives there is you know our personal lives\nAnd I can personally attest to the fact that they've had my back uh I I describe in the book when my dad was I'm making this final stretch\nAnd how important it was to have Leah there to pray with my family\nUh and of course when my family um had to move out and were evacuated and needed to go back home in yawn helped to organize\nPeople to to suppliers wood furniture and clothing et cetera I tell people that my niece still where her designer jeans from a Yolanda that I go oh this you can take\nIt [laughter] don't worry I won't even try but because we're friends and not just a a not just\nPolitical strategist a political analysts we we've been able to go through the rough and tumble um I Know when you land a lost her son how emotional it was for her to lose her baby and we wanted to be there for her she's always cooked for us we want to stir the pot for her so\nUm this is a story about struggles or try to but more importantly it's just stories last year about values\nWho should read this book everybody everybody everybody's black white blame\nIncluding some men who might learn a few things from our women\nMhm [noise] I think that's a good way to end this conversation in the book is called for colored girls who have considered politics down to Brazil you land to carry away the river ... also with Ronnie chambers\nThank you and your other like thank you thank you conversations that's what you hear on closer look trusting them seeing yes we have a lot of them and the support that people give to
