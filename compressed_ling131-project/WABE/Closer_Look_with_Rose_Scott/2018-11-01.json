more than two years Kudo futures fell more than one percent today and they got sixty five thirty one a barrel in\nAnd the judge you also had some very strong opinions and how she sided with the plaintiffs in the defense and we should note let me ask you is that should brand campaign resigned from the office once he became the Republican candidate for governor would you advise him that if you were the AG\nI Would have it is within his discretion\nSo legally you know he can and and he's he's not a ... you know a he's within his rights to have stayed on we have examples in Georgia secretary of state saying on some resigning but I think he should of I think it would have been better for him to not that he needs my advice on that to take yourself out\nOf all of this you know I mean at least the impression that you are both the umpire and a participant on the field is not a good impression to have even even if you want to say okay there's nothing to various going on so\nI Would advise as the lawyer yeah it's in your best interest in in the states best interest for you to remove yourself from it so there aren't any questions\nLet's go back to the duties of the AG because you have been on record as saying that you charge that the turns you know Chris cars not you know been a litigator you're not you know try to get a prosecutor didn't want to be clear to because they're not uncommon that you know they ... they had was just an eighties and and also do you want\nWhat Chris car do I want you don't want anybody up against Florida in water wars you probably want somebody who's a especially litigator net so is that a little bit unfair and misleading when you say that he's not fit to be attorney general because of that of his background not having prosecuted anyone fair but it's\nIt couldn't be more fair and I'll tell you two reasons why I'm so not only is he never prosecuted case you've never tried case is never argued emotion in front of a judge yet and price law and Seventeen years and his bar license was an active for nine years prior to being appointed okay that is akin to someone dangerous right down the road right\nSo we're going to say we're going to make the chief of surgery hospital somebody has never operated before\n... ... it's not a stress if it's not a stretch because you cannot possibly in any other field\nIn any other field you wouldn't make some money the head of a bank they've never done a deal but that's not uncommon in this world with with the state's attorney general that happens all around the nation you know I I it it is it is very uncommon and I would challenge anyone to find any attorney general sitting right now\nIn terms of prosecuting ... as it relates to the duties of the age ... be the lead prosecutor being the person right there in the courtroom in front of the judge will read whatever you're saying that that typically it's the AG 'cause that's what I'm focusing on I mean\nThat's why I said there's two different things uh one one you can't leave people you can't manage attorneys if you've you can't manage litigators you can't manage prosecutors if you've never been one that's an absurdity that's like think about it this way are you saying Mr Paul Howard\nWood was the da ... and county would hire someone that's never prosecuted case to be his chief deputy\n... no one would ever do that okay so we say that's absurd do you think you know also the murderer Baker hostile or any of the\nFirms that operate midtown bucking downtown Atlanta would hire is a managing partner someone that it never argued emotion in front of a judge has zero litigation experience so if it's absurd for the law firms to do it\nAnd it sounds do it though in terms of when he was age eat the argue anything um after that the second point okay I'm Still on the first you can't you can't manage people if you've never done it\nBecause you you don't have any idea what you're managing\nAnd no other field would that be acceptable and it wouldn't be acceptable to farm it wouldn't be acceptable to da's office so why is it acceptable for the people of Georgia for the biggest from was except for the top prosecutor is not a simple for any other to the second point\nMy friend Andy Beshear is the attorney general Kentucky I had to have a I was having a nice to have a phone conversation with him a couple of weeks ago when we try to schedule phone conversation I could have it because you know where he was he was a court was standing in front of this\nSupreme Court of Kentucky arguing the position of the state of Kentucky Mike Bowers Republican has endorsed my opponent\nMike Bowers sit up in court on some of the most important things to that office he was able to do it here's the thing it's not that I have to be the the one in court and most of the time I wouldn't be the one\nBut you got to be able to do it if you can even if if if the attorney general is unable to do it because he's never but\nCan you ... can you can you fairly site where attorney general Kris cars not been able to manage\nHis his his assistance it can you give me an exam\nYes I can and this is because it is you're right it is more important than resume you know I've got a much better resume but this has real life consequences for the people of Georgia\nAnd I'll give you a couple of ways in which does um there's not one assistant attorney general working on organized crime right now there is not one assistant attorney general working on human trafficking now\nWhen our cars you you've you've hit a topic and I've covered this most of my career because I interviewed people in the ... office under deal ... who is on the government do who had been working on ... ... cases or you absolutely sure\nUnder Sam Owens there was a prosecutor there there is not an assistant a G ... there's not an assistant AG right now working on it let's talk about\nSex trafficking because that is an issue that both you all have talked about what what's not happening in Georgia and I've covered this Mr belly since two thousand Seventy thousand eight whatever I'm not sure any state has a ineffective initiative in terms of combating this throughout the state what George\nOf not doing that you think you could change well if from right right now at the state level we're nowhere in terms of prosecution so if you don't have anybody working on the issue you can't even possibly have a full scope of what you're dealing with\nOne thing about secular state prosecutions local yes I I Know of the Fulton County as and I think the cap county I came from Fulton County I Know the people that did it there no I I I'm Talking at a state level and to the thing is that duty doesn't live there's not one da or one chief of police or one share of\nThat can properly coordinating the entire state on this\nSo the fact that we don't have any assistant attorney general working on it working on organized crime and I'll say this any prosecutors or any person who stands up starts talking about human trafficking and they're not talking about organized crime\nThat's your first because they don't know what they're talking about you see it all being connected it is all connected it's organized crime syndicates that are doing the sex drive they're the ones doing our cottage trafficking\nAnd so the first thing we have to do\nThis one I'm going to build an organized crime and gang division in ages office which does not exist right now\nAnd then once we have that we got a ... by the organ out the top most violent organized crime syndicates that are operating in these spaces now\nBut it in Georgia part of not only statewide but some national task force and an interstate agencies that are working that have been working as it relates to sex trafficking as well as opioids which will get to in a moment show or you are you absolutely sure that in terms of that that the stages often not\nInvolved in in ... you're talking about someone who's prosecuting as opposed to initiatives to let's say exactly okay anybody can sign onto a task force I anybody can go to a meeting and it's not that I'm saying those aren't important\nI Know full well there are local prosecutors and their federal prosecutors in this state and out of the state that are working on this issue my point is there is no the only person\nThat state ... is the attorney general and he doesn't have any assistant agencies prosecutors working on prosecutors there's not been one prosecution out of the Asia is that the\nGenes phone or is it being able to work with where this the G PI or other state law enforcement because they have to catch these individuals or what role can the ages off as being in terms of capturing because you you wait for them to get captured first right correct\nWell it's manpower\nRight when you've got\n\nWhen you've got an issue like this\nYou've got that the when I was just said I'm going to build an organized crime and gang division for the first time one doesn't exist on opinion that's affect your your correct that are the fat doesn't exist this unit would be stopped with those investigators and prosecutors\nAnd these folks are the ones that you know these are long term investigations\nYou know which might called proactive as opposed to reactive investigations and so that is exactly what's supposed to be the role of the state's top prosecutor which is what the attorney general is supposed to be\nAnd so you would if not replacing was being done by the fed does not replacing was being done by local it is\nA state wide coordination of those efforts which is lacking\nAt the end of the day I can understand someone saying look the AG is the chief attorney for the state and also a legal legal advocate for consumers and we sort of touched on his earlier but when it comes to a conflict particularly based on a federal issue you know\nHow do you see the aging getting involved in this let's look at\nPartisan issues for example the Ford will CARE Act environmental issues\nHow do you know where what or let me ask you what are you using to assess when the state\nShould get involved in in a in a federal partisan issue I'm\nUh it's been at least about twenty million dollars is much is about forty million on land controversial per year for at least ten years that what we're saying that's exactly right so this is a portion of the existing sales and use tax on sporting goods equipment\nThat would be collected and allowed for use only four three purposes one is investing in large conservation Lance per the state's goals\nOne is parks and trails that can be a developed in partnership with local communities and the third is making sure that the properties that are already own or well managed okay so you mentioned investment you miss in parks and trilogy you talked about properly maintaining what's already out there how much money\nDo you all know goes into currently goes into would you want to call it land conservation Michael [noise]\nAnd it took it to be honest it's a very hard number to come to because it incorporates the buckets that I just laid out\nCan't count not only what gets spent to buy land for the state of Georgia but also what would I go into managing those lands\nAnd so year over year those numbers have varied over time\nWhich is one of the reasons why we know that by dedicating these funds\nWe can create consistency and having twenty million a year that can be spent such that we can plan better in advance for how to spend those funds so will this directly affect that nine percent figure that you through ... okay how because you'll be able to able to invest it in New lands that otherwise right now\nAre we not don't necessarily have the funds for cap plan ahead Michael\nHow's that trickle down to Atlanta I think it comes down to the issue that local governments and our groups like my own that helped to bring philanthropic resources of what we need\nLeverage and there's a number of different examples right here in Atlanta bind city park\nAre Kirk with urban forest a morning side nature preserve that were purchased with state lands are state funds and the state funds have been been layered on with our private sector dollars in money from the city to take those different opportunities and turn them into public accessible parks\nNow you all know when it comes to lots of money and who gets to manage it and who gets gets oversee it that is a valid concern when you're a taxpayer your voter so who's going to control these phones and decide how the money spent and you know some people they would the right to say you know what I don't look concerned where this twenty to forty million is going to\nGo and who decides who gets what and then later down and we hear Michael say well I didn't get my five million and then he ... he says what's up\nLet me start by saying that I think this is will be some of the best watched funds that exist in our state for any purpose\nSo you're looking at two hundred million over ten years that will have to be reviewed by a board of trustees that will be established per the legislation it will also have to be reviewed by the department of natural resources so they started Russia ... a new board would be a ...\nWho would appoint the members to that bores right so that is the U.S Senate and house but a point that the members of that board and it could be legislators it could be private folks from organizations are always going to be All right ... right now what we know is that it needs to be people with expertise in natural resources\nSo that includes the head of the department of natural resources\nAs well as the head of some of those sections under the department and will someone like maybe the capacity of Michael would he or she be able to possibly be a point to this ... absolutely because we see this now with the with the trend that poor people already upset about who's on the ball and he's on a board that's right\nYou can look at that as an example Michael with this ... what are you expecting whether you're on it or not but what would you expect this from this board it was as ...\nAs I see it I think that I'm a part of the public oversight and really the role there are six different organizations that came together I'm advocating for this and I don't think our job ends on election day so once this is past there is a rule making process that will have a public review process we will be engaged in that\nUh once the projects are um than solicited and selected there will be reporting on what actually where those dollars go and making sure that once those dollars go in those areas the investments in fact occurred and so the way that I see it this ... this um amendment has a ten year sunset\nAnd part of that is really making sure that it delivers as build or we really see this as an opportunity for leverage when we look across the country I think we've learned a lot in terms of the oversight and protection from other areas we've heard from other folks that ours\nHas among the strongest safeguards that people have seen and when I look at the different threats to our environment and our economy because of the um the the growth that we're seeing in that kind of thing I'm I'm very hopeful that we will see I'm an effort to make sure that we renewed this but\nA part of that whole oversight really comes back to those organizations to push for it to begin with but we will be the first to cry foul if we find that it's not going towards its intended purpose is\nIn there and let's look at another scenario here because if this does pass and you know also this is you know it depends on consumer habits as consumers by sporting goods equipment you know the market could change is there are you hopeful that\nThere is something that sort of a compromise because I can understand someone saying well look you know what that project that sells revenue is and what we thought it would be maybe there has to be some type of modification is this will this be built into that are you hopeful that they're saying there's flexibility\nBuilt into the legislation already and so right now our opportunity has to take advantage of a really strong consumer market and or your folks to go out and ask them to buy those things and you can count and knows they're going to go into the outdoor areas they love it's a it's a win win you said it's a win win or\nI'll add one other thing that I'm a you know another question that comes up in these types of things is what if we have an economic downturn and they're actually controls that are written into the legislation that actually kind of release the regulator in certain conditions to make it so that you free up the hands of government to respond to critical needs\nUm so again I think looking at the fact that we only had one legislator out of the entire house and Senate voted against says that there's overwhelming support from both a liberals and conservatives and everyone in between\nFor this and it's mainly because of the four thought that went into this this is really this election season and these amendments this has really been non political political issue with eight out of ten voters are when polled said they would vote\nYes he only had one state lawmaker that I think voted no incorrect raised concerns that you know perhaps you're taking money that could best be used for a different cause in the sets a valid point and and his peers decided that this was an amount of money that was actually not going to negatively impact other areas and was rightly step and conservation\nWhen we look at our parks in trails throughout the state of Georgia and you mentioned that as being one of the top three areas after investment and then also properly maintaining our parks in trails are they\nKnow Michael is while I'm Out in all the time and they are definitely not a mess they're beautiful incredible every one of the ... you want to make sure they maintain a and there's so much more opportunity I mean if if we wouldn't be at twenty seven billion dollars in consumer spending an outdoor recreation if people in Georgia I'm are taking advantage of these opportunities but there's more we can\nDo and along those lines I think it's just to put it in perspective we hear a lot about the movie industry here in Atlanta that's less than ten ... ten billion dollars in comparison to twenty seven billion\nOr for audio for recreation industry so there's just an simple economic terms it makes sense to support this the other thing that I bring up is I don't want people to vote for this because it's good to the environment or they care about the environment when you think about public health and having access to trails\nUm having great parks a local neighborhood parks as well as great state parks there's a certain there's a definite correlation in terms of childhood development the kids need active places to play every day and these funds will help to provide that\nAnd um it back to your question it you know the the state of not ... the state is um an embarrassment of riches in terms of the mountains and the coast in all the great things that make\nOur Georgia such an attractive place to live rails we want to keep it that way\nAll right Michael ...
