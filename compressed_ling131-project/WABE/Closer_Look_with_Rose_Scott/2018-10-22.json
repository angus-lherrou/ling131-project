Ginsberg urged ...\nHad knocked against for ... had had two children are older daughter Maryland who died um\nWhen she was six years old and\nRuth was to ... and so see a beta poured all this energy and intelligence in to uh the upbringing of this daughter and had a profound influence and you know like so many\nJewish families during that time there was all a lot of anti Semitic narrative and and actions that was common\n... do we know her parents taught as your caller Ruth about dealing with all of that in coping with the during that time do we have a sense of that\nOne of the things that her mother I emphasized a a great deal was the functionality of anger\nAnd I think I think that to come offline in minority families not just do a ... a mutt\nAs she can remember various incidents of you know being called ... and and driving in Pennsylvania with her family and passing signs at hotels that said no dogs are Jews allowed and\nSo she was keenly aware of anti Semitism and I think her\nHer mother's emphasis on how anger was not function all was partly in response to that and a lot of her influence how to do with um\nJewish religion and that is\nMaking her daughter understand what ... Mitt repairing the world making it a better place a more just place she also taught her the meaning of ... I say DACA ... which is sharing because Ruth had\nA birthday party every march\n[noise] but they never celebrated as did her classmate her mother took her a mother and her aunt took her to a Jewish offering an orphanage in Brooklyn the pride of Judea and um ice cream bars\nShe said later that you know she would have liked in ordinary birthday party like other girls and and her school but that it was such a joy it was so nice seeing the the joy and\nHappiness if the children that she\nCould appreciate why they wanted her to do that\nHow much access did you have to her one on one to Justice Ginsburg\nWhile I did a number of of interviews I think uh [noise] six before two thousand and six and then a three after that um\nWe stopped doing\nThe interviews the year she found out that her husband's cancer had return and then resumed later on\nShe very open to the idea of you I take it she was doing this biography of her\nWell it didn't start out as a biography at all I was interested in the ACLU litigation and I went to the archives at Princeton University the seating mud library which is depository of the ACLU are ...\nAnd um I was able to get the\nCase files for this read the read breach which was full of correspondence with Ruth and I was absolutely hooked and I said ... the rest of the uh women's rights project papers\nAnd they said we don't have them um and I said sure yes we're sure the the um FBI wanted them when she became when she was nominated to the Supreme Court\nFor background checks for background we we've heard that before lately everywhere and uh they\nSaid they must still be at New York so those are very frustrating period when I was trying to figure out what had happened disease and a colleague of mine said well why don't you write to Ginsberg\nAnd ask her to help you locate [noise] and\nI got ... this letters in my mailbox that left us women see these records which was written to the ACLU\nAnd it turned out they were lost in a move between buildings in New York at the national headquarters and she said well you know she was teaching it calling me at the time and she said you know I had a record in the fall cabinet at Columbia\nAnd uh You're welcome to look at those which she had transferred to the library of Congress men stripped division\nAnd so she was happy to talk about those\nUm and she had said to me let me know if you have any questions and then one fatal lay I called up and said ah the interviews will always it's a four o'clock on friday before Labor Day\nAt the court and they could extend longer than and a\nSaid I'd like to talk next time about Flatbush\n\nWhich way she had grown up in Brooklyn yeah and she said we don't need to talk about for like Bush [noise] um\nAnd I said well I think it's important because they're I've read articles in which the differing descriptions of cancer your mother had and I mentioned a couple of other contradictory\nThings that we're in for it and I said really I think it's important to know the facts to have the facts\nStraight so she agreed to give me half an hour and I get it at that point it tend to we were working so hard to get the facts straight that I write up what I had gotten a firm that half\nHour interview which I think stretched forty five minutes and then I send it to her you know after I had to type it up so the first chapter was by far the hardest\nTo do because it took me for ever to get all the material that was the first chapter\nYou mentioned that\nWhen you read it you thought hey this is this is pretty good this is already being touted as the most comprehensive\nAnd detailed\nAccount of Justice Ruth\nBader Ginsburg do you you see it\nThat way it's okay to sometimes they know what my work is this is the truth right here it's a life it's her life\nWell it is to the extent to the extent that I could get all the sources that are needed I mean you really never know I think when you write about another person's life\nThere always things that you don't know and when you interview a justice\nWho's a custom to control um\nI can remember I can remember asking a question and if she didn't want to answer she didn't inherit and I would come back next year and in the context of other questions asked the question again usually by the third time I could get an answer\n[noise] well the book is called\nRuth Bader Ginsburg a life the authors Jane sharing the heart professor of America and history at the University of California Santa Barbara ... being to on your speaking later the Atlanta history center thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed it\nWell thank you\nI mean there's nobody I'd rather talk about hobbies so I I ... and you got five hundred and forty pages to back it up too much thank you [noise]\n\nWe brought her north and they told us that uh she had maybe four months left to live and we should just take her back to Haiti and let her die there um and I knew her to be a fighter and I said I'm if she's going to fight I'm going to fight and she lived nearly two years twenty three months which is very very long with the PG\nUh which is always fatal and during that time she gave us the gift of a family and ah the probably the best little story I can tell you about her is when she got towards the end than she needed to be carried everywhere and I carried her wherever you know up from the table from the bed downstairs wherever she wanted to go\nAnd we were sitting at the table one time coloring and all of us I looked at my watch a ... it was late for work and I got upset I gotta\nGo chick I'm Sorry and she said no no stay in color I said I have to go no no stake she could this is my job and she said no it's not your job is carrying me you know like that and of course\nShe was right my job my real job was carrying her as all of our job is to carry children and and the last time I held she\nUh was one I carried her after she died a in our little bed in our in our room with my wife and me right next door and we we filter final heartbeat\nLiterally go out of her body and I carried her a outside to the you know to the Hearst was waiting so carrying her was a was an honor and uh\nI'm actually working on that book now that I intended to do and that's going to come out next year I Believe in it's probably best that I waited and got the fiction kind of put it in the motions into the next person you mean heaven but I'll tell her story one day\nI'm going to get back to the book but I Want to ask you ... did you talk to her about having\nYeah she talked about having a and of course she said well first she said\nHow did you find me remember that night distinctly she was lying there and we were just kind of voting on her she was in a bit out of the blue she said how did you find me I said what do you mean how do we find you how did you um is Janine find me and\nI said you mean how did you come to us at the mission\nAnd she kind of nodded but I realized\nTo her that's probably what it felt like because she didn't really remember her mother um and it felt like she was found like she had been lost somewhere and all she really remembered was life with us and so then we started talking about you know that you would see her mother again and housing and she said well how the how you're going to know me\nAnd I said oh she'll know you why she\nDidn't see me she doesn't see me now you know she was using a seven year olds logic and I said she knows who you are and and she'll see but we never really talked to her a lot about her illness you know we we weren't people who nicknamed her tumor to me the tumor or anything like that I I Want her to be a child as long as she could and that's what we did\nIt get back to\nThe next person you meet in heaven if folks haven't read the five people you meet in heaven can they follow\nYou yeah you have to always sort of prepare for an eddy makes a a return visit or in this but it's not a prerequisite for knowing this is the story of anti ... and anti or who is eight when the accident happened uh now is grown up and she doesn't remember the accident and she has sort of traumatic\nOr you know memory where it disappeared and all she knows is that that morning she went to the museum part and that night she came back\nAnd she was injured in the accident and everything changed and from that point forward she was kind of shadow by the idea that she makes mistakes\nAnd of course she did make a mistake that day but she doesn't know why and so everything then throughout her life as she takes that point of view high school as a bunch of mistakes and relationships bunch of mistakes and they've been trying to find a job mistakes and and she just thinks she's one of those people that everything she touches goes wrong\nAnd finally she marries her childhood sweetheart and she thinks finally I did one thing right and that turns tragically wrong on their on their wedding night and she dies trying to save her husband from a balloon accident which is similar again to like the big crash and the first book in the first chapter in and\nShe goes to heaven and she meets five people one of whom of course is Eddie\nAnd Eddie is the one who really finally it illuminates for her to know this wasn't a mistake and your life was in a series of mistakes even the thing that you did with me wasn't a mistake and he kind of shows or how it all fits into the bigger picture how long it take you to write this with ...\nYou're a little over a year year and a half\nIt was easy to find that voice again once I you know I was surprised has been Fifteen Years since I wrote in that voice it's sort of a a gentle narrators voice almost tell like telling a fable or and every book has its own voice so you have to ... that's really the trick to settle into that boys\nBut it really came back to a surprise you must authors and now I Know like what are you know the jak richer writers or Harry Potter or whatever the you know they just conjure up that oh here we go again and they bring the characters back and you can have that voice return to you\nKnow when people like they tell you and you say to just write your like come on\nWell the the biggest difference having been a journalist and being a novelist is when you're a journalist or you're writing you know a true story you say boy the story would be amazing if he had a brother you know but of course she didn't so we can't\nWhen you're a novelist you say boy this to be amazing if you had a brother and he said oh I can give him a brother that's the good part the bad part is\nMaybe I should give him a sister [laughter] yeah maybe I should give them two brothers your imagination never shuts off you can always imagine another way to phrase and another thing that could happen to your characters and so at some point you have to say no\nI'm telling this story the story doesn't mean that there weren't thirty other different versions believe me of the five people than any meets in in the next person mean heaven I had like six other people that kind of\nAlmost made the cut and then you know training camp ended and they had to go uh but you know I could imagine the book with a different thirty Eric Durban but you can't do that or you'll torture yourself you never write anything\nYou recently told the Associated Press and I'm quoting here I really don't think my books are about death and I don't think they are depressing I think the opposite and that was in a reference to people like in your teens to always deal with damage or the afterlife right right\nIt's more the death part of the afterlife I don't mind but uh it's ... to that question why are you still fascinated with death\nAnd I always laugh and I say I'm not that I hate death I Want to I don't want to come visit me I don't like writing about that to me if he writes serial killer books you've got something about that every ten pages you know someone gets their throat slash their head blown off you've got to really graphically describes it my books there's usually one death that usually takes about a half a page\nAnd the rest of it in life but what I learned from Tuesdays with more\nAnd I guess I employed and everything that I have written sense is that\nWhen death is a theme or an element of your book you can get people's attention about life the reason Tuesdays with more resonated with people in terms of the lessons that more he was saying are important was because he was dying\nAnd we believe that when people really are about to die there was a wisdom to comes that is different than the wisdom when we're just walking around perfectly healthy you're able to put everything into perspective and say this matters this doesn't matter you thought this matter but now you're at the end it doesn't\nSo in each of my novels there's usually a debt that also kind of gets you into that year like a white well but that that's happened and the nice things must have been important and I can talk about those themes\nLike in the first one that there is no such thing as a nobody and then he finds that out when at the end of his life in this book that there's no such thing as mistake after mistake after mistake that your mistakes open opportunities for you to do good\nWell yeah I could just write that but it's a bromide when you're right it it just sounds like a self help thing but when you write a story about somebody who died and die thinking that they were a mistake and then finds out that they weren't now it's a story with a lesson now it's a fable that's what a fable isn't so\nThat's the only reason that there's a death in my books it's ... to go\nOkay you got your attention now All right now we'll\nWe're going to talk about life so you're not Mitch out on the death writer no [laughter] I Do not wear a shroud I ah I don't live in a cemetery and I know I Hope to hype of the thumb blessed that I can live a long life and I want that for everybody around me do you read reviews of your books which\nLong ago gave up on that I understood I understand the review world and and uh\nYou know being a journalist I have had friends who have done reviews and all the rest and I know that also being a journalist is probably hard for other journalists to write about a journalist who's writing novels I think right off the bat you're you're almost got to strike against you but but I don't read good ones or bad ones and you know sometimes people come up and tell me about something\nThat I you know as if they thought I read it but for the most part\nI ah I very much I'm a writer who connect with those readers and I do read their letters and notes and that takes up all the available time I have because they're very passionate and frequently there about their own heartbreaks yeah and you can't just\nYou know I always said being a journalist yourself you appreciate this when I was a sports writer [noise]\nPeople would stop me an airport since I recognize me from the sports reporters TV show that I was on and and they what you know the guy beyond the moving sidewalk and they'd be on the movie\nAnd they say hey sports reporter is a a who's going to the super bowl and you'd go patriots and you just keep going\nThen after Tuesdays with Dorie and ever since then people will recognize me and they say hey I'm my mother just died from cancer and the last thing we did was read your book out loud together", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "22"}
