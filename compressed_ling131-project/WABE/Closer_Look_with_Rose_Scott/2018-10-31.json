I have to either be present the hurt 'em and those are the basic concepts of this you have a right to\nAlert the court that\nThe way I'm supposed to be treated as a victim as I go through this process has not been as the constitution says\nUm and so it it better allows for a in those hopefully rare instances where the prosecutors either for whatever reason the victim is not given\nNotice a and as you mentioned with regard to the the example of martial law are and what happened to their family or someone that the the criminal accused the perpetrator was let out on bail and the family was not notified um and that criminal accused currently you then went\nAnd murdered 'em their family member or and so what is contemplated than the men that ... that we have and what is a core concept of the ... law or constitutional\nAmendments across the state is that in the event that the system so to speak doesn't work like it's supposed to ... you have a vehicle to go to the court and asked the judge 'em to alert the judge that you're right hasn't been honored and give you that chance to be heard and then the court of course\nJudge a woods fashion whatever up a remedy that he or she is the judge thought was appropriate\nIf you're just joining me I'm joined by George the state's Republican Senator John F. Kennedy and we're talking about a minute for on the ballot it's coming up in the upcoming election is known as ... as long as I Want to talk about something that's called the opt in\nAnd and there have been a lot of folks that is kind of confused by that so the final version of martial law\nHas a coat opt in system what does that mean king's birthday down for me\n[noise] well um I guess rose give me a little more context on that that language is found in various circumstances can you\nPut something around that so many with that so the ... law which was approved by the house and Senate last march has an opt in system which victims must make known their interest in being informed about the details of a criminal case\nSo deadly ... for me which victims must make known their interest in being informed about the details of the criminal case one would think that they should if they're the victim or the other families victim that they so they have to opt in and make it known that they're interested in being informed about the details of a\nCriminal case it seems like they should be happening anyway is that not happening\nWell it it should um but let me tell you the the idea behind that and the driver\nI'm not withstanding what we talked about and and the really deep philosophical believe that victims ought to have the right to be heard\nThe important part they're roses they have the right to be or not that they are compelled to be heard or compelled to participate in a in a particular aspect of the criminal trial or the criminal process\nYou can think of circumstances very tragic circumstances where the victim of crime\nBay in fact not want to participate they may not want to either relive the event or for whatever reason and that ought to be that person's choice so that the opportunities that are being afforded hopefully Morsi's laws passed in the rights that will fast\nThrough our constitution with all of our citizens the right to be heard won't be turned around or turned on its head such that it would be a compulsion\nFor the victim to be involved I mean let's remember them the victim where the victim's family if they've been through a lot they've been through enough and what we want to do is make sure that to the extent they want to participate and to the extent they want to be heard\nThey ought to have that right but you wouldn't want to have the circumstances where they they were forced to does that make sense\nYes well I I on you you explain it\nUh let me ask you this because when I asked earlier about looking at other versions and there are other versions and other states but were you able to borrow any of those important I guess additions that you wanted here in Georgia even if it doesn't mirror inexact\nOr another state ... he's all but there was something you were able to extract from another state that you wanted to put in his ... did you put in the measure\nI'm sure I ... and I think ah for that matter really most of what you find in our version of it are found in most if\nNot all of the other state for concepts our number one that you have a right to be treated with dignity and respect something something we can all all agreed with number two that you have a right to be to to get a notice\nOf what's going on with your case a number three that you have a right to be heard again as we just spoke to with your great question about the often language that if you want to you have the right to be hurt\nAnd then finally the fourth element of it is simply that if in fact one of your rights\nAre not on or you're not allowed to participate or you weren't given notice you have a vehicle to file a motion with court and bring it to the court attention so that it's addressed timely rather than\nThe case continues on its normal course and then a sort of at the end of the day you're you're hurt from but it's it's too late or it's not timely with regard to what was going on with the prosecution of the accused\n[noise] you know when we look at the movement to past Marcy law across the\nIt is a well funded ventured that's for sure I'm a marsh his brother the Hindu Nicholas is is a billionaire and he spent I think about nearly nine million dollars in Georgia alone what does that say to you about what a lot of people you know the I guess the feelings or emotions behind making sure moss you've law gets passed me\nHave Kelsey grammar and sadly and tragically Kelsey grammar is speaking from experience so it's not like they're just using a celebrity but he's speaking from experience that tragic experiences\n[noise] um you know that's a great question and I think what it demonstrates is that people are people who they or their families are victimized by criminal um it is one of the most difficult things to go through\nIt is a difficult both in retrospect\nAnd uh you know one of the concerns is ah how do we help people move on from that\nAnd what you find is that uh it is difficult to move on if you're a victim of crime and so people that have been in that situation as you said Kelsey grammar speaks very eloquently and the commercial uh and the spot that he has\nA he has cut for for martial law and other people that have names are such as the family member or who has has funded this\nAnd the interesting thing a rose that I I Am very moved by as I was by many victims that came to the court house cues me to the capital [noise] uh when we were debating this bill and when we were seeking\nOther legislators to support it is um [noise] and I remember so many ... ladies wearing the the the shirts are supporting Morsi's law and one of the things that I said to my colleagues from the will of the Senate was the interesting thing about those people that are in the capital of the day\nIs they're not here asking anything from you all they want is sensible legislation so that\nWhat they have endured does it happen to someone else in Georgia\nAnd I think the same thing applies to the the the family that is funding this the same thing applies to people like Kelsey Grammer ah he's sharing his opinion and his experience not because he'll derive any benefit from it and he's not asking anyone anything for him\nWhat he hopes is and like I Hope and like the victims who have come out to support\nMarcy flaw is they hope that they are bad experience\nThe victim being sort of I guess kept up to speed on the on the case on the trial and I asked the senator this to me I think as a if you're a victim or you're the victim's family if you would assume that you're being kept abreast of\nThe alleged perpetrator is out on bail or or what have you that might be baffling to some people's thinking well that's already happening what do we need to add this to to a statute\nLaw and order for this to happen it should be up and it says the statute already coverage at the language in the statute says [noise]\nAh the victim has the right to reasonable accurate and timely notice of any actual course getting the right to reasonable accurate and timely notice of arrest release or escape of the accused the right not to be excluded from hearings and so forth all of those same provisions like that's all the statute\nAnd then you look at the constitutional language it has all of those same things but within addition in the constitution in order for the constitutional amendment the right in the ... and that meant to be triggered the victim has to request it\nSo the statutory language says you just have the right to be there and get the notice onto the constitutional provision you actually have to ask so you have to opt in in order to get that so talked about that in that regard of the constitutional phrasing this amendment of phrasing is narrower than what the statute already provides\nSo if there are victims in Georgia who have not received reasonable and timely notice of proceedings who have been kept out where they should have been included\nThat's not a failure of the formal law this statute it's a failure of of of um the way the system happens to be working in that particular jurisdiction and to correct that failure we don't need more formal law we need deeper attention and more resources to making the law we already have\nAffected [noise] you know something else at the center brought up in which was the first one it's a look you know just a respect that you as a victim or the victim's family you have a right to be respected now often we may see something like that in a resolution but we're talking about adding that to\n... you know said constitution of respect I mean everybody wants to be respected whether you're a victim of the victim's family adding that language to this some say it's kind of problematic\nUh well we already have that the statue to uh the last clause of the statute says the victim has the right to be treated fairly and with dignity by all criminal justice agencies so again I don't I don't think the language of the constitutional provision\nAds that dimension of respect I think that what the senator may have been alluding to is that by placing something in the constitution which is the the um the kind of at an elevated level above statutory schemes in our state\nUm that it's there is a symbolic effect that placing something in the constitution is has more groggy toss than simply placing something in a statute but in terms of the way a victim would experience it\nI'm In ... there in their daily travels through that that case I'm from police to prosecution to court so on\nUm the the constitutional provision will not actually give them any more than a statue does\nAnd you know critics of this not we're not just critics or the others will just looking at this from different viewpoints say well look you know let's talk about the what they say the criminal accused or the accused here because in other states they're big concern that Morsi's law could infringe on\nThe rights of the accused see that\nI I don't see it again is looking at just the Georgia statute has been in existence since about Nineteen Ninety six were were more than Twenty years in with a statue\nUm nothing in the statute nothing and the constitutional provision limits anything about the accused experience in the justice system play allowing the victim a right to be present in a right to be heard does ah only provides the victim of voice and I'm at an opportunity to meaningfully\nParticipate to the extent that he or she wants to but they're the victim has no ability to veto a plea bargain no ability to block a proposed continuance no ability to um circumvent what would otherwise be the the formal process\nAnd I'm Glad you brought that up because it was leading to my next question because this is more about the victims voice there's nothing in the minute that would force the courts to change a process or add steps in the operations of the process so that really is just about the voice for the victim or the victim's\nFriend it's again for victims who wants to opt in so I ... and the the provisions says the Georgia general assembly will have to craft some kind of process for victims to opt in\nUm something that would apply across the county's instead of um having a presumably if with Georgia has a hundred and fifty some odd counties we don't want to see a hundred and fifty different provisions we'd like to have one that has drafted by the general assembly that says hey it for a victim who wants to opt in\nThis is the way to do it but um but the victim doesn't have a right to steer things in any particular direction\nFor some issues have you looked at a martial law and other States I've looked at a very ... M Ms or state that has a version that you think is\nThat works or would maybe be your viewpoint but I mean 'cause there's so many different versions out here there are ... and\n... again to the first since ... about the mid nineties ... about thirty states have already had these kinds of provisions in their constitutions um the ones that didn't put it in the constitution had a statutory bill of rights so the landscape is already well traveled in terms of of recognizing the need to give victims of voice in the process [noise]\nUm I think that other states who have been part of the ... the ... um movements over the last couple of years\nHave provisions and their allies that Georgia has chosen not to include which I um and I think the provisions that Georgia has chosen not to include um they have done so wisely because those are the provisions that have triggered problem so for example in North Dakota their version includes a provision we don't have that says\nThe victim has the right to keep confidential any information that might be used to harass or locate her\nAnd that provision in North Dakota has been seized upon by some police officers who allege that they are victims in police officer involved crimes where they it's like a police officer involved shooting and there can be a lot of negative publicity and police officers can be harassed and that\nUse by police officers of that provision is regarded by some people as them hijacking a British and that was not drafted at all for that purpose but Georgia's doesn't include that I think it was very wise that that was left off the table\nWell from the viewpoint or anything if you think maybe should have been at it\n[noise] um [noise] I you know I it's hard for me to say I think in general these laws are\nUm they lack any kind of enforcement mechanism um and there's a reason for that um because constitutional rights in the criminal justice system belong to the defendant\nThe bill of rights both of the federal level and at the state level is meant to be a bulwark against overreaching by the government and it is meant to reflect a counter majority Harry in sentiment\nSo there's a reason the victim is not a party to the criminal case and that lawmakers have been extremely reluctant to allow the victim\nTo intervene in the case in the way we might see in a civil case there's you know two parties ... there's a civil lawsuit but there's another party that has a relevant stake in it we allow them to intervene we don't allow that here because the constitutional rights belong to the defendant alone because it just the defendant whose life liberty and property\nIs at stake if the prosecution go south I'm gonna ask\nYou same question I end up with the senator on and that's is because when we look at something like this and we look at hate crimes and laws there are federal protection is obviously put Georgia does not have a hate crime statute so someone lets them and say well what's the difference or why not why don't we have a state hate crime law\n... well I um let me answer one one corollary first which is ... ... is there not a federal victims bill of rights and that sort of general constitutional limit\nAnd twice in our history there has been momentum to make that happen in a in Nineteen eighty seven and again in Nineteen Ninety six Ninety seven it was something even that Bill Clinton endorsed at the time but the momentum never really got anywhere people realized it was\nUm [noise] I ... it was a lot of a it was too much symbolism and not enough pay off to put it in the federal bill of rights [noise]\nUm so but getting back to your point about ah I'm not the hate crime production we have fifty one distinct criminal justice system to the United states ... each state has its own and then there's the federal government\nThe federal criminal justice system is guided by a series of federal criminal statutes and those for imminent federal criminal statutes like a federal hate crime statute applied only in federal prosecution prosecution that looks like the United states against\nAgainst Mr X or y [noise] um we cannot use federal statutes for on local state prosecutors\nSo most crime it's happening at the state level and um we need as we need special reasons to make a crime federal that we have to um incorporate a federal interest somehow like if you shoot a federal corrections officer or listeners if you are driving while intoxicated and the ...\nA lot of the VA that the federal crime as compared to driving while intoxicated on Piedmont road which is a state crime\nSo the reason to have a state hate crime statute is because most instances of hate crimes are not intrinsically federal crimes and we would want to provide acknowledgement of the seriousness of that behavior for the citizens of Georgia\nUm and for George you to take a stand saying we have an interest in preventing and and um it discouraging and punishing crimes that are committed on the basis of biased against um somebody because of race or gender or religion or LDP status\nAnd when we visit that again will have you back I'd love to feed our\nDecay living associate dean of faculty professor of law in University School of law\nIs an example of anti Semitic messages and hate speech leading into a message of violent action screw your optics ongoing in leading into actual violent action one of the worst and I sent medic uh crimes in America's history so you know what do I make it a statement that gap has committed to being a platform of free speech well\nI think gab committed to being a platform for free hate speech\nAnd that's legal but it's also despicable\nAnd if other companies went to condemn and cut ties with a despicable platform for hate speech then they to enjoy that right under law will\nWe mentioned go daddy did cut ties are also pay pal medium stripe and joy ... have cut ties to the site since the shooting on Saturday but a message posted to

provider I I don't know of another domain provider that to date has said that they want to host gab maybe one will emerge from the woodwork um I'm uh\nFortunately rather sure that they'll find one but I don't know when that will happen is there any\nCriminal liability for a social media site or its founders if someone pose threats and then carries out an attack like this\nSo it's a matter of

on the other hand a book club for\nAnd ran lovers discuss the fountain headache can do that to a new social networks can be almost whatever they want to be and they're probably not\nCriminally liable for hate speech under current law\nBut even if they can't be criminally punished for hate speech they can be financially punished for hate speech people can say I don't want to go on to Twitter\nBecause all I Am assaulted by anti Semitic messages are assaulted by you know anti women messages and so Facebook and Twitter has taken pains are probably not done enough but they've started to try to crack down on hate speech on an end and bullying on their platforms and gap to be clear is an alternative\nUh to uh these efforts that that the Facebook and Twitter undertaken\n...

you were the AG\nI I Would have it is within his discretion\nSo legally you know he can and he's he's not a in a he's within his rights to have stayed on we have examples in Georgia secretary of state saying on some resigning but I think he should of I think it would have been better for him to not that he needs my advice on that to take yourself out\nOf all of this you know I mean at least the impression that you are both the umpire and a participant on the field is not a good impression to have even even if you want to say okay there's nothing to various going on so\nI Would advise as the lawyer yeah it's in your best interest in in the states best interest for you to remove yourself from it so there aren't any questions\nLet's go back to the duties of the AG because you have been on record as saying that you charge that the turns you know Chris cars and not you know middle litigator you're not you know try to get a prosecutor didn't want to be clear to because they're not uncommon that you know they ... they had was just an eighties and and also do you want\nWhat Chris car do I want you don't want anybody up against Florida an award or as you probably want somebody who's a especially litigator net so is that a little bit unfair and misleading when you say that he's not fit to be attorney general because of that of his background not having prosecuted anyone fair but\nBe more fair and I'll tell you two reasons why I'm so not only is you never prosecuted case you've never tried a case is never argued emotion in front of a judge yet and ... and Seventeen years and his bar license was an active for nine years prior to being appointed okay that is akin to someone dangerous right down the road right\nSo we're going to say we don't make the chief of surgery hospital somebody has never operated before ... ... it's not a stress if it's not a stretch because you cannot possibly in any other field\nIn any other field you wouldn't make some money the head of a bank there's never done a deal but that's not uncommon in this world with with the state's attorney general that happens all around the nation you know I it it is it is\nVery uncommon and I would challenge anyone to find any attorney general sitting right now in terms of\nProsecuting ... as it relates to the duties of the aging ... being the lead prosecutor being the person right there in the courtroom in front of the judge or jewelry or whatever you're saying that that typically it's the AG 'cause that's what I'm focusing on um I mean\nSo that's why I said there's two different things uh one one you can't leave people you can't manage attorneys if you've you can't manage litigators you can't manage prosecuted if you've never been one that's an absurdity that's like think about it this way are you saying Mr Paul how\nWould the d._a. fault and county would hire someone has never prosecuted case to be his chief deputy\n... no one would ever do that okay so we say that's absurd do you think you know also the murderer Baker hostile or any of the firms that operate midtown buck in downtown Atlanta\nWould hire is a managing partner someone that it never argued emotion in front of a judge has zero litigation experience so if it's absurd for the law firms to do it\nAnd it sounds do it though in terms of when he was age eat the argue anything um after that the second point okay I'm Still on the first you can't you can't manage people if you've never done it because you you don't have any idea what you're managing\nAnd no other field would that be acceptable and it wouldn't be acceptable to farm it wouldn't be acceptable to DA's office so why is it acceptable for the people of Georgia for the biggest from\nWas except for the top prosecutor is not as central for any other to the second point\nMy friend Andy Beshear is the attorney general Kentucky I had to have a I was having a nice to have a phone conversation with him a couple of weeks ago\nWhen we try to schedule phone conversation I could have it because you know where he was he was a court was standing in front of the Supreme Court of Kentucky are you in the position of the state of Kentucky Mike Bowers Republican has endorsed my opponent\nMike Bowers set up in court on some of the most important things to that office he was able to do it here's the thing it's not that I have to be the the one in court most of the time I wouldn't be the one\nBut you got to be able to do it if you can even if if if the attorney general is unable to do it because he's never but can you ...\nCan you can you fairly site where attorney general Chris ... has not been able to manage\nHis his his assistance it can you give me an example\nYes I can and this is because it is you're right it is more important than resume you know I've got a much better resume but this has real consequences for people to Georgia and I'll give you a couple of ways in which does um there's not want a system to turn to general working on organized crime right now\nThere is not one assistant attorney general working on human trafficking in our\nCars you you've you've hit a topic and I've covered this most of my career because I interviewed people in the ... office under deal with on a governor do who had been working on sex trafficking basis or you absolutely sure\nUnder Sam ... there was a prosecutor there there is not an assistant a G\n... there's not an assistant AG right now\nWorking on let's talk about sex trafficking because that is an issue that both you all have talked about what is\nWhat's not happening in Georgia and I've covered this Mr belly since two thousand Seventy thousand eight whatever I'm not sure any state has a ineffective initiative in terms of combating this throughout the state what George and not doing that you think you could change\nWell if from right right now at the state level we're nowhere in terms of prosecution so if you don't have anybody working on the issue you can't even possibly have a full scope of what you're dealing with\nOne thing about secular state prosecutions local yes I I Know of ... county has and I think the kept count I came from Fulton County I Know that people that did it there no I I I'm Talking at a state level and so the thing is the duty doesn't live there's not one da or one chief of police or one share of\nThat can properly coordinating the entire state on us so the fact that we don't have any assistant attorney general working on it working on organized crime and I'll say this any prosecutors or any person who stands up starts talking about human trafficking and they're not talking about organized crime\nThat's your first 'cause they don't know what they're talking about and you see it all being connected it is all connected it's organized crime syndicates that are doing this extra they're the ones doing narcotics trafficking and so the first thing we have to do this one I'm going to build an organized crime and gang division in a jeeze office which does not exist right now\nAnd then once we have that we've got identify the Oregon at the top most violent organized crime syndicates that are operating in the space is now\nBut it in Georgia part of not only statewide but some national task force and an interstate agencies that are working that have been working as it relates to sex trafficking as well as opioids which will get to in a moment show or you are you absolutely sure that in terms of that that the stages off is not\nInvolved in in ... you're talking\nAbout the ones who is prosecuting as opposed to initiatives to let's say exactly okay anybody can sign onto a task force I Am I can go to a meeting and it's not that I'm saying those aren't important\nI Know full well there are local prosecutors in their federal prosecutors in this state and out of the state that are working on this issue my point is there is no the only person\nThat state ... is the attorney general and he doesn't have any assistant agencies prosecutors working on prosecutions there's not been one prosecution out of the agencies\nThat jeeze phone or is it being able to work with whether it's the GPS guy or other state law enforcement because they have to catch these individuals or what role in the eighties off as being in terms of capturing because you you wait for them to get captured fires right correct\nWell it's manpower\nRight when you've got\nWhen you've got an issue like this\nYou've got that when I was just said I'm going to build an organized crime and gang division for the first time one doesn't exist as an opinion that's affect your your correct that are the fat doesn't exist\nThis unit would be stopped with those investigators and prosecutors and these folks are the ones that you know these are long term investigations\nYou know which might called proactive as opposed to reactive investigations and so\nThat is exactly what's supposed to be the role of the state's top prosecutor which is what the attorney general is supposed to be and so you would if not replacing was being done by the fed does not replacing was being done by local it is\nIn there and you mentioned you said nine percent of the state is protected it defined that for a listener I mean I understand what that means\nSome state of permanent protection whereby the use of that land is deemed highest and best for some sort of outdoor recreation or a nature service that it provides\nAn and I'll add to that looking locally\nIt just five percent of Atlanta is a public land um Atlanta area is publicly are protected as parks so that means that our city in the forest much of that forest is privately held and so efforts to try to acquire land um it to make sure that we increase that number will be an imperative is Atlanta gross\nIs the core of this the key then all about just more funding\nIs that that really where this all boils down to it's about a dedication of funding rose that recognizing that although we've had strong leadership that has put money in appropriations year every year for water and land conservation\nThere is a greater need then those appropriations can necessarily need and we have this opportunity to a set aside funds that can only be used for this purpose for the over the course of ten years and its voters approve it there are a lot of numbers big numbers here because the state\nUh it's been at least about twenty million dollars as much as about forty million on land controversial per year for at least ten years is that what we're saying that's exactly right so this is a portion of the existing sales and use tax on sporting goods equipment\nThat would be collected and allowed for use only four three purposes one is investing in large conservation Lance per the state's goals\nOne is parks and trails that can be a developed in partnership with local communities and the third is making sure that the properties that are already own or well managed okay so you mentioned investment you miss in parks and trilogy you talked about properly maintaining what's already out there how much money\nDo you all know goes into currently goes into would you want to call it land conservation Michael for\nThem it's a it to be honest it's a very hard number to come to because it incorporates the buckets that I just laid out\nCan't count not only what it's meant to buy land for the state of Georgia but also what would go into managing those lands and so year over year those numbers have varied over time uh which is one of the reasons why we know that by dedicating these funds\nWe can create consistency and having twenty million a year that can be spent such that we can plan better in advance for how to spend the sudden so will this directly affect that nine percent figure that you ... okay because you're able to able to invest it in New lands that otherwise right now\nAre we not don't necessarily have the funds for cap plan ahead Michael\nHow's that trickle down to Atlanta I think it comes down to the issue that local governments and our groups like my own that helped to bring philanthropic resources the what we need as leverage and there's a number of different examples right here in Atlanta and find city park\nAre corkwood urban forest a morning said nature preserve that were purchased with state lands are state funds and the state funds have been been layered on with our private sector dollars in money from the city to take those different opportunities and turn them into public festival parks\nNow you all know when it comes to lots of money and who gets to manage it and who gets gets oversee it that is a valid concern when you're a taxpayer your voter so who's going to control these phones\nAnd design out of the money spent and you know some people do it right to say you know what I don't look at CERN where this twenty to forty million is going to go and who decides who gets what and then later down and\nHear Michael said well I didn't get my five million and then he ... he says what's up\nLet me start by saying that I think this is will be some of the best watched funds that exist in our state for any purpose\nSo you're looking at two hundred million over ten years that will have to be reviewed by a board of trustees that will be established per the legislation it will also have to be reviewed by the department of natural resources so they started Russia ... a new board would be ...\nWho would appoint the members to that bores right so that is the U.S Senate and house with a point that the members of that board and it could be legislators it could be private folks from organizations all I mean it was gonna be All right now ... right now what we know is that it needs to be people with expertise in natural resources\nSo that includes the head of the department of natural resources\nAs well as the head of some of those of sections under the department and will someone like maybe in the capacity of Michael would he or she be able to possibly be a point to this for absolutely because we see this now with the with the transit for new people already upset about who's on a boy and he's on a board that's right you can look at that as an example Michael with this ... what are you expecting\nWhether you're on it or not but what would you expect this from the sport as ...\nAs I see it I think that I'm a part of the public oversight and really the role there are six different organizations that came together I'm advocating for this and I don't think our job ends on election day so once this past there is a rule making process that will have a public review process we will be engaged in that\nUh once the projects are um than solicited and selected there will be reporting on what actually where those dollars go and making sure that once those dollars go in those areas the investments in fact occurred and so the way that I see it this ... this um amendment has a ten year sunset\nAnd part of that is really making sure that it delivers as build\nOr we really see this as an opportunity for leverage when we look across the country I think we've learned a lot in terms of the oversight and protection from other areas and we've heard from other folks that ours has among the strongest safeguards that people have seen and when I look at the different threats to our environment and our economy because of the um the the growth that we're seeing in that kind of thing\nI'm I'm very hopeful that we will see I'm an effort to make sure that we knew this but\nA part of that whole oversight really comes back to those organizations that push for it to begin with that we will be the first to cry foul if we find that it's not going towards its intended purpose is\nIn there and let's look at another scenario here because if this does pass and you know also this is you know it depends on consumer habits as consumers by sporting goods equipment you know the market could change is there are you hopeful that\nThere is something that sort of a compromise because I can understand someone saying well look you know what that project it sells revenue is and what we thought it would be maybe there has to be some type of modification\nIs this will this be built into that are you hopeful that they're saying there's flexibility built into the legislation already and so right now our opportunity has to take advantage of a really strong consumer market\nAnd or your folks to go out and ask them to buy those things and you can count and knows they're going to go into the outdoor areas they love it's a it's a win win you said it's a win win or\nI'll add one other thing that I'm a you know another question that comes up in these types of things is what if we have an economic downturn and they're actually controls that are written into the legislation that actually kind of release the regulator in certain conditions to make it so that you free up the hands of government to respond to critical needs\nUm so again I think looking at the fact that we only had one legislator out of the entire house and Senate voted against\nSays that there's overwhelming support for both uh liberals and conservatives and everyone in between for this and it's mainly because of the four thought that went into this this is really this election season and these amendments this has really been non political political issue it's eight out of ten voters out when polled said that they would vote yes\nHe only had one state lawmaker that I think voted no incorrect his concern that you know perhaps you're taking money that can best be used for a different cause I mean that's a valid point and and his peers decided that this was an amount of money that was actually not going to negatively impact other areas and was rightly stent and conservation\nWhen we got our parks and trails throughout the state of Georgia and you mentioned that as being one of the top three areas after investments in and also properly maintaining our parks and trails or they have\nI Know Michael is this while I'm Out in them all the time and they are definitely not a mess they're beautiful and credible area one of the ... you want to make sure they maintain\nThat ... and there's so much more opportunity I mean if if we wouldn't be at twenty seven billion dollars and consumer spending an outdoor recreation if people in Georgia I'm are taking advantage of these opportunities but there's more we can\nAnd along those lines I think it's it just to put it in perspective we hear a lot about the movie industry here in Atlanta that's less than ten ... ten billion dollars in comparison to twenty seven billion\nOr for the for recreation industry so there's just an simple economic terms it makes sense to support this the other thing that I bring up is I don't want people just to vote for this because it's good for the environment or they care about the environment when you think about public health and having access to trails\nUm having great parks a local neighborhood parks as well as great state parks there's a certain there's a definite correlation in terms of childhood development that kids need active places to play every day and these funds will help to provide that\nAnd um it back to your question and you know the the state of not a mass the state is um an embarrassment of riches in terms of the mountains and the coast in all the great things that make\nA Georgia such an attractive place to live rails we want to keep it that way All right Michael\nCommunications committee chair
