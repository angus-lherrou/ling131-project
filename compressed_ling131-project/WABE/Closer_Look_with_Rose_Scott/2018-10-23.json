on those nail ballot paperwork\nNow for example with the ... plaintiffs call small technicalities such as a voter signing the ballot novel up on the wrong line or riding the correct date rather than

far\n... Ginsberg ... had knocked against for his ... had had two children are older daughter Maryland who died um when she was six years old and\nRuth was to ... and so see a beta poured all this energy and intelligence in to uh the upbringing of his daughter\nAnd had found influence and you know like so many\nJewish families during that time there was a lot of anti Semitic narrative and and actions that was common ... do we know her parents taught as your caller Ruth about dealing with all of that in coping with the during that time do we have a sense of that\nOne of the things that her mother a emphasized a a great deal was the this functionality of anger\nAnd I think I think that to combine all fun and minority families not just ... and um but\nShe can remember various incidents if uh you know being called ... and and driving in Pennsylvania with her family and passing signs at hotels that said no dogs are Jews allowed and\nSo she was keenly aware of anti Semitism and I think her her mother's emphasis\nOn how anger was not functional was partly in response to that\nAnd a lot of her influence how to do with um\nJewish religion and that is\nMaking her daughter understand what ... meant repairing the world making it a better place a more just place she also told her the meaning of ... I'd say DACA ... which is sharing because really had\nA birthday party every march\nBut they never celebrated as did her classmate her mother took her a mother and her and took her to a Jewish offering the orphanage in Brooklyn the pride of Judea and um ice cream bars\nAnd she said later that you know surely disliked in ordinary birthday party like other girls and in her school but that it was such a joy it was so nice\nSeeing the the joy and happiness if the children that she\nCould appreciate why they wanted her to do that\nHow much access did you have to her one on one to Justice Ginsburg\nWhile I did a number of of interviews I think I'm\nSix before two thousand and six and then a three after that\nUm we stopped doing the interviews the year she found out that her husband's cancer had return and then resumed later on\nShe very open to the idea of you I took it she was doing this biography of her well\nIt didn't start out as a biography at all I was interested in the ACLU litigation and I went to the archives at Princeton University the ceiling mud library which is depository of the ACLU are ... and um I was able to get the\nCase files for this read the read breach which was full of correspondence with Ruth and I was absolutely hooked and I said ... the rest of the uh women's rights project papers\nAnd they said we don't have them um and I said sure yes we're sure the the um FBI wanted them when she became when she was nominated to the Supreme\nCourt for background checks for background we we've heard that before lately everyone with and uh they\nSaid they must still be at New York so those are very frustrating period when I was trying to figure out what had happened disease and a colleague of mine said well why don't you write to Ginsberg\nAnd ask her to help you locate [noise] and\nI got ... letters in my mailbox that that left us women see these records which was written to the ACLU\nAnd it turned out they were Los\n... ... in a move between buildings in New York of the national headquarters and she said well you know she was teaching at Columbia to time and she said you know I had a record in the fall cabinet at Columbia\nAnd uh You're welcome to look at those which she had transferred to the library of Congress men stripped division ...\nAnd so she was happy to talk about those um and she had said to me let me know if you have any questions and then one fatal lay I called up and said\nUh the interviews will always it's a four o'clock on friday before Labor Day\nAt the court and they could extend longer and and uh\nThat I'd like to talk next time about Flatbush\nWhich way she had grown up in Brooklyn yeah\nAnd she said we don't need to talk about Flatbush a\nAnd I said well I think it's important because they're I've read articles in which the differing descriptions of\nWhat cancer your mother had and I mentioned a couple of other contradictory um um things that were important and I really I think it's important to know the facts to have the facts straight\nSo she agreed to give me half an hour\nAnd I guess at that point that since we were working so hard to get the facts straight that I write up what I had gotten a friend\nHalf hour interview which I think stretched forty five minutes and then I send it to her you know after I had to type it up so the first chapter was by far the hardest to do because it took me for ever to get all the material was in the first chapter\nYou mentioned that\nWhen you read it you thought hey this is this is pretty good this is already being touted as the most comprehensive and detailed\nAccount of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg do you you see it\nThat way it's okay to sometimes they know what my work is this is the truth right here it's a life it's her life\nWell it is to the extent to the extent that I could get all the sources that needed I mean that you really never know I think when you write about another person's life\nThere always things that you don't know and when you interview a justice\nWho's a custom to control um\nI Can't remember I can remember asking a question and if she didn't want to answer she didn't inherit and I would come back next year and in the context of other questions\nAsked the question again usually by the third time I could get an answer [noise] well\nThe book is called Ruth Bader Ginsburg a life the authors Jane sharing the heart professor of America and of history at the University of California Santa Barbara ... being to on your speaking later the Atlanta history center thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed it\nWell thank you\nI mean there's nobody I'd rather talk about hobbies so I I ... and you got five hundred and forty pages to back it up too much thank you [noise]\n\n\n[noise] I'm On your looked as a W. A. B. E. were so thankful for every one who pledge during the fall member Dr thanks to the staff and volunteers who worked a little bit extra to the student who gave Fifteen dollars to the new cornerstone members and to that person who don't need it at five oh eight am\nAnd she said no no stay in color I said she can I have to go no no steak chicken this is my job and she said no it's not your job is carrying me you know like that and of course\nShe was right my job my real job was carrying her as all of our job is to carry children and and the last time I held cheek or was one I carried her after she died a in a little bad in our in our room with my wife\nAnd me right next door and\nBut you felt to her final heartbeat literally go out of her body and I carried her a outside to the you know to the Hearst was waiting in so\nCarrying her was a wasn't honor and uh I'm actually working on that book now that I intended to do and that's going to come out next year I Believe in it's probably best that I waited and got the fiction kind of put it in the motions into the next person you mean heaven but\nI'll tell her story one day\nI'm going to get back to the book I Want to ask you ... did you talk to her about heaven\nYeah she talked to us about having a and of course she said well first she said how did you find me remember that night distinctly she was lying there and we were just kind of voting on her she was in her bed and out of the blue she said how did you find me\nI said what do you mean how do we find you how did you um is Janine find me and I said you mean how did you come to us at the mission\nAnd she kind of not it but I realized to her that's probably what it felt like because she didn't really remember her mother\nUm and it felt like she was found like she had been lost somewhere and all she really remembered was life with us and so then we started talking about you know that you would see her mother again out and she said well how the how she's going to know me and I said oh she'll know you why she\nDidn't see me she doesn't see me now you know she was using a seven year old logic and I said she knows who you are and and she'll see but we never really talked to her a lot about her illness you know we we weren't people wouldn't nicknamed her tumor to me the tumor or anything like that I I Want her to be a child as long as she could and that's what we did\nIt get back to\nThe next person you meet in heaven if folks haven't read the five people you meet in heaven can they follow\nYeah yeah yeah you have to always sort of prepare for that and Eddie makes a a return visit or in this but it's not a prerequisite for knowing this is the story of anti ... and anti or who is eight when the accident happened uh now is grown up and she doesn't remember the accident and she has sort of traumatic\nOr you know memory where it disappeared and all she knows is that that morning she went to amusement park and that night she came back\nAnd she was injured in the accident and everything changed and from that point forward she was kind of shadow by the idea that she makes mistakes and of course she did make a mistake that day but she doesn't know why and so everything then throughout her life as she takes that point of view high school\nAs a bunch of mistakes and relationships bunch of mistakes and they've been trying to find a job mistakes and and she just thinks she's one of those people that everything she touches goes wrong\nAnd finally she marries her childhood sweetheart and she thinks finally I did one thing right and that turns tragically wrong on their on their wedding night and she dies trying to save her husband from a balloon accident which is similar again to like the big crash and the first book in the first chapter in and\nShe goes to heaven and she meets five people one of whom of course is Eddie\nAnd Eddie is the one who really finally it illuminates for her to know this wasn't a mistake and your life was in a series of mistakes even the thing that you did with me wasn't a mistake and he kind of shows or how it all fits into the bigger picture how long it take you to write this was about a year a little over a year year and a half\nIt was easy to find that voice again once I you know I was surprised been Fifteen Years since I wrote in that voice it's sort of a a gentle narrators voice almost tell like telling a fable or and every book has its own voice so you have to ... that's really the trick to settle into that boys\nBut it really came back to the U.S surprises you must authors and now I Know like what are you know the jak richer writers or Harry Potter or whatever the you know they just conjure up that oh here we go again and they bring the characters back and you can have that voice return to you\nKnow when people like they tell you and you say to just write your like come on\nWell the the biggest difference having been a journalist and being a novelist is when you're a journalist or you're writing you know a true story you say boy this story would be amazing if he had a brother you know but of course she didn't so we can't when you're a novelist you say pull I just thought it would be amazing if you had a ...\nAnd they say oh I can give him a brother that's the good part the bad part is\nMaybe I should give him a sister [laughter] yeah maybe I should give them two brothers your imagination never shuts off you can always imagined another way to sprays and another thing that could happen to your characters and so at some point you have to say no\nI'm telling the story this story doesn't mean that there weren't thirty other different versions believe me of the five people than any meets in in the next person mean heaven I had like six other people that kind of\nAlmost made the cut in and you know training camp ended and they had to go uh but you know I could imagine the book with a different thirty Eric Durban but you can't do that or you'll torture yourself you never write anything\nYou recently told the Associated Press and I'm quoting here I really don't think my books are about death and I don't think they are depressing I think that the opposite and that was in reference to people like in your teens to always deal with Dan right where the afterlife right right well\nIt's more the death part of the afterlife I don't mind but uh it's ... to that question why are you still fascinated with death\nAnd I always laugh when I say I'm not that I hate death I Want to I don't want to come visit me I don't really like writing about that to me if he writes serial killer books you got something about that every ten pages you know someone gets her throat slash their head blown off you've got to really graphically describes it my books there's usually one death that usually takes about a half a page\nAnd the rest of his life but what I learned from Tuesdays with more\nAnd I guess I employed and everything that I have written sense is that\nWhen death is a theme or an element of your book you can get people's attention about life and the reason Tuesdays with more resonated with people in terms of the lessons that more he was saying are important was because he was dying\nAnd we believe that when people really are about to die there was a wisdom that comes that is different than the wisdom when we're just walking around perfectly healthy you're able to put everything into perspective and say this matters this doesn't matter you have thought this matter but now you're at the end it doesn't\nSo in each of my novels there's usually a debt that also kind of gets you into that year like oh wait well but that that happened and the nice things must have been important and I can talk about those themes\nLike in the first one that there is no such thing as a nobody and that he finds that out when at the end of his life in this book that there's no such thing as mistake after mistake after mistake that your mistakes open opportunities for you to do good\nWell yeah I could just write that but it's a ... bromide when you're right it it just sounds like a self help thing but when you write a story about somebody who died and die thinking that they were a mistake and then finds out that they weren't now it's a story with a lesson now it's a fable that's what a fable isn't so\nThat's the only reason that there's a death in my books it's ... to go\nOkay you got your attention now All right now we'll\nWe're going to talk about life so you're not Mitch out on the death writer no [laughter] I Do not wear a shroud I I don't live in a cemetery and I know I Hope to hype with the thumb blessed that I can live a long life and I want that for everybody around me do you read reviews of your books which\nHas long ago gave up on that I understood I understand the\nReview world and and uh you know being a journalist I have had friends who have done reviews and all the rest and I know that also being a journalist is probably hard for other journalists to write about a journalist who's writing novels I think right off the bat you're you're almost got to strike against you but\nBut I don't read good ones or bad ones then you know sometimes people come up and tell me about something that I you know as if they thought I read it but for the most part\nI ah I very much I'm a writer who connects with his readers and I do read their letters and notes and that takes up all the available time I have because they're very passionate and frequently there about their own heartbreaks yeah and you can't just\nYou know I always say being a journalist yourself you appreciate this when I was a sports writer\nPeople would stop me an airport since I recognize me from the sports reporters TV show that I was on and and they will you know like I beyond the moving sidewalks and they'd be on the movie\nAnd they say hey sports reporter is a a who's gonna win the super bowl and Hugo patriots and you just keep going\nThen after Tuesdays with Dorie and ever since that people will recognize me and they say hey I'm my mother just died from cancer and the last thing we did was read your book out loud together can I talk to you about it well you can't just roll buying go patriots yeah it doesn't\nWork like that you have to stop and you have to talk and you have to share and sometimes when people will break down right in front of me at airports or in supermarkets they'll start crying because they were remembering something\nYou need to be compassionate you know you've been put into this position for a reason\nAnd so my life is so full of those kinds of interactions and those kinds of reactions to my book there's not a lot of time to spend on if people's literary views on a good bad or otherwise\nYou mentioned you had some personal losses now\nCan I ask how you deal with those\nAh [noise] the best way that I can answer that without taking up a lot of time on your radio show is to give you an example actually from this new book because I wrote it as a piece of therapy for myself\nWhat are the implications for using money in that way isn't as good as any other stream of revenue\n[noise] well I guess you can argue it in many different ways but you know gambling addiction is a real issue in our country and especially when it's this tax on the poor and that in fact a tax on the poor ... it's a really worrisome time and that's also really worrisome that legislatures are in some ways\nAt the mercy of the lot out and really needed to make money and that's actually what happened then twenty Seventeen in order to make these jackpots bigger that we're talking about it like we are today they made it a lot harder to win the jackpot switch skyrocket\nSo are you saying that just because this is a record jackpot that we're looking at with this mega millions at one point six billion dollars that states are we being even more money or is it staying the same\n[noise] the states are raping more money but our education budget certainly is not in most states\nHuh you write that about half of Americans play the lottery today compared to almost Seventy percent in the Nineteen eighties what's going on with that\nI think people are getting\nMurder about how low their chances are you know I tell you a chance of winning the Marian says one in three hundred million that means nothing to you\nBut if I tell you that the same as your charm for fourteen occurring thirty times in a row and getting to hide that every time or your three more times more likely to be killed by a vending machine are winning and that can ... it starts to make a lot more sense we are getting smarter\nSo what's your take away is the lottery a good thing for states and for all of us\nI think it really begs the question about letter lotteries are good thing and I think what's very worrisome as having state legislators started at the mercy of lottery finding on that note I did buy a ticket I Know I don't know but I did and I will be checking the numbers tonight so I Am just as guilty as anyone else\nHey it's a complicated world we live in right you know you can say

John Lewis all talking about\nWe have to energize our party and even talking about the other party so all the message but who's listening beyond their respective party base now according to a study from the Pew Research center as of April twenty Eighteen\nFifty nine percent of adults who are elderly eligible to vote are you ... like me millennials or ... and I had to look up personally because I had no idea what it meant but the group is defined as those born from the mid nineties\nSo new year two thousand I also think they should call them post meals they ever know the name anyway young people are a group that historically do not vote in high numbers and if you're wondering what defines young people were talking Eighteen to twenty nine years old\nNow earlier this month we spoke represent us from the Atlanta young Republicans and the young Democrats of Atlanta to hear their perspective\nBut what about millennials who don't feel represented by the two major political parties will now it's time to\nAsk them what's on their mind so joining me we have Senator Ron jak hip and they nip\nCohn ... hello hello having a hard\nEnough already come up come close to the Mike let's talk 'cause I have a conversation um my first question and I'll start with you Jack um tell me what political party system you support and why\nWell I'm the I'm a vice president of a college but turns cuss State University um so I'm I'm a\nLibertarian Party or a or though I don't agree with every policy but largely fall in line with their a\nDoctor and I think you were to use to benefit [noise] ah well currently I'm the chair on the line ... Democrats of Georgia I'm\nI'm generally I voted libertarian voted green for presidents um I've left the county Democratic Party before I'm kind of you know trying to find a place on our space for our progressive voices and sometimes that's what the Democrats other times it's not\nOkay ... I'm at the moment I Would identify as in\nPena man I'm here as a representative um for the Georgia Green Party did\nAnyone here switch from and you'd ensues and you talked about it but I'm curious with the other two guests to just switch from previously supporting either the GOP or Democrats or any of those parties or the other parties it as well to\nJack I um\nI I Would never say that I mean I definitely support ... more than I support the Democrats but I have I mean how much time do you have to complete a few of them you know I have a lot of problems with the Trump Administration and everything but um [noise]\nNo I Would say that I've always been a libertarian or as I Am in my past I have only ever voted libertarian or have voted for Mickey Mouse\nSo you know K uh [laughter]\nBut um it it's hard I think to really if you're outside of the spectrum completely to ever really support one or the other um you know if you're not a part of it so\nThere's this conversation we often hear that voters have your age that you don't often make it to the polls although they say you're going to but you don't and then also that particular with the midterms you're voting bloc y'all never show up what do you think that is\nThe Senate um I Would have to say part of it is feeling disenfranchised as if these issues don't affect us directly um I think since twenty sixteen that's kind of unfortunately we have to wait that long for that to be a wakeup call for some folks but\nWe're starting to see how these issues do affect us directly both on the local international level whether that's what health care um affordable housing unit\nSo that do you feel disenfranchised and you know what part of that either the major political parties just don't address issues important to you\nYes or no Ivo I'm pot most likely mostly Democrat down ballot but there are issues are important to me people my age people that looked like me and he bought a whole lot of people like me and that just are either ignored or there's no substantive or bold stance on it\nYou say people who look like you can make that book\nWhich I'm an immigrant why men clear um there's a lot of intersections and a lot of times they are often ignored 'em for the sake of trying to reach out to someone who is a centrist or moderate but in that\nReaching out you're sacrificing or overlooking a base in Georgia the strongest democratic voters are you're black women\nBut what kind of issues have always benefited black women it's it's usually some sort of\nKind of haphazard or kind of um I Want to say lazy messaging and policy pot farms I'm just to say we wind or let's you know hoping matter who you know regardless of what their stances are even though a lot of\nDemocrats may have problematic policy positions that actually conflicts with that deep PG um\nPlatform\nJak what about you you feel disenfranchised from the the two major political parties I I Am\nAbsolutely um\nI think if you look at the presidential election you had a essentially to people who I think of the opinion of all the people were upset of the elite um protect solely an east coast elite um that I don't think applied to I mean you're you had to billionaire Seventy year olds\nRunning you know out of the plot for bankers\nAh you know and a big industry and Wall Street\nAnd how does that apply to ... year olds and you know or forty year old for anybody who lives in a part of this you know hyper wealthy um you know the idea they apply to a common voted not everybody used to apply that you know not everybody needs to out you know\nDog for coal you know it's one that okay you could be some kind of wealthy person but I think the same push to have to appeal to them you know share their interest or their their goals but I don't think that's an issue that we're seeing at all [laughter] um I I think that too much you're seeing people that are applying for a\nThat require huge amounts of outside money after we saw that in the George ... special election where we saw John Ossoff is receiving a or ten Fifteen million dollars with outside district outside state money [laughter] you know when it's I don't think I can apply or appeal to young voters by what what do you think\nThat's an appealing well to me specifically I mean I don't think they represent a fun right if you're if you're funded by somebody in California or New York you know we went away I don't see how you have my interests regular their interests\nRight we look at you know congressmen representing all the country when really they should be ... be representing ... ... you know and their constituents but\nDo you think then that with those two major political parties that they sometimes just take you all for granted they all all candidates say well\nI'm also reaching out to the millennials because I Want to serve for them to you all are ... are going on your way to becoming the biggest voting bloc if if you haven't already reached it\nSo when you hear candidates from the two major political parties say millennials is to millennials that do you feel like they're just using you won't because that might energize the base overall and do you feel like basically you take it for granted linen that\nI Would say that on one end we see 'em a shift to the left in regards to millennials in their political ideology um and I think that's useful in terms of a base ah in in terms of third party a groups now\nIt is you it is useful for Democrats to use that as a base um to advance whatever progressive policy that they they do have um they are trying to push but yeah\nSo then let me ask you this than you are now since you are an influential block or you could be what more could your base then your peer group what more do you think you all could do to get either the Democrats or Republicans in this case you talking about Democrats to get them to listen to you and really understand what platforms are\nMore important to you know what is your group doing enough well first\nEnough there has to be enough done for for us or by us you know there's a lot of us are rhetoric about the Latino Latin next community but the only reach out to us when it's the cycles are coming up\nBut you know where's where so much more than just immigrants and racist rhetoric and young folks like as I said I'm are shifting left and we're growing but the positions that the Democrats have are not growing as this base and becoming bigger and bigger and more and more left\nUm you know we care about being able to afford aren't we care about having a job after we graduate we care about going to the doctor and those are essential human rights those are essential for our livelihoods and they're not taking any bold substantive positions that we feel are trustworthy or reliable\nA lot of it really is just narrative about you know health care's are right but what what are what what are we doing like I can only do so much about\nAnd and you were saying that changed because more younger folks are demanding\nI'm you know something more bold and I hope that we can mobilize more I don't believe voting is the end all be all I think it's a strategy um but ultimately you know it's a system up held by you know old white racists than the ... system was created fight by them\nFor them so it's kind of harder for us to kind of you know take over through voting there are more there are more strategies um I think voting is one of them I'm not going to you know scratching off but I still do\nThey ... the last word you only twenty I ... I agree that voting is not the only platform we have especially in a grassroots level um\nMillennials are less willing to accept that you know we can't have healthcare but we can get fully fund a born of honest on that cost roughly forty five billion dollars a year or less willing to accept that\nUm we have to compromise in regards to what we want and our values [noise]\nThey ...
