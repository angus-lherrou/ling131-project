we continue with the city of Stockbridge mayor Anthony for to join the means to you come back to a closer look\nLimit on how you doing Rove I'm fine how are you doing just fine defined glad to be here once again let's begin here and for our listeners who may not know what this is all about and let's listen to the other side about the need to create the city of eagles landing ...\nHit is about a lot of things and I did it community identity as a as a big part of it because you know when you\nWith only cities you know Sandy Springs it was noted as Sandy Springs ... before Sandy Springs in the navy or we're gonna we're came in at the same thing you have that community identity which is very very important to folks that lived there but then it it it does it brings on that identity that for example we had someone who is on the city council Stockbridge\nWho is a real it's real estate broker and they lifted their property\nOr as being an eagles landing and he goes in and out of the city why did they do that because they knew their identity they want the identity and they want to press stage that goes along supposedly\nNow that is Vicki ... who chairs the eagles landing educational research committee mayor for the response you've been hearing it from the beginning to now right part I identity\n[noise] well the thing about it is is that a parts of eagle lander ... regardless\nOf that aspect and I would think that it remained but to the city has its own identity very diverse community itself\nAnd and because it's very diverse you'd have different ethnic backgrounds and economic backgrounds of individuals' period\nAnd so and we wanted to capture established at it and spend on that where's that were city for all people all all races all concerns all all diversity\nAnd ah and we're going to do what we can end up in the future now and in the future as we get over this particular speed bumps as I call it\nTo do what we can for all the citizens out rightly let's talk numbers here right now in the city of Stockbridge what does your population route twenty thousand and with the proposed city of eagles landing rather than about some all there'd be about nine thousand and we'd be taken out as the limits that this occurs but I'll I'll tell you it's not going to occur the citizens are going to I'm\nGoing to make sure that this doesn't happen they're going to vote this thing down and keep the city complete and all\nThat that's that's very you sound very confident but considering that a good portion of Stockbridge won't be able to vote on the referendum you're counting on those who remain or who live and quote the ... area of eagles landing to\nAbsolutely ended up that ours is a small there's an element of folks that are in the Pacific it doesn't matter that can vote\nOr that have indicated that they don't plan to support this this particular city hood initiative and they plan to stay inside the live stop presented you also have people that are on a corporate county area they'll get an opportunity to vote\nAnd do what I'm also here and one of those numbers in that area well just about six thousand or so in that area but\nSix thousand won't vote last correct but then again six on residents I don't know the actual numbers for the actual voting population but the point of it is is that what I hear is that a lot of those folks don't want to be in the city of St operation or be in the city of eagles landing so the voted down as well\nThe recent ruling from the judge that said look this referendum Wilkins ten you will happen and obviously you all were opposed to that because not all of the residents all the voters eligible voters will be able to vote which you also it was problematic because\nWhy would you vote to carve out a section of a city to create another city if the only ... the current city can vote absolutely not and I'm One of those individuals that they cannot vote in this particular missions of where I live in the northern part of Stockbridge itself\nAnd yes to the uh they decided to both the the federal court as well as the Georgia Supreme Court indicated that would not stop the referendum\nBut yet of the ways they still alone is a decision in reference to the merits of the case that still yet to come in that aspect\nAnd the judge to go on to ... ruin as it relates to the municipal debt and I want to get some clarity on that as relates to these bonds so these bonds are issued in two thousand and find the two thousand six an amount exceeding about Seventeen million dollars right\nSo what this really now you've ... let's say if the eagles landing does become city okay they are going to be responsible for\nA certain portion of the the debt that we owe to Capitol won and that'll be proportionate to the amount of parcels that are taken out of the city compared to what is still remain in cities would understand however though does the\nProponents for the city of eagles landing at ... didn't inaccurately misled the voters because they said this was his\nAss right indicated that ah that would be no property tax and the Senate and by the federal judge his response and and and and that was written up in order there they would be some type of tax associated with this\nAnd I will tell you rose that individuals that are inside the city right now do not have a property tax so those those individuals that don't have a property tax it would be kind of crazy to\nNow knowing this would kind of said yes I Want to be a city knowing that you would have a property taxes that you put on yourself and the individuals that are in the county that do not have a city property tax because of not in the city and then they will be posing as a potential is a property tax on themselves as well\nAnd these bonds correct me if I'm wrong therefore because these bonds are pottery development for the city correct with any of that redevelopment gonna take place in the area known as the eagles landing\nUh as far as I Know at this point I Would say not know so they would be on the hook for developing that's not even happening well here's a here's the thing rose to ... you're talking about the economic or do that they want to take\nYou to even find a parkway and that is that is the funding that's revenue in a franchise fees that support to ... percent allows us to have no city property tax for the citizens in the entire city\nSo when you want to take that away it causes a problem and how we're going to run our particular city when we're losing ... five million dollars of the revenue and a lot of our budget is operating but his little nine million\nFor what is in your opinion from your viewpoint is this really about identity and partnership\nNo I Would say no I'm not about a dentist I don't I don't think that at all things just about the\nFolks that that that may have been in power before I wanted to be in power again folks about economic development about doing the best for the particular area\nAnd we're ... the city because of the council myself I'm working on to economic development piece we just recently hired a new economic director and we're still we still have to go south which is highly ... road and they're still working and that will take off as soon as we get over this particular ...\nWe've heard both sides here in in even folks concerning that are concerned with the whole process of creating new cities and I asked\nAttorney Mike Bowers is yesterday in terms of the role such a journal simply place or some people think that it's okay that this is the legislative body that makes the decision because often that gets the ball rolling on whether or not a city will become a city\nAnd some say you know we're really just leave the vote have a simple vote and leave it up to the residents\nWould you prefer well that's that's one other one thought process but I Will tell you the process that they're having a general assembly is a process that probably still work you gotta realize that the designated area of eagles landing up it was it was drawn out by individuals and pushed by a local legislation but it never went to talk to those individuals\nIn that doesn't it is whether part of Stockbridge we're the ... part of on a corporate county area if you would have done that initially and talk to those folks you may have got a feel for what was going on whether or not those folks want to be part of a city or not\nAnd the process that do that you do if you do that did it take to Leslie process and you ... with the county and the city where that those areas stand then that's the proper process to go about but that was circumvented in this aspect\nAnd they thought this was going to be strictly a local legislation piece local issues coming national is the national incident\nWhat is the national ... and it well let's talk about the tax tax base here for sure because the tax base for the proposed city of illegals landing and the tax base for the rest of the same Stockbridge day\nIs there a disparity that lived up to the ... area per se for the publicity beagles Lanny they have you have people with more money in that particular as through a fact not aspect\nAlright so uh that that's fine that happens but in cities that are very much diverse and that's and leave or ethnicity or different ethnicities or that there\nHave different types of incomes aspect you could still live together still drive and you could still work together still move forward what can you all work together and get this we we will soon as we get older so we will make a point to try to do our best to try them in the city back together and myself to count on our staff\nAnd work with those opponents in and try to ... of the others proposed city and see what we can do to make sure that we get a straight and go forward as one complete city period\nAlthough you're confident that voters will not approve that referendum if it goes the other way you're prepared to me with leaders of the\nUm prepare to me one way or the other but it's going to go the city is not going to split the good lord has got to handle on this and the people going to vote the right way [noise] what's next for the city of stock rigid terms of all these legal fights though\nWell what ... what do you have and you still have some some legal taint leads to deal with direct or will will with real to them or two of them will do them illegally and wait for the results of both the the final results on America the case will to federal and the Georgia Supreme Court case\nAnd as you mentioned I missed my bars is working for the city star bridge and here in the legal team are going to do the right things but for the city and get things straight [noise]\nAll right we'll wait and see what happens absolutely Anthony for mayor for Steve Stockbridge as always we thank you for coming in from the tuition roast right\nHave you voted yet or not yet

Atlanta choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott you know earlier this year the national conversation around crisis pregnancy centers reach the nation's highest court\nNow the U.S Supreme Court weighed in on the case it was out of California over a state law called the reproductive fact act which requires self identified crisis pregnancy centers\nTo if they want it to fully disclose a range of services they do and do not offer and in June of this year the Supreme Court reversed a ruling from a lower court which upheld the law citing concerns over the first amendment and protected speech\nIndeed facts about crisis pregnancy centers are hard to come by they really are which leads me to the work of my next guest Andreas ... destruction brewer is assistant professor in the College of public health at the University of Georgia\nNow early this year she and a team of student researchers launched an online directory of crisis pregnancy centers across the u._s. you probably saying why we're going to ask her professor thanks for coming in to inside thank you so much for having me let's let's we always have to define and clear things up for folks\nBefore we get into the online data ... base I Want to talk about how do you define a crisis pregnancy center yes\nExcellent question and your listeners should know that I called them a crisis pregnancy center but they also go by other names such as a pregnancy resource center a pregnancy help center and some groups have taken to calling them fake women's health centers regardless of the name they are non profit organizations\nWhose primary mission is to dissuade people from having abortion or most of the centers in the United states are affiliated with national religious organizations that oppose both abortion and I'm contraception\nI'm In addition they have other objectives of a evangelists I'm promoting marriage promoting um sexual abstinence um until marriage they typically provide free services in order to influence um women's pregnancy and health decisions\nWhy they do the show 'cause that definition is just it's it's very long no one was there may say well if\nThat is your definition that is rooted in fact you know for fact these are the their initiatives in his these are things that they try to do because you know folks are listening and they want to clarity so self identified missions yes if I didn't find that you know do we know how many there are in the nation\nVery good question so I've been researching um George a crisis pregnancy Centers for the past several years um and what I found was that there really wide in this\nFor it um estimates on the number of centers anywhere from about two thousand to over four thousand\nAs you mentioned the Supreme Court case which came to its decision over the summer um got more high media profile and attention and again these very wide estimates and so that was one of our objectives with developing CBC map\nWas to a better understand the number of crisis pregnancy centers in the U.S and we identified um two thousand five hundred thirty seven centers currently operating in the U. S. how did you identify them\nSo we um the as I said most centers are I'm affiliated with national organizations that maintain online directory okay so we first consulted those director ease\nI have never been a kind of person but I Do understand the value in ... had to have to our history and chicken on race and ethnicity\nSo as we said Eric today NBC's airing a rerun of the program and there are sources saying that Megan Kelly may not return to the show at all do you think this is the end of Russia\nUm I don't know that they there are indications that she's negotiating to adopt some sort of different role that would not involve hosting\nThat time slot I I always thought it was going to be a tough turn for her because\nHosting a show where you're um eight punted and you're being very incisive and bold and aggressive about presenting opinions about the day's news is very different than hosting a segment at nine AM in the morning\nWhere you're expected to um be much more friendly you're expected to be you know much more welcoming presence and you're also frankly expected to appeal to a much more diverse audience than she was expected to appeal to\nThat Fox you know this is a broadcaster\nWorking in daytime television where the viewership is even more diverse than it is for a more conventional time slots\nAnd you know I I've always been surprised by the way that she could be so perceptive about how sexism works in society and be so tone deaf\nTo how race works interest in society and and and this is not the first time that she said something that's insulting about race either on Fox or um you know on our on our NBC show\nBut the same sort of dynamics when it comes to gender and sexism she seems to do very well with and\nAnd so that's a disconnect that is tough to understand sometimes with her how can you be so effective in rooting out or sexism and talking about that on the air but be so terrible and understanding the same sorts of oppression that people of color face every day in America\nTo NPR TV critic Eric Deggans Eric thank you thank you and here now is a production of NPR WB or in association with the b._b._c.

not that bad so the value of these statistics these kind of um um evaluation and research\nIs to say we've got a serious problem here and we need to be doing something about it she would do to reduce talk about that you know work\nWhich have we seen these numbers decrease over the years and you point to the fact that from the campaigns to what you all do with your individual organizations are we seen the number the incidents decrease at all is that\nThere was a very very recently um the latest report on the ranking states I'm a woman killed by men and the good news is that Georgia now ranks twenty fifth so we have made progress [noise]\nThe less heartening news is that a tonight partnership against domestic violence will hold a candlelight vigil where we will honor and remember\n'em all the victims of domestic violence in Georgia over the past year and we will read the name of every person killed\n'em through domestic violence and unfortunately we will read Ninety six names tonight of people that were killed because of domestic violence in Georgia is open to anyone who would like to come six PM America has syndicator and we welcome people to come it's a great place if you've lost someone um to both grieve and to to honor the beautiful life\nThat they were Ninety six from twenty Seventeen right over the past twelve months Ninety six individuals that is correct you left your tuner audience about men stopping violence\nWe are social change organization with a mission to engage men to work to advise against women through innovative training programs in an advocacy men stopping violence believe that it's important again to create spaces for individual men who wants to do the work we all ...\nBelieve it's important to engage the community at the end of the day we do not see mailbox gives women as a problem of individual men the culture is very invested in wanting to say this identified the few bad guys and go ahead and fix them and we're holding up the mirror to community say no you can always have\nThese few guide six but if the policies and procedures of practices that are based insects is thirty six this drug or values it's a structural issue and I just fix your cat just fix those individuals and I think going back to you you're you're sharing about the highest it ... it's a really good example where that institution in my view\nSaid women is much more important than women's lives and that held up a really powerful mirror and you had a Buckeye fans\nReally on board with the schools and saying a lot of horrible things about and I'm blanking on um the survivors name right now but they're basically got permission from the school\nTo behave in horrible way to say that yes let's start with coach\nMyers and ... and although it was horrible and people were releasing the address where the the and we don't we don't know the whole story\nBut you're right that led to behaviors they're supposed to talk about behavior because someone said look you know what is it just simply for this behavior they need counseling is it they should be locked up you know is there any proven\nWhen you talk about how to use he talked about how do you fix someone ... you just can't fix him overnight and you probably just can't fix them through you know\nTherapy groups I don't know how we begin when you talk about someone who is is the abuser how to use\nSo we're very major part of being an abuser is I'm not taking responsibility for it is saying it's not me it's the victim's fault she made me do it she wouldn't be quiet ... fix dinner I just couldn't take care of the children but it's all out there and the user sees themselves as the victim so I think intervention has to be\nWhere that abuser begins to recognize and hold himself or herself one in four women one in seven men will be victims of domestic violence so it it does occur both ways eighty five percent of victims are women\nBut where the abuser hold themselves accountable and begins to acknowledge I'm responsible for this behavior criminal intervention can help the abuse or understand they're accountable if I'm arrested and go to jail\nThe person the system is saying hey this is me I have to change the right kind of therapy the right kind of intervention where it's not oh you poor person what happened that you resolve this of violence but\nViolence is wrong you have to acknowledge that and you have to agree that you're going to stop that can be very important and let's talk about resources because often\nThe abuser may be the person who holds the the the household the finances they may be the only one bringing in a steady paycheck what resources are available whether it's men or women here in Georgia when that is the situation rather\nPartnership against domestic violence we have a twenty four hour hotline for oh four eight seven three one seven six six twenty four hours a day three hundred sixty five days a year there's a person on the other end and the first thing that you're going to hear is hello are you safe because then all of our services we want to be sure that we're working for the safety of the person\nWe have to emergency shelter as we have supported housing in the community we can help people with legal advocacy obtain temporary protective orders\nThere's forty nine shelters in Georgia so if you're not in the metro Atlanta area\nGo online and do a search say you know set in ah Georgia domestic violence shelters and you can find resources that are closely located at the other challenges that relates to some immigrant communities\nThere are challenges they're absolutely challenges and frankly I'm In the current political climate it's even more difficult for refugee in immigrant communities\nUm abusers will use what they see as the person's weak point against them so better as well say you're not here legally called the place they're going to lock you up they're going to put you in jail they are going to take your children from you and they're going to deport you\nThere is relief for women who are not here documented if they are victims of domestic violence said that's not necessarily going to be the case that that fear means that we are seeing a\nSharp decrease in refugee an immigrant women that are sticking assistance than recently that there was legislation\nThat was passed that would allow for a\nAn someone who's a victim of domestic violence to break the lease and not have to do with the process of being ... so that\nThat helps very important legislation because if you even if you have a temporary protective order against your abuse or if he knows where you live he can come\nAnd stock that site and be there waiting for you and you got to go inside and outside at times so that ability to break that least without financial penalty and get to as safe living place that the abuser is not aware of can be critical I Wonder if they are really important point you know people always say well why don't women leave why would you stay and put up with that\nAnd there's lots of pieces to that and important piece is that when ... are in greater danger of being killed where and when they are in the process of leaving our after they've left the abuser so to think oh just leaving everything will be fine that's absolutely not the case\nHe left her how what's the the youngest age you all are working with with the organization and is it is it enough do you need to start even younger\nWell as\nMiddle school and those who says that we go into the community wherever we're invited to talk about this issue so we get invited to middle school high school college and we think that's really important to get to that community as as as quickly as possible\nI was going to say also about the issue of resources for men out there who believe they have a problem and wanted to do something about it we have a twenty four we program that they can enroll in a and that could really make a difference so they might suggest they call the office at four four\nTo seven zero nine eight nine four or go to W. W. dot ... dot org also we believe that this or not to be again about men who have I been been who have\nBeen identified as having been abusive to women or men into community who are concerned about the issue so we happen to a community forum I Believe in November thirteenth and being decided by head right now\nAnd this is open to everyone in the topic is a men's response to the me too movement because we believe again as part of our responsibility as an organization is doing gauge the community to educate the community about the issue of violence against women so I just wanted to put that out there as into an opportunity for the community to get involved with this issue\nAnd there's so many issues that we didn't talk about that we need to ... think about same sex relationships as well there there's just so much that we didn't get to but before we wrap up I just want each of you to reflect again on the importance of people reaching out whether they are the ... with regardless of whatever they are in the relationship the importance of people reaching out\nOver eighty percent of child abuse cases come from domestic violence households as well as most abusers were victims first so this was a\nR just continue pattern um my dad also so it was just a continuous pattern of this is the norm this is what was taught so when I was fourteen and dating another fourteen year old who saw domestic violence\nAnd his household when it happened the first time he hit me I got my first set of black guys from him it was um in my mind is what I see at home uh this is not on that was his norm so it must be okay and I'll never forget uh\nWhen when the incident happened I had to walk into a mall because I was doing some modeling for the mall and they sat me down and a chair to cover the cuts that I had on my face is and not one person asked me was okay did any help it was just lead paint over there so that is if does it never happened and let's move on did your mom\nUh not the first time the second time which was almost three or four years later ah she asked and it was just as easy for me I was Seventeen Eighteen I said no way I got to close that fight at school I got hit and that was it\nUm we see so much throughout foundation and that's why we teach a lot on healthy relationships we send their purpose and for six weeks teaching on health healthy relationships that people can understand\nThere are a lot of red flags prior to the physical um and so understanding what those red flags look like knowing is just healthy or the signs that I'm seeing from aggression too threatening to hurt your animal different things in the nature of for people to make decisions that this might not be the best\nSituation for me and you mentioned that you were fourteen and working in the segment earlier you Lester talked about trying to have these conversations in middle school\nYes we start as young as Thirteen working with the masterminds victims so we work with a\nA lot of the EU shelters but we were in high schools where in colleges is the number one issue on college campuses as I said the nomination elegy TV community is an elderly abuse communities the AIDS community so starting young is very important\nSherman fourteen it's someone listening so that seems so young to start talking about\nDomestic violence not at all the earlier we talk about it the more um\nChance we have to eradicate it I did not grow up in a household with domestic violence young kids who were witness but I had children who were seeing their parents are involved in domestic violence and it was a it was a motivator for me to get out of the situation so that I did not\nContinue to uh to raise my children in that in that pattern trauma and have\nTo ask if you didn't have kids because you said it was four years in ... do you think it will take and you loan I Do\nThink it would have probably taken me longer I think people stay in abusive relationships for a number of reasons and that's the sort of touched on this earlier and said you list or but it's it's not just one thing it's not just\nUm you had too much to drink one night it is a cycle of ongoing um it's financial it's religious it's embarrassing it it's it there's so many different reasons that keep us I think locked into\nUm these these relationships\n... how do you know we asked a question earlier about changing behavior and you know look there's a twenty four week session for men right so we talk about changing behavior and you want to move from one from from being a victim to survivor\n... there's a mindset their to this therapy that has to take place after ... as we called it early just can't fix that what do you want to let women know about that process and and what they can expect\nWomen and men because both of them suffer from domestic violence on again it doesn't happen overnight but you have to be willing to do the work on one of the huge component is educating people\nOn how domestic violence affects everybody it's not just the not just the victim but how that plays out when you look at young boys between the ages of eleven and twenty six tape the sixty percent of them that are in prison or in print is prison for murdering the mothers abuser\nSo help people understand this is a a cycle\nI'm getting therapy not only for the victims but for the people that are watching if that means children um what that process looks like for victims as well as getting the of the abusers help so it doesn't happen overnight um you have to pull back layers wild ... like when we put aside\nTherapists and they go through six weeks of training is pulling those layers back saying what is it that had happened to your and your decision making that has made you think that this is okay that you didn't recognize the signs and actually that a lot of it is due to low self esteem just a number of reasons but addressing those would you go through therapy now\nThere was not there be available for me at fourteen Fifteen sixteen now um is important now everybody on our teams I\nStaff everybody that deals comes through our foundation to work with survivors they all we all go have to go through the six weeks training to see but survivors are getting as well as you know to understand how it works with a therapy so no back then there was no therapy there were no resources\nFor me [noise] sure man we talk about this transition from victims of survivor therapy\nAbsolutely I and I still go to therapy I think it's important sometimes you just need to talk through some of your issues the great thing about a number of these organizations um\nI Know P. H. D. V. had support groups while I stayed at the shelter that gave me my first introduction into therapy in a small um group setting and then after we left the shelter they had community um support groups as well they gave us a listing\nOf all the places so wherever you wherever you were anywhere in the city you could find them help\nYou know Nancy mentioned there were forty nine shelters are thinking Georgia is a question isn't enough using\nAn editor and deny the the resources on outweigh the knee and started the need outweigh the resources [noise] they're not they're not not a lot of ships is because we get calls all day long with people can't get in shelter right or waiting list\nA shelters um and so then you put the victim back in that situation well I don't have anywhere to go right I might as well stay where I Am at least have a roof over my head right and so I'm no they're not enough resources out\nHere in Jordan and when you start looking at smaller rural areas like the area I came from Albany there were not does do support systems in place I mean think about the fact if you say that\nOne in four women is a victim of\nDomestic violence at some point in time in her life one in four and that is regardless of economic status that is regardless of education that's regardless of of race or creed one in four women there are\nSix women sitting in this room right now so you can imagine that there are many people who are experiencing domestic violence\nWho don't say it for whatever reason you tend to see more people of color in the shelters only because the resources are less at times for some of those people but this is a problem that affects all women of all ages and creed color race ... ... it's it's it's widespread\nAnd I have to say so when you talk about one out of four women went on a seven males that's actually an accurate because only five percent of cases are reported so when you look at the other Ninety five percent and let's dive in each of those numbers as more of\nOne out of two women went out of four meals\nRight so you may not think you know a victim of domestic violence but you do\nAnd then later tonight AS Nancy mission and tragically they're going to name called the names of all those victims from twenty Seventeen just as we wrap up on each of you will for you to reflect on for listeners out there who may know someone who may themselves be involved in a relationship that is\nNot a good relationship what he wanted to\nGet help you don't have to suffer in silence I Am I suffered a loan for a long time and finally picked up the phone and call to help line and it made all the difference in the world to me you can call and get someone to talk you through your issues and options\nUh maybe leaving today isn't the right solution for you but there are solutions you can get help there are organizations available to help\nThem I Would say you are not alone um because when you go to a domestic violence you isolated you're told by your abuser there's nobody out there is going to help you um find someone safe to talk to or get that let you get the help that you need because there are resources out there and don't think it's a\nA daddy and to to need a means there are organizations like ours ... foundation allergy David foundation ... the partnership against them as long as there's so many organizations that we are here\nAnd willing to help you even a national domestic violence hotlines don't ask you because you all parents to any of these conversations with your kids Oh absolutely I have two girls and my girls have been very active since they were young I'm\nOrganizing working throughout the foundation absolutely my children have been to the P.
