... beer NPR News in Washington\nProfessor started what when you listen to some of the testimony like from Lindsey Graham was very passionate and emotional and his outburst\nBut some view that as being dismissive of a woman's cry you know or a woman's saying look I had been sexually assaulted could that backfire for the GOP if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nIt definitely could I mean there are certainly a lot of people have argued that it you know it's again the analogy in Nineteen Ninety two that it backfired that Thomas was confirmed but that it backfired on\nA Republican because there was now this up swelling if more women running more Democrats running they took back a lot of the seats there and I think there is a concern for the Republicans on that sense of who exactly is it going to motivate and what type of action is that going to have\nOn the other thing though I think is that it's not just that but it's also with a little bit interesting here is that we are in fact so close to the election so the candidates are already set\nThat is the one difference with the Thomas hearings is that it happened about a year before the actual midterm election it was in Ninety One and so you had the ability that prompted people to run whereas this time we already have our candidates an office and now it's the question of how well do they reflect even some of the sentiments that are being expressed well\nLet's look across the aisle here because if you want to put a lot of steak in polls and some people to some don't but there was a a national poll I think early last a month which indicated Democrats would they fourteen point lead over Republicans you know for the U.S house now\nIf you want to look at that point but it only sampled about a little over a thousand voters that show that Americans preferred democratic candidates for Congress over GOP can it do you put much steak and polls\nAnd if the Democrats are you pay attention to this or you do not because also it can lead to what we called voter apathy well as the Democrats are going to see that I'm a stay at home or hey we're going to take it so now let's get more Republicans out there that could depend on how you look at it and go either way so\nHistorically the polls that look at the ship like these broad national polls that look at sort of two people which party they seem to prefer within Congress do have some predictive ability [laughter] is it to the degree that it suggests that part is unclear and I think what's also again\nThat we have to kind of remember is that that say\nWho would you rather see in Congress do you want to be a Democratic Congress or Republican Congress but what people actually vote for or individual candidates and a lot of times people may want to see the broader Congress look one way but when they're in the voting booth and they faced with to the exact candidates are into\nTheir possible income than is\nAnd then they might vote a different way right a lot of people like their incumbent they like their representative even if they don't necessarily like what Congress has whole is doing\nFor the day these polls I mean part of it is what type of democracy or do we want to report\nTo represent because on one side many of the the just the bear out the fact that people are voting against\nTrump on policies in part about democracy has to function in the positive not be negative\nSo we don't make assertions about what we want as much as what we don't want it to be that becomes problematical for time because we're going to have to decide it's not that you're running against someone else's position what are you advocating for such that it resonates with me but I Would advocate for it\nInteresting because the pope projections may not be lost on President Trump would you just mentioned but this past weekend the president did continually supportive judge Kavanaugh\nVote to confirm judge Kavanaugh's confirmed one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time made yours was early where I go to public service you know\nFor ten years these young guy but for ten years they've been talking about him longer than that I didn't know what I've heard about him a lot because they were all saying he should be on the United States Supreme court that's why I put 'em up\nAnd and I will tell you I won't\nTell you he has suffered them the meanness the anger\nAnd two things here this is the president still continue to support Brett Kavanaugh but also to West Virginia\nSo you look at that in terms of which states that President Trump he will stop and he will he knows his base he knows which state that will rally behind him but the geo peace it is it is it dangerous though given that\nWon the FBI investigation is not over and we don't know which way this is going to come out\nWith the Democratic party is still invested in Wisconsin\nPennsylvania I mean these are states that had\nClinton you know done well\nGo ahead with well yeah [laughter] it wouldn't have been a problem would have been elected and so I think those are the territories maybe a little purple now so he can have West Virginia as far as the the poster that concern if those three states that are still major and so the issue again for me is whether or not\nThe candidates are going to run on the positive side that is these are the policies that are happening pages to your demographic versus against Trump because what if you win this time Trump's out of office in four years now what are you advocating for what are you pushing for\nAnd now you lose the consistency of you know protracted elections for professor\n... picking back onto a professor David just said if you're a GOP candidate and one of those key states do you really want to align yourself with the president right now and also Brett Kavanaugh or do you just remain kind of silent wait till all this plays out\nBecause as you just mentioned voters depending on what moved there in when they get to the polls they may forget about all that or they may be fresh in your mind particularly if a candidate has been backing\nBrett Kavanaugh and there's something else comes out and prove that may maybe that was something that happened\nIs it's a gamble if you're a GOP candidate and one of those states\nIt definitely is and I think that for all of the senators and house candidates they're walking a very fine line of trying to figure out exactly what is the best way to put this Ford right obviously if you are a member of the Republican Party you want to support the leader of your party who is the president of the United states at the same time\nThere are very ... there are concerns about what is going to happen here and what you also don't want to be accused of is a type of tribalism you're only supporting the candidate because a Republican nominated him and not because in fact\nHe has a ... a strong record or that there are not concerns about various issues\nUm because of course it's not simply about right the allegations that have come out but also questions about impartiality about whether or not there were um\nPerhaps misleading testimony in other portions of it that had already come out and so I think that that's a very fine line to walk about how strongly you want to go in on that\nBut if your ideal candidate and maybe even a democratic and do you also focus on other issues because you mentioned immigration and also here in Georgia Medicaid expansion is a big is a big issue as well as you know the economy and the good news if your President Trump is that you just got Canada\nTo agree to a revised edition of of NAFTA so that could play if you want to if you're a candidate usually want to focus on issues and not so much focus on Brett Kavanaugh you have the issues they look are caught him he's great now we have Canada and Mexico on board you know things are great for America\nI think that's a great way to put it I think in fact we do see a lot of the candidates trying to step away from it and instead discuss these other issues and I think in many ways we're seeing it not only in the Republicans but also the Democrats right a lot of the Democratic candidates are being very hesitant like it's not that they want to do a rally about Kavanaugh instead they're talking about\nMedicaid expansion they're talking about a C. A. and um whether or not there's going to be a protections for pre existing conditions there talking about a violence against women act and the fact that it expired last night and they're talking about re all of these other issues I think\nIn part because who wants to step into that morass because it really is\nAnd could it be just an overload professor Davis for the voter if all of this is we're just focusing on Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh voters get tired of that they want to hear something else\nAnd then we become sort of reduction us and that is social issues\nLike immigration um how pay the taxes who covers taxes will they be decreased increase for you lose the pro funded the of the serious issues and it becomes reduction is that is what would you have voted on had you've never heard anybody policies you would have voted on social issues\nWhat are you going to do with an immigrant and even here in Georgia where one of the candidates platforms about gang activity and then you associated implicitly with Latino and people from Mexico and the idea if even if you don't asserted conflict the issues tacitly\nLet's talk about the southern voter here because there are there's a lot of sub groups within that southern voter let's start with the rural\nPopulation traditionally has been conservative\nGOP however you look at issues as it relates to now with the tariffs and and and the ... increases that may not be an issue now because you work things out with Canada maybe not China yet for the first things our Canada and New Mexico this the rural vote who wins here\nThat's going to be difficult because I think if again what resonates and so part of it is\nThe candidates both have initiated programs more Internet connections that so I mean that's a minimal really so you're saying will offer more access to Internet\nBut they need to be in connection with the major cities that are in close proximity above it making connections so if you live in a rural area close to Augusta making savannah Atlanta what connections can be made I think that's more substantive but that's not what's being argued were playing to the most base interest\nAt first thing I Would agree and the second thing is\nHealth education\nAnd the more mature voter is listening for the particular is in this regard what are you going to do with our school how are you going to develop our schools is the amount of money allocated for schools going to be reduced the ball to property taxes because we know that creates an asymmetrical system and so now I'm In rural Georgia property taxes are disproportionately lower\nAnd over here and bucket right the issue is how do we now bring our educational structures up to competitive levels\nAnd I think that's very important but this is the educated voter and how you become educated the candidates need to educate individual on how these things play out if you vote and so the problem is most people as was stated they don't have fundamental reasons to vote if they can't see their interests ... being represented\nI've had people email me and say well I Want to vote my conscious as opposed to vote for either the two major political party and then you've seen these ... these fights on social media well that's why this is what you see that's why\nHillary Clinton lost because folks voted heck I mean these are actual social media fights that you say well here's one say well I voted my conscious signing of the major political party what's your response to that\nThat's coded language again you're looking for certain social you should write a book voted link golden [laughter] or tested I mean because the propaganda is what they didn't hear their issue and that social\nAs was stated do what did you say about abortion what about education what about safety what about the hospitals because again upper middle class people are not going to ask the same questions because worst case scenario they can pay private school\nI can go to emergency room and proud of my pocket right I mean this is a fundamental problem so when they articulating their political platforms it needs to be understood the individuals without certain resources are who you try to\nTell you are you saying you she wants to vote for the greater good as opposed to the self interest\nI don't think those are different concepts I think they can coexist okay problem is it's not been clarified part of the responsibility of electoral process and the elected official is to inform we've gotten informing\nInforming the populist about what votes do how they function and the allocated responsibilities of their respective office\nWe don't do that so I'd rather have an ignorant and the purest sense\nConstituency that assumes that I can do it I Can't and I promised them does\nRight that's what you do so even in the governor's race you look at promise of the problem is up to promise and oftentimes these issues have broken down by county a hundred and fifty nine county you know it doesn't work that way so they'll say we advocate for education no what specifically does the governor's office do\nIn education what role does the government I mean that the governor please\nDon't tell me you advocate for new taxes what does it mean and so again you play to the ignorance\nAnd the benefit is allowed them to ascribe a value to this amorphous concept and they'll vote that's when they built their interest because they've defined the categories such that it's still defined by me allow my constituency to put whatever tag or they want and they vote for that even though I won't do it for ...\nSomeone who wants to vote to conscious as [laughter] as a response to that\nI Would hope that it would be a conscience that would be educated and informed by what actually is going on and I think the issue is that just as such Davis was saying that\nWe haven't gotten to tell people why it is that we have to vote by lots of people say to me all the time when you do political scientist I hate politics [laughter]\nReally well are you interested in what the tuition is at the different public universities are you interested in why it is the roads aren't working in a place that you are you interested in and they'll say well of course it's like okay well how do you think you'll see that\nI don't know how do I vote\nRight these are the things that are handled by the people in government that's what the government does is they are in charge of how is money allocated throughout the rural hospitals rural hospital close it because the state has determined money shouldn't go there anymore and it should go somewhere else if roads aren't being fixed and they're being fixed in another place it's because the government has decided\nTo fix the roads in this area and not fix the roads in that area and the way for us to be able to have a say in that is well to vote and to speak out and to contact our representatives and I think\nWhat we've done over time as we've forgotten about that part of it most people don't realize that that's how these decisions are being made and so [noise]\nAdmittedly I'm not entirely sure what it means to vote your conscience um I guess it's to the Iowa actually not true without\nGetting emails about this and I will forward them fewer I appreciate it because I Would like\nBut I mean I Would say that if your conscience is hopefully fight determining the person who's going to do the best job for the outcomes that we need then okay\nWell you brought your preconceived notions that you brought to the table before anyone informed do\nWe start this conversation talking about the confirmation or whether or not he will be confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh\nThe FBI investigation continues this week regardless of what happens how again as we wrap up professor's talking about we'll just have a major effect on November or ... or even if there's something inconclusive as they say and it's still just word against word\nI think where the impact could be as in again I'm not sure that it's necessarily going to I think it could have a wide ranging impact but I think we're the impact is really going to be is on individual races so there are currently\nA hundred and Ninety ... female challengers running in the house Ninety seven of them are down who's twenty two of them are Republicans and I would imagine that for a lot of those female challengers an important question is going to be\nWere you in support of\nKavanaugh's nomination I think we're going to see the same thing in the Senate races that that's going to become an issue and that we're going to be seeing not talk to and so that might be on some level what propels there to be even more of these female challengers being successful than we might sort of otherwise predict\nBecause they're able to sort of capitalize on that issue\nPrecedent leaves with it I think it will be important to the degree to which on opposing sides if we barbecued and say those who advocate for about four or Kevin ... is going to come down to which side is gonna be galvanize and encouraged to use their vote\nAs their voice because right now what you're finding do you find the anger on both sides which anger is going to lead to voting that's what's important to you you can be angry in your library at home that's fine but it's going to come down to the polls so who's so much who's who's upset to the degree to which they're now going to go and hit the streets and vote\nI think that's where it's going to come down because I hear both sides argument you hear protesters on both sides the issue is how many of those individuals believed the voting matters\nThat wasn't that that will have some extended implications for the possibility of another Kavanaugh to come along later and again we have to educate people what does it mean to vote will now you see all these men are up you're making a decision about the legitimacy of a woman who's made a claim that's problematic\nAnd is not inherently problematic but ostensibly is a problem because we're hoping to some of these men have the moral ... that they can look beyond gender of themselves and say whether or not this matters to them somebody's voice of crying saying this is a problem so again the bottom line is\nWhat side is so angered that they're now going to say I'm going to vote and take\nThe French the polls way I'll take your friends your Davis professor of philosophy and African American studies at Morehouse College also Amy ... professor of political science at Georgia State University Thank you both for this and gauging conversation I very much thank you risk now we also asked voters here in Georgia what issues were important to them take a listen\nBiggest issue I guess for ms gun laws are the two or three year olds\nThere will be on track school at some point\nJust the fear of [noise]\nOf guns and what's happened that are passed so that that would be the most important issue to me\n... me and protecting plans pan head of Enron right\nConservative spending who's going to\nHave Washington says spend less money at a federal level but probably spend a little bit more money locally someone who\nI feel is more in tune with those of us that are in the middle versus extreme right and left\nSo that concerns me a lot that we're getting so does this and this country and I think there's a lot of us have feel so concerned that we're moving in one direction or the other and shouldn't be that way 'cause I think the majority of us are silent\nOut their services in the nation of working class\nImportant to me um [noise]\nFor the most part I mean we live in the southwest Atlanta neighborhood I'm Lucy the neighborhood is changing and we're not going to use the word but however it's happening\nI guess one of the main issues is like urban development and transportation but also like not leaving people behind in that process as seems to happen in general the the developed like the ... people get them behind so\nMainly Atlanta based issues 'cause that's just where I live but also the rest of the state needs to be taken care of his that's\nHis on immigration and how they view it in the states especially with things like the immigration detention centers like ones that are in Georgia in Lincoln county I Know there's a big on there it's kind of how they decide to handle that\nHigh minded debate about the way the Internet is structured but you know a few stream videos on you know Netflix or Hulu and you know this is really gonna affect\nYour data experience the Internet right which obviously we all depend on every single day so I think some people stay attention to this is not just stay intellectual debate between you know law professors about the meaning of the constitution that says something that you're going to affect our lives in a very ...\nBut again on the on the level of technology you know when this was opposed um id pie appointed is chair of the FCC and twenty Seventeen\nArgued about how this would prevent an investment broadband companies we could you just briefly and without breaking our heads explain why they are ... by the FCC and the ... do not did not want net neutrality\n[noise] yeah they just see this as you know onerous regulations on something it's not needed right I mean a pie said at the time you know I'm looking at a quarter you know to the Internet is free and open today and will continue to be so under light touch protections right I'm obviously the federal government or in concert reminisce\nAnd it's always just as looking out for the fact that which many state with too many regulations\nOr you know it hurts the private sector right and I think especially there is a concern here among broadband providers that California is successful\nYou could have a scenario where you have a patchwork of fifty different net neutrality loss um that obviously it'd be a regulatory minefield for if you've horizon a word for Netflix right um so ultimately\nAs soon as I think the worry is if if the states or to empowered than older than the federal government has no ability to control the way the Internet is structured overall and that's not good for consumers yes I think the the the most\nCharitable argument for the for the pie FCC is that they're looking out for consumers 'em and you know a lighter touch regulatory framework is better for them\nWell and ... and this and the state of California saying they are the ones looking

Atlanta's choice for NPR is always I'm Rose Scott as October Rosen and it's the seasonal pumpkins and Halloween costumes it's also a time when we're in is about the upcoming hold it flu season begins\nNow this past flu season was recorded as one of the deadliest in the last decade\nThe while an exact number of adult death relieves the lord never exact we do know that sadly one hundred and eighty flu related pediatric desk reported\nLast year which leads to these women are your questions this time of year what does this year's flu strain look like and what should people know where earlier today I spoke with Ashley folks she's an epidemiologist and the Centers for Disease Control and prevention flu division\nIn our conversation began with folks optimism about matching this year's vaccine to the influenza strain\nWell we monitor through the fees and how the vaccine is performing of it it does take time to get the answer to that question as last year's flu vaccine was estimated to have a forty percent effective this meaning that it prevented the forty percent\nOf flu illnesses from requiring medical care [laughter] ah this changes by the different viruses that circulate but ... was about forty percent so we'll keep monitoring that through this season and hope that it will be even better at in for the coming year\nAnd folks you know it is really difficult to I guess you'd call it matching the vaccine to the strength on a yearly basis is that correct\nAbsolutely we monitored globally we have a global network that monitors flu vaccine strains and we face her selection each season on the most carefully collected data that we possibly can have a but at the same time we're having to manufacture\nVaccines far before the season comes and unfortunately flu is really good at changing every year and so we can't really\nBe a hundred percent start until we get into the season and what we're going to find\nAnd coming into the segment I mentioned the challenges in Akron we recording flu related deaths for adults why is it so challenging\nIt is very challenging and what we do is we estimate we monitor the hospitalization rates and then account for different testing practices in different reporting practices and the different qualities of the test\nAnd from that we can make an estimate of how many hospitalizations fair are are in the country then once we know that hospitalization number we can also track us through a a\nVital statistics data a and the hospitals data the number of deaths that are associated so that's how we get those numbers you can also look backwards that medical care ... and they estimate for all types of\nInfluenza illnesses medical attended a doctor's visits\nFlu basically a and then that's how we get all of those various number for the pediatric death the one hundred and eighty unfortunately also only represents those that are boarded\nThose even those are an estimate that is probably the tip of the iceberg\nAnd let's go over because I Know our listeners really want to pay attention to this let's go over okay who should get the flu shot we always hear about those who might have you know a compromised immune system or we always hear about the aging population and also children is that the same standards should everyone get a flu shot\nIs actually the the vaccine recommendations are really simple everyone over the age of six months should get the flu shot 'em\nIt's especially important for the groups that you mentioned we have a flips that are at high risk of developing these serious complications from flu and it's a very broad list if anyone age sixty five an older children under five pregnant women\nAnd then people with certain have common chronic conditions such as diabetes heart disease asthma immune compromised\nAnd most important is also to think about even if you don't have one of those conditions how common on that list was and the fact that you can be in contact with someone who is a high risk for developing severe flu and you can protect yourself from spreading to them\nThe great thing about technology that it's not only through a flu shot with the needle that you can get the vaccine correct\nThat is correct we do have again this year the a nasal spray vaccine\nAnd the other courses when should one get vaccinated\nWe can never know flu is highly variable and it can start as early as October\nAnd so we recommend that uh everyone be vaccinated by the end of October ... and this gives plenty of time to develop the immunity because your body does need to at least a couple of weeks\nAnd then also for a young children getting their first vaccination ah they will need two doses of the vaccine twenty eight days apart so starting in October is really a minimum of that group\nAnd how common is it the during this flu season there there may be a new virus\nUnfortunately that does happen or the virus can change as a substantially even if it's not a new virus but have enough of a difference from the one selected\nFor a vaccine strains ah that that the vaccine is less effective but even in the vaccines that we've found that are less effective there's still overall effective and also the vaccine has several types of viruses\nThat in the back and live a vaccine\nAnd if it protects against two out of the three circulating strains in the community that's still a whole lot better than no protection at all\nAnd and actually just real quickly I Want to get some clarity on why should require two doses of the flu vaccine which took to dissect before me with more\nCertainly up for their first vaccinations up the immune system needs a little bit of an additional boost\nA to really develop that full immunity I'm In these younger immune systems so that first doses of is considered a priming does and gives some amount um\nUh of immunity but then a twenty eight days later a second dose brings the child up to the level of protection that you would expect an\nOlder child over the age of nine or an adult to have against uh uh I flew from the vaccine\nAnd as we wrap up it's of course you know we hear lock okay are you telling me that if I get this flu shot I Will not get the flu I don't think I've ever heard any health officials say that but\nYou always have to ask that question each year can you tell listeners what the flu why the importance of the flu shot he does not prevent you from getting the flu but\nIt doesn't hurt to prevent the influenza infections a hundred percent but\nIs extremely important to get vaccinated very simply the flu vaccination can save lives we have studies that have shown that it can save children's lives it can protect pregnant women and their influence after therefore\nOr it can help prevent serious medical events and the chronic conditions\nPatients uh and then it can overall reduce the risk of flu illness and serious complications like hospitalization I feel ... and very simply it can just help you get back on your feet again if you do get sick\nAshley folks is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and prevention which of course his base right
