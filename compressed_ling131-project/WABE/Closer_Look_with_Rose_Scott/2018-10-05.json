biggest misconceptions as well but I've learned very quickly that\nI've always asked CEOs and directors when they come into an organization where this nonprofit or whether it's a president over university and always had asked him what was the first thing you want to know about this organization when you agree to what did you do what did you set out to do [noise]\nActually I sat down and I said the staff\nI kinda wanted to get a pulse on what they were feeling what was going on with the affiliate kinda where I'm we needed to shore up some spaces um some some some at right now I don't think and I didn't want to go on with a broad brush and just make quick changes a kind of get a pulse and kind of what's going on here [noise]\nYou're gonna share there's a lot of need and the community um I think for us internally as an organization it's a matter of getting some processes and policies in place and making sure that we're all speaking the same language\nWhen we're talking to the public I'm showing up I board we had a little more turnover prior to my arrival and those types of things and and really that educational aspect of our homeowners\nAnd try to turn that corner I'm again and having them understand that they are homeowners are not renters anymore and and getting them more to do a lot of the um [noise]\nI Want to say international population will have a lot of homeowners [noise] um [noise] that sometimes the language barrier is an additional problems tied them understanding on on homeownership process\nAnd the cat is a very international county yesterday I don't think of the clocks in the area as well\nAnd so once we get one of them in a home they talk to each other and so then we get the influx of the whole community wanting to come in and try to get into a habitat\nOn you know prior to coming on the air we talked about that with some of the Iliad they're totally volunteer driven ruined and in some have huge operating budgets word is habitat for humanity the cab fit in there [noise] um where\nIn the middle I'm not straight in the middle but towards the lord and\nA part of that process we do have some great relationships with some corporate partners and some wonderful volunteers that I've been very dedicated to the organization over the years but part of my job as a comment and fortified those relationships kinda most stores them properly and add some additional donors am partners which operating budget\nRight now at one point to\nIs that a pretty decent amount for accounting side of the cat for ... or I listen anyone who runs the nonprofit will tell you I Would always like more and more funding but one point to is\nIs okay um it's it's a limitation in that I Would love to do more than one build ground up more than one home a year\nThat's what you're doing now just went home and you would do a lot more ... than we are joined ground up so we're doing 'em and some home preservation which is considered\nA brush with kindness program where we go in and help a lot of seniors are are they basically\nHe just completed a renovation about where we place the hot water heater for senior and we built her shed and did some things in our back in the yard [noise] um but those types of projects we've been doing as opposed to full round ups\nLately if you're just tuning in I'm speaking with sharing still see the new executive director of habitat for humanity\nTo cap so you mentioned not just building new homes book repair services for seniors veterans and those that have physical challenges\nAnd their community programs and workshop so someone listening saying well how can I find out what kind of workshops offering are they open for anyone to come in or do you have to read I guess apply you have to be eligible through some type of criteria now I Would like to make them open to anyone\nWho's interested in learning about the nuances of owning a home I'm In the process of trying to develop that program now but I Want someone to come in and discuss insurance discuss come in and talk about you know ethical payments maintenance of your home was one of those yearly things that you have to do at a certain calendar on what you're responsible for\nOne with tax and eggs that we've had people on this program said you know there are all these you know homestead exemption that they don't know about and so just educating people about being a homeowner and also where to go when they have those quest\nYeah and that's what I meant by Faye escrow have situation is not what people don't understand why they're payment is changing is because you're you're escrow has changed that made your property taxes are value has gone up which has changed your property tax threshold or maybe you have not apply for your homes that exemption which gives you a break [laughter]\nSo I have some of those situations I gotta make sure that people understand clearly and wanted to know what the insurance that we don't pick your insurance you have a right to go out and search for the insurance that you need for your home and what's the reasonable for you [noise] um so I don't want people to feel like that we are where where a hand out not a hand up not\nGiven away for free and I want to empower the education process exactly and so um that I'm I'm looking at partnering with some other organizations that are better equipped to do those classes or the partners that but we can partner together and do something while for the community\nWas there any training that you had to go through this do in terms of being an executive director of a habitat for humanity affiliate\nWell I just actually finished something they called ... which is no leader orientation a program for new affiliate leaders for habitat which was an international it's a week long process [laughter] certainly um it was a lot of information um gave you a broad brush of kind of what happens with all the affiliates across the country actually across the world\nAnd you learn that um the world um habitat has done some great work and we think locally um we want to get a home and it's maybe a hundred and\nTwenty bucks hundred and twenty thousand dollars but when you go overseas and they simply just wanna a roof over their head to keep the water from coming out and you know forty five hundred dollars goes a whole lot goes a long way and in Cambodia sure fire some of the places where we do a ...\nSo you're learning best practices or different practices from different affiliates in particularly international as well yes absolute what'd you take away from the training [noise] that you can implement here in DeKalb County [noise]\nThat people need to understand that first of all we've been in the cap counting since Nineteen eighty eight and I think part of that educational curve is not understand that all the affiliates are in your local area and that we are doing good work\nBut that we need support of the community\nWe need support of our um corporate partners in the area\nBut I Need them to understand that we are there to support habitat\nFor the families um multiple don't understand that most children when they have a safe and stable place to live it impacts that family them personally down the road educational wise even the family the homeowners who come and no they don't have to move\nIn a year or so or their rent is changing out without a fly from place to live with trying to create a stable environment\nThat impacts them personally but then at the jail course impacts the community as well\nHave you been talking to those homeowners that the cab that habitat for humanity to cab his work within the past you been on three three months now so have you reached out or you don't talk to those people and ask them what the process was like for them\nI have um actually I just had one um family that bought a home\nAnd they sold at 'em\nAnd they were so excited to go into the next level because they did exactly what the habitat motto is\nKind of built them up a bit so that they can learn about the process learn about maintenance money budgeting all those things that are necessary that can take their family now to the next level so they walked away with a nice little pocket change to go to their next home but they hug them pride and think that that was [noise]\nIt was amazing to see how you can touch people just by simply given them an affordable place to live\nThat's a success story that I imagine you will tell when you're out there trying to get partnerships to come in with the cab I keep going to say the cabins have definitely ready to get fit you said that success story\nI Will and ... and part of my training and part of the classes that I Want to I Want to be able to have my homeowner's tell that story I Want them to be able to come and sit here in front of them I can talk to you and tell you how habitat\nHas affected us and how it impacted their life so I'm trying to build up a confidence among homeowners in order to find\nThe fucking about vision because word on a ... you want to you want to re energize not just not necessarily reorganize what you want to re energize the organization mhm how do you plan to do that [noise] again [noise] focusing\nOn what's going on at the organization not necessarily ... picking at what we didn't do right [laughter] and trying to expand on that and build on relationships that are already there and expanding those relationship as well\nI'm getting out more do and things like I'm I'm not talking with you I'm making sure that I'm In the community raising awareness meeting a homeowner's on the job sites I was at a job site this morning we had a great um George transmissions sponsored home that was building\nAnd they were out there today so making sure that I go in and meet with them take photos polls do it on I Need to raise the awareness because I think once people know where their habitat has a wonderful brand and we can be able to capitalize on that\nFor the cap county residents because that's my focus you know we you talked about how do you navigate\nThrough this current real estate [laughter] you know landscape where you\nKnow market drives everything ... and in DeKalb County how would you assess that the the availability of of affordable land for you if you're going to build up\nIts challenging and that even the habitat\nModel um\nAnd that we don't do garages basements as I Need to change your thinking oh\nSolutions abroad is China's government have in terms of pushing\nWell China's government is not necessarily pushing for automation it is however a focus more on high tech manufacturing that's what they're pushing for under this plan called made in China twenty twenty five which is at the center of this trade dispute with the U.S\nSo they are encouraging factories to use new technologies now of course the by product that is automation but remember this is coming at a time when China's workforce is aging rapidly\nAnd a lot of the many factors we've been speaking to when we try to\nAsk them about this a trade dispute with the U.S how worried they are the first thing they talk about is not about that\nThey're talking about how difficult it is defined as stable working force because a lot of the young people they don't want factory jobs they are asking for less overtime unlike their previous answers they want weekends off which is not\nA usual things for a Chinese factories so a lot of these manufacturers are complaining that is very tough for them to find workers and so that's why when we speak to some of these factories they say automating is not so much about saving money it's a matter of survival\nJennifer ... marketplaces China

uncles look and we're going to have another conversation what to do with the goal which of course it's that forty acres of land under Philips Arena in downtown Atlanta\nNow the city led by Atlanta mayor ... bottom says this is a big opportunity to generate tax revenue also the mayor says an agreement with the California based developer see I Am ... represents an historic end quote unprecedented opportunity to bring much needed investment and redevelop it to the heart of downtown Atlanta\nIf we were to all lead here today and call this project call it will remain a hole in the ground\nWell hold on the ground and there's little disagreement that maybe something needs to be done to replace the rail lines and vacant property but depending on who you ask the current goats development proposal was a good idea needs work or his flat out terrible\nOne sore spot is the one point seven billion dollar plus public financing involved in the proposed to you know here's what Georgia governor Nathan Deal thanks\nWhen you're asked a wave of attacks that you're never going to collect anyway for a project really given up any good and that's what it amounts to an Atlantic City\n... has some concerns my inbox is inundated with constituents who are very very concerned about this\nAnd meanwhile there's a campaign called green light the boat which include social media ads fancy for color mailers and robocalls\nThere is a hole in the heart of Atlanta and an ... an area called the Gulch is Phil for almost a hundred years were parking lots train tracks and we [noise] but it's time to change\nNow there's also opposition to the current ghost development deal\nJoining me in Studio to talk about all this is housing in policy advocate ... brown is a long time residents here in Atlanta she's also a member of the community benefits coalition and also in Studio economists Julian Benet who's also a former board member of investment Lana\nWhich is considered sort of an economic arm of the city regarding residential and commercial deals thank you both for coming in and taking the time I think you\nUh let me start with you ms brown quite frankly from your viewpoint is is a good deal needs work\nOr it's just terrible and then we'll we'll come back\nWhat do you think I think that this is a terrible deal and it needs to be red light okay what's your name\nYes can I take on governor deals a claim a the reality\nWell see then you probably think it's not a good I\nAbsolutely okay I'll go ahead so the problem with the deal is it actually will cause a huge hole in the revenues for the schools in the city and the county or why is that because it's true there is no revenue coming in and goes right now that's not the issue the issue is this\nYou're either going to have big office towers built in the Gulch which will pay nothing for Thirty years in a way of property taxes or you're going to have a continuation of what we've been seeing last few years as the city of ... a a lot of jobs with people like Honeywell and some and so forth\nOffice towers go up right below his office towers if we don't allow this go skiing those office towers will go up around town where they pay taxes and the difference is two billion dollars in property taxes over the thirty years' when it when it gets full it'll be Ninety million dollars a year or property taxes which\nWill not come into the schools and city\nCoffers and and therefore won't be paying for cops and teachers and the rest so it's a huge a problem if we let this go through\nSo is there any part and we can will break this down in a moment but Mr ... been a is there any part of the deal that looks or seems promising that you could get on board with\nAnd maybe if the mayor and our ministry she could redo the other parts\nOf the road so I don't believe in negotiating with oneself uh this thing is so outrageous the uh it's it's when you're throwing the sales tax exemption your two and a half billion dollars this cash\nFlow don't worry about bombs that tool and on the other side I'm not for getting the benefits that are been author about fifty million so that's two thousand five hundred versus about forty five or fifty million\nI think it's wrong to get thrown around a lot of number and I don't want to confuse malicious elections back up all the because the total project is valued at a five billion and nearly one point seven five would come from what they call public financing\nAnd I'm saying is two two point five billion is going to be the cash flow that's what we lose it'll fun they say it off on one point seven five billion dollars a bone to actually to an ... billion would not from that much so that their numbers have broken out\nFrom you bring it to this conversation because

after advocating for you it through a tent city showing up at city hall because there were given the remained in of the ... money\nTo the hawks arena and we was like no\nYou cannot keep giving money to arenas in stadiums and not invested in these communities um that we have down these communities winning what red line and nobody cared about and nice hot item everybody want to peace\nBut the

sure you can get to the end right um and\nAnd so I just don't think they have experience if they use consultants they need to\nRethink that it ... if they use that they need to rethink it\nUm\nBut if you know they're getting ready to go into going that they're going to go probably next we'll be looking at cars there's people in southwest a cab or feeling pretty alienated from projects they've waited on for fifty years\nUh there's there's a lot of explaining to do and people need information and sometimes people come forward angry because they don't have the full set of facts and so you can't even make a cogent argument if you don't even really know you know what the facts are so\nThey've got a really if you're going to commit to public engagement than commit to it and get all in it\nAnd that's important because you know we're at a really unique a place in the in the region right now where there's a new interest in transit investment from some of the outlying areas like like going up\nAnd you know and the regional scores changing what group we've talked before about the city growing the region grove my two and a half million people over the next Twenty years and the economic forces or that puts him play mean but\nYou know the implications for what we build a system that we built will really matter for people's lives and so we have to be make sure that we're being thoughtful and transparent about the process of not only the system and so\nYou know there were some surprises of what did make the final list um some people were you know not very happy that the project didn't include a a rail line to the west side so to speak to your thoughts on that yeah we were talking about that you know ... there's been a lot of building of the of the rail up on the north side\nAnd and to some degree out out to the east side and the south side in the west side have not seen an equal commitment and I'm at right I'll let you sort of use your words about you know sort of projecting how we're going to have ... in the future versus responding to the crisis but um [noise]\n... you know again it's hard to say you're ... you're building an equitable\nSystem you know when in fact you probably are but there's development on the west side but I just had a conversation with Joel Bowman from urban creek partners this week yeah that's that's not just in spring up overnight so he was and we know about development that that's happening over there and if it's\nAnd what's going to happen again and all of September ... have been talking about it from what TI wants to do the other folks so\nIt's not like it was a surprise where they're not going to be development on the west side the right\nOf West the extension of the ...\nLon mix a lot of sense um it's the shortest lined by far of martyrs existing lines\nUm and it should at least go to the industrial area where there are a lot of jobs and to the river and prepare for some future where Cobb County buys into the system\nAnd then the ... of course a up through bank cut and beyond was intentional ... was supposed to extend into where a lot of this new growth or the west side park and an arid north up all of a bolt in an old out\nSo you know those are definitely things that we should be talking about who should have\nBeen advocating for that side of town where there because I had a gate if it were to melt in line with what you do write though who should have been on that are advocating for the Marta is not well it's really it's it's it's the city\nYou know because at the end of the day the mayor and the city council or the ones who are supposed to be ... you know listening to citizens looking at all the planning documents\nThinking about our cities budget and how we move forward in coming forward with a vision\nAnd and ... now we have plenty of plans all over the city for the west side from the south side the problem we have is that we go through all these planning situations and then the next new shiny object comes along we throw all the money at that um like when the when the bell with Cory park is\nComplete it then all of a sudden there'll be an interest in putting it is that what you're saying\nThe example anything you know just thinking about it I mean the belt line is a great example right you know there was some enthusiasm about it and then you know it's kind of like well and then we'll just sort of trickle the money at it and then beat him up when they don't do the things that got problems but\nAll of a you know to your question about you know I'm we're advocating for about one who should be advocating for these other things\nActually don't think that we should have had to advocate for about one in the scenario I think that I mean citizens generally should be advocating for the things that we are doing and we're should be going attending does public meetings and all that but to go above and beyond and create this whole new\nGroup of people who were fighting and working really hard to grassroots kind of way to support this vision\nShouldn't really be necessary because of the the project list in my opinion should reflect all the planning that's been done for the last Twenty years and development has been\nAn enormous part of that has had an enormous public engagement larger perhaps than any other project in the city's history and the project was should reflects out and when we realize that it wasn't going to reflect the\nBecause we have that particular interest and that's all we obviously all mobilized\nFor the ... and you but I certainly wouldn't allow that other ... as well well let's talk about about lying because they committed suicide when you say you know what we didn't get everything we want but we got something is better than nothing\nYou say you didn't get everything you want what did you I wanted to relate to that that quarter to particularly southeast corner because you've got a little bit of something\nYeah well we want it all seriously I mean we want twenty two miles a transit and a loop connecting the Marta all over the city as fast as we can get it that was from the original concept Ryan you're you're\nThat's up from the first day I mean what people have lost sight of as the fact that this was a transit plan from day one\nIt was not a park expansion plan and you know other things it was an art it was housing and what was transit oriented in housing in economic development around this twenty two mile loop and how we are the city densely without destroying neighbor connecting all of those and they are\nAnd not only that it's the trans with is the reason that we got this far\nI mean we wouldn't be talking about about one today if it wasn't about trends that and the reason why is because in two thousand five we passed the ... district that was based on the transit coming and the communities and south and west Atlanta in particular they thought the park and trail and all that was cute and nice but\nThey really wanted and I remember this vividly because I was living there at the time or they want to translate that access into the regional system to get jobs whether it's down to the airport or downtown or perimeter sooner or whatever else and so the transit is the thing that connects them into the system\nAnd really meaningful way that's really designed for everybody and if we had a ... that had it been the case then we wouldn't have passed the test which means the project would have been shelved and we'd been collecting dust for the last ... years\nThe Clifton court or\nAnd obviously that's a whole 'nother discussion but you look at the Clifton court or you look at the downtown street car industry car there's more\nMoney allocated for that than it is the Clifton court or the belt line it'd be really clear a lot of the money for the belt line just for the streetcar ... because it's fight with the ... of the five hundred and Seventy million mhm you're saying the part of that is more going to the street called extending the streetcar okay I get to the belt find\nIt hard to I I imagine I won't speak for you but that's a problem for you [noise] well it it you know when when the streetcar never had any ridership that is true from the beginning to now so there's no surprises about what's\nGoing on I have great misgivings about whether making a train that doesn't have any writers longer\nWill get writers me that as it may we spend a hundred million dollars on it but we worry and from the beginning that this would create a problem for transit on the belt line\nBecause people would look at that and go oh that's all I Want to connect with about was it will connect with the bill and then that's where most of the money's going to is to make those connections with about life and so as a result you're losing\nTheir really wrote bust connections and the planning for density that going that\nGoing around it rather than across it would get you\nNow that's a that's done ... right that's done it yet but I'm just being clear about my my perception of it right too much money for street car you're much attention\nWell you know I think it would be different or it depends on what the design of that is a big challenge for the street cars to get stuck in traffic no it doesn't have to be\nBut only could my producer Kansas women are over last month we could have been taken out with them we could've been taken out by the streetcar Candace Wheeler my producer we're over there and it was distraught\nYou mean that almost run you over or well well there's a [laughter]\nI mean maybe then you're thankful it's got stuck in traffic style and Tom I don't know but you know the but the beauty of the villain is that it's free flowing and when you look at all the traffic congestion and density that will certainly becoming not only to the dough and but also to downtown [noise]\nUm you know we need transit that's free flowing and and the belt wine and ... and if it if it's if it's connected physically it to the existing streetcar than the belt one is also stuck in traffic which means it's not going to be delivering the\nMobility that we've been talking about on as designed so that the idea for the ... what is going to end tomorrow so you would write it a little bit further south and conduct undergo smarter lawn into downtown\nToo big to be managed properly writer to trust\nI think he was not expecting that a few weeks after he said that statement he would have an enormous data breach where they can't be trusted to serve a to serve their users with their data so uh I Am not convinced that they still deserve to serve their users especially after\nThe past two years of really damaging news from them but it's still one of those convenience trade offs and I also don't think millions of people are going to just stop using them at least overnight so\nWhat can I have to wait and see if people actually log back in or not\nLike I think as a reporter at the New York times since news of the ... broke Irish privacy regulators who are in charge of enforcing Europe's sweeping data regulations have launched an official probe into whether Facebook did do enough to protect users if not a one point six billion dollar fine is on the table [noise]\nEm Ali what a mess marketplace sex [noise]\nThis is eight PM support for WABC comes

there's\nA lot to unpack here but I Want to begin with this ... and and that is where we are now the confirmation process and it's headed to the Senate floor for a full vote any surprises here regarding the procedural vote page\nOr know that not to me I'm Murkowski apparently voted against it or I'm not sure why she didn't simply just go ahead and vote to take it to the full Senate and didn't vote against him um it's still possible we may see someone like Senator Collins change that vote to uh no I don't think Jeff Flake is going to based on what we heard\nSo no I didn't think anything was surprising about that until\nAbout you surprises yet for the procedure was going to be interesting right 'cause you're up for fifty one forty nine or you have um two possible at least one strong no um and then you know you still have Joe which might change his vote as well so that would shut the entire vote to forty nine fifty one against once it goes for the full vote to read it\nWhen I'm not surprised not surprised has given the dynamics and the optics now professor ...\nNo I'm not surprised I Would have been been more surprised had it not proceeded to to a full vote in the Senate I think that was inevitable\nProgress let me stay with you because I Want to get your thoughts and I'll start with you do you believe the FBI the additional investigation and I use that because some people call it an additional vindication to really change them as soon as mines here at all professor\nUm well I think it's hard to know I I think it's certainly gave some senators\nI'm a bit more of a comfort level about going forward it at least gives the\nUm ability to to take away one of I I think the more effective talking points that the Democratic senators used at the hearing\nWhich was why aren't we even having a more objective bodies look at this we're not the right people to be to be trying to parse this out [noise] um so I think in that sense it could have increased people's comfort level um I'm not sure that out\nCertainly at the in the end of the day it will have changed any votes read or what about you\nI'm just curious as to the depth of it so with the president being the the the side or the arbitrator house full of an investigation the FBI was going to to complete I Do wonder what was in that report\nToo and it seems to have changed some people's minds to to vote to push forth to the nomination so it does seem to have may have made a difference yes Antonio yeah I\nAgree with a lot of that you know it's interesting that um\nI run a business right and uh when I'm going through the interview process of if I see some red flags you know I I'll look into it to make sure that um hiring the right person so [noise] um\nBecause it's not very transparent as far as the process is concerned I mean the the legislators had to go down stairs into pretty much a bunker\nTo look at the paperwork nothing has been made public we have no way of knowing exactly how deep the investigation when exactly what were they looking into what were they not looking into how many leaves actually existed that they never actually investigated further to find out what the truth really is\n... and turn to you you you do an investigation is all the time you know what we talk about the FBI's additional investigation didn't matter you\nKnow I don't think it mattered a and this is not a traditional FBI investigation and understand it is a background investigation which\nBy its very nature is going to be much more limited than a criminal investigation and that's what really bothered me I think about the expectations people had about what what happened during the course of this supplemental FBI investigation I mean we heard Senator Flake say look\nI've heard Dr Ford I find that she is compelling incredible but there's no corroborating evidence here to support that\nWell the FBI investigation was not going to find corroborating evidence is not designed or set up to do that\nI wrote an opinion taste or CNN dot com basically saying you know Senator Flake if you want to give a judge Kavanaugh this presumption of innocence that's fine but understand that that doesn't normally occur in a sex crime investigation there's not always going to be corroborating evidence is specially if you're going to interview only nine people so\nI don't think it changed any minds ah I think if anything a professor Iran is correct it may have solidified some votes for Kavanaugh but it didn't change and\nWell let me stay with you and we'll start this question here then do you think that that should be made public or should have been made public prior at is a good\nQuestion what I think should have happened and I know some Democratic senators requested this some of those witnesses should've testified in public before the Senate Judiciary committee specifically mark judge\nI I don't think as a general rule and FBI investigation that those interview notes should be made public but if it's something this material and the senators wanted to hear from him and presumably he may have wanted to testify or at least would have been required to under subpoena\nI think the public should have heard his lived testimony\nUnder oath professor ring up ring hand when you think\n[noise] um I agree I I I think making background FBI background checks public um is not necessarily a path that we want to go down I think that has some presidential value that's not necessarily good\nUm but I fear that what has happened here is that fact the fact that it's not a great idea to make these things public\nHas landed us in the worst of all possible worlds where the public has very little independent ability to evaluate um the information that may or may not be in that background check\nSo um I I think a in in in a better process um and hopefully one of the things that will come out of this is perhaps we can have a better process agreed to in advance before anyone knows who sides anyone's going to be on\nBut in a better process you know maybe one thing we could have seen was a bipartisan public release of a summary of the information that the\nMajority member and the ranking member signed on to something like that that that gave a little more\nUm reliability because now we're just in a world where we we have a you know biased link leaks coming out of every every side and tell you what do you think about that investigation\nYeah I mean I think you know the end of the day the sad part about all this is that it goes to the credibility of the court right and if there's one check on all power I'm In the United states as a Supreme Court and if we're gotten to a point where we no longer can actually\nUh you know believe in what's coming out because of the fact that something is so rushed to the point that uh we don't really look into a all the facts that that could be president in our president um it just takes the credibility away it goes back almost too are you going back in his you're now you're starting to hear the idea of\nOf a pack into court in the future you know someone else gets to like they were going to increase the number of judges it route to me it goes back to almost Nineteen thirty seven you know the switch in time the J has an I\nWear a justice is allowed to take it upon themselves to change the way they were voting because they were
