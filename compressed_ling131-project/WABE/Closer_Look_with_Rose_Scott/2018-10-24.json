for NPR\nHas always I'm Rose Scott those pushing for efforts to create the proposed city of eagles landing say you know it's about creating an identity to partisanship we'll have more than that in a moment no matter which side of the controversy you're on the legal battle between the proposed city of eagles landing and the existing city of Stockbridge continues\nAnd so we continue with the city of Stockbridge mayor Anthony for who joins means to you come back to a closer look\nLimit on how you doing Rove I'm fine how are you doing just fine defined glad to be here once again let's begin here in for our listeners who may not know what this is all about and let's listen to the other side about the need to create the city of eagles landing take all the city\nHit is about a lot of things and I didn't community identity as a as a big part of it because you know when you\nWith all of these cities you know Sandy Springs it was noted as Sandy Springs ... before Sandy Springs that you knew you were gonna Brookhaven at the same thing you have that community identity which is very very important to folks that lived there but it it it it does it brings on that identity but\nFor example we had someone who is\nThe city council Stockbridge who is a real it's real estate broker and they lifted their property or as being an eagles landing and he goes in and out of the city why did they do that because I knew the identity they want the identity and they want the press stage that goes along supposedly\nNow that is Vicki ... chairs the eagles landing educational research community ... response you've been hearing that from the beginning to now right all part of identity\nAnd well the thing about it is is that a parts of eagle lander insidious ... British regardless of that aspect and I would think that it remained but to the city has its own identity very diverse community itself\nAnd and because it's very diverse you'd have different ethnic backgrounds and economic backgrounds of individuals' period and so and we wanted to capture established at it and expand on that where's that were city for all people\nAll all races all concerns all all diversity and uh and we're going to do what we can end up in the future now and in the future as we get over this particular speed bumps as I call it to do what we can for all the citizens out rightly\nLet's talk numbers here right now in the city of Stockbridge what does your population route twenty thousand and what the proposed city of eagles landing rather than about\nSome all there'd be about nine thousand and we'd be taken out of the city limits that this occurs but uh I'll I'll tell you it's not going to occur the citizens are going to I'm going to make sure that this doesn't happen they're going to vote this thing down and keep the city completely no\nThat that's that's very you sound very confident but considering that a good portion of Stockbridge won't be able to vote on the referendum you're counting on those who remain or who live and quote the ... area of eagles landing to\nAbsolutely ended up there are there's a small there's an element of folks that are in the Pacific a designated area that can vote\nOr that have indicated that they don't plan to support this this particular city hood initiative and they plan to stay inside ceiling stop present and you also have people that are on a corporate county area they'll get an opportunity to vote\nAnd do what I'm also here and what are those numbers in that area well just about six thousand or so in that area\nBut there are six thousand won't vote last correct but then again six on residents I don't know the actual numbers for the actual voting population but the point of it is is that what I hear is that a lot of those folks don't want to be in the city of stop Brits nor be in the city of eagles landing so the voted down as well\nThe recent ruling from the judge that said look this referendum Wilkins ten you will happen and obviously you all were opposed to that because not all of the residents all the voters eligible voters will be able to vote which you also it was problematic because\nWhy would you vote to carve out a section of the city to create another city if the only ... the currency and you can vote\nAbsolutely not and I'm One of those individuals that they cannot vote in this particular and this is where I live in the northern part of a Stockbridge itself and yes to the uh they decided to both the the federal court as well as the Georgia Supreme Court indicated they would not stop the referendum but yet of the ways they still alone is a decision in reference\nTo the merits of the case that still yet to come in that aspect and the judge did go on to enter ruin as it relates to the municipal debt and I want to get some clarity on that as relates to these bond so these bonds were issued in two thousand and five and two thousand six an amount exceeding about Seventeen million dollars right\nSo what this really now you've ... let's say if the eagles landing does become a city okay they are going to be responsible for a certain portion of the the debt that we owe to Capitol lawn and that'll be proportionate to the amount of parcels\nThat are taken out of the city compared to what is still remain in cities would understand however though those the proponents for the city of eagles landing at ... didn't inaccurately misled the voters because they\nSaid this one yeah that's right indicated that ah that would be no property tax and the Senate and by the federal judge his response and and and uh that was written up in order there they would be some type of tax associated with this\nAnd I will tell you rose that individuals that are inside the city right now do not have a property tax so those those individuals that don't have a property tax it would be kind of crazy to now knowing this would kind of say yes I Want to be a city knowing that you would have a property taxes that you put on yourself and\nThose that are in the county that do not have a city property tax because they're not in the city and then they will be opposing the potential is a property tax on themselves as well\nAnd these bonds correct me if I'm wrong therefore because these bonds are part of redevelopment for the city correct with any of that redevelopment going to take place in the area known as the eagles landing\nUh as far as I Know at this point I Would say not know so they would be on the hook for developing there's not even happening here said here's the thing roasted ... you're talking about the economic or do that they want to take\nYou to even find a parkway and that is that is the funding that revenue to franchise fees that support to stop personnel allows us to have no city property tax for the citizens in the entire city\nSo when you want to take that away it causes a problem and how we're going to run our particular city we're losing ... five million dollars of the revenue and while our budget is operating but there's little nine million\nFor what it is in your opinion from your viewpoint is this really about identity and partnership\nNo I Would say no obviously not abide a dentist I don't I don't think that at all I think it's just about the\nFolks that that that may have been in power before I wanted to be in power again folks about economic development about doing the best for the particular area\nAnd we're ... the city the cursor to count for myself I'm working on the economic development piece we just recently hired a new economic director and we're still we still have to go south which is highly ... road and that is still working and that will take off as soon as we get over this particular ...\nWe've heard both sides here in in even folks concerning that are concerned with the whole process of creating new cities and I asked\nAttorney Mike Bowers is yesterday in terms of the role that journals simply place or some people think that it's okay that this is the legislative body that makes the decision because often that gets the ball rolling on whether or not a city will become a city\nAnd some say you know we're really just leave them vote have a simple vote and leave it up to the residents what\nWould you prefer well that that's one other one thought process but I Will tell you the process that they're having a general assembly is a process that probably still work you gotta realize that the designated area of eagles landing\nUp that was it was drawn out by individuals and pushed by a local legislation but it never went to talk to those individuals in that doesn't it is whether it's part of Stockbridge with power part of on a corporate county area\nIf you would have done that initially and talk to those folks you may have forgotten a feel for what was going on whether or not those folks want to be part of city are not\nIn a process that that you do if you do that did it take to the legislative process and you coordinate with the county and city where that those areas stand then that's the proper process to go about but that was circumvented and this aspect\nEthnicity and science fiction and future and comics and superheroes and all that and here's a question what tickets alone that is in there for a long time\nWell what took it so long is just very ... it's like kind of like hip hop I'm not a hip hop person but I Do understand and respect you know how to hip hoppers I Am not no no I Know I got to get all our own but what it is is that what I Am is I'm\nA creative and hip hop is creative and so what happens is like any form that comes from black community where\nJazz hip hop R B that is generally merged into the larger ... a a national and didn't world culture because you can make money off of it [noise]\nWhen did manage rocket start managed rockets started back in the Nineteen nineties uh I was working in the comic book industry at that time\nAnd I wanted to come up with a concept\nA that was an alternative paths and back then I called the alternative pass course now we know what his diesel funk uh um which did there many practitioners of it now I like Milton Davis\nA and what I'm doing with Matt he's rocket is trying to do something that allows people of color of a certain age to get that thing they didn't get when they were younger let's talk about your journey\nAnd Tim ... on this journey did you often see people that looked like you in the industry in space and now and I imagine you'd probably see more people of color and ... obviously more women too but along the journey confidence you see people that look like\nYeah I actually I Am very fortunate in debt in comics do always been black geeks\nUh it's just that now we're sexy back then we were not say a bet on the shirt right that's right they these were the guys who who didn't get the girls now I didn't see as many women at the time but uh I'm happy to
