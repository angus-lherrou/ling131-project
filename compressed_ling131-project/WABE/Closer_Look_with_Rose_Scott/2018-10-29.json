shoot other denominations they should also lead the conversations I in their own houses of worship I think\nWe're in in such a challenging difficult place that we need to have the faith leaders and civic leaders and business leaders we've come to a place where a nothing is more important in our country right now than ah this this uh opportunity to end or this hatred and violence\nAnd you know our nation as a history of violence targeting houses of worship bombings mass shootings you just mentioned the couple you think about three years ago a manual Amy and South Carolina you think about the twenty six people that were killed at the first Baptist church in rural southern springs\nWhen people are targeting houses of worship what does that say to you though because they're specifically targeting these areas where they know people probably are not carrying weapons but it's a house of worship does that speak to some deep\nIt does hatred yeah says this is the most evil kind of evil that ever is or was\nA to walk into it to a group of people praying or had to have that kind of hatred um is is the worst kind of evil and this is being prosecuted as it should as a hate crime or a so so I so I agree with that sentiment\nI Know you don't probably want to talk about security measures but even here with President Trump said that perhaps maybe if if there was armed security there it might prevent it just ... of this incident but as of as a senior rabbi at the temple you have to concern yourself with the ... and\nWe take our security very seriously and as you said we're not able to discuss it ah but um it's something that we have always taken very seriously and uh I I reject the notion that that uh someone standing with a gun that's the answer particularly because there were police officers or who did have weapons that were injured\nOr so I reject that notion and there are a or a smaller congregations all over this country that will not be able to uh to to do that so the the that's not the answer\nWhat is your message to your congregants or again to the community at large and\nYou want to be able for people to worship you want people if you have a right to feel the way they feel if they are angry if they're upset but how do you ... your rabbi and leader of your ...\nHow do you navigate through all that and your own personal feelings I mean you you you were emotionally while I'm not saying I mean back up on on projected on you\nBut you're correct which has been one of the most difficult periods\nYou've got to be ... or you also have to reconcile with whatever you dealing\nAnd we support each other we have a a a large a clergy team in our congregation and we spend time supporting each other and a pastor into each other and and caring for each other\nAnd that is true of the of the interfaith community here there are so many ministers and e moms and rabbis in Atlanta um that that are part of my inner circle really part of my family and uh and and we ...\nEach other at I think that all of us are going to share a very similar message with our communities\nThis weekend or in churches and mosques and synagogues and you'll have a visual plan is well we have a vigil planted a twelve thirty on Tuesday Afternoon and of course will be a adding special prayers of remembrance at our regular Shabaab worship this Friday evening as well\nPredatory bird we are in a political climate in elections coming up but how do you navigate through all of that and trying to stay out of the politics of it but do you get a message to your kind of gets about not just say who to vote for but\nMaybe they get a little deeper in terms of which candidate to support\nWhy I Do tell everyone to vote all the time it's it's so important that every whoever you whoever you want to vote for being every ... or so I I don't feel that it's my role to um to endorse candidates I'm I feel that it's my role as a rabbi ... to make sure everybody votes for whoever they want to vote for\nA bit be to work very strongly on the issues so what I Do is develop a relationship with political ah and civic leaders of all parties in all background so that when an issue arises um I can I have a relationship and I'm able to work with them\nUh and and I this is something that I'll be doing in the coming days is working with a members of all political parties to make sure that we address these issues of anti Semitism and gun violence\nAnd ah that are all around us and security\nAs we wrap up and I know they have you been in touch with some people up in Pittsburgh TV who he still ... what'd you say\nWe've spoken to some of the leaders of the community and Pittsburgh to offer our profound condolences\nSometimes there's very little that one can say a except to say that that we love them and we're here for them in Atlanta not just the Jewish community but Atlanta stands behind them in with them\nOr in their grief a and that we will roll up our sleeves and work everyday to create a better world for our children and our children's children\nI Can't tell you how many times and I know that you have to have seen is raising we're in a divided nation you know our nation is divided liberal can safely just playing on this\nOur obligation it's not just a role it's an obligation I'm used to uh not only\nPreach the truth and to speak truth to power to the members of our communities but it is to meet with our elected officials because we have there here and to help them a move the needle to create a better society and\nTo move the needle to create a better society DC that that is something that can happen here\nI Do it last night as the city that's too busy to hate we're the city of the civil rights movement\nOr we are a city where the religious leaders are not only get along with each other but truly love each other if anyone can do it it's Atlanta my faith is a hundred percent behind us all and I look forward to working with our

going to give people facts and you all that is your job to to track in and make sure you all have the facts\nUm I only here for the love of my people but the other side of that coin is this inherent violence of removing all people who are quote unquote white from that society\nHas you reflect on what happened this past week in in in Pittsburgh what are your thoughts\nIt's devastating I mean it's it's it's feeling a all too common in this day and age that we are that we're going\nDoes this tragedy over and over again I mean I think that just to a couple of years or what happened in Charleston and breaks my heart that you know we're continuing to see violence at the scale in this country\nYou mentioned Charleston South Carolina and then the young men Dylann Roof and then it was noted that you know here's a young man that was being infiltrated with all this information and what Nineteen twenty yeah that's so young\nWell it speaks to you know how effective this propaganda can be especially for disaffected youth I mean one of the things that's most disturbing about what we saw during Rufus he seems to have done it basically by himself on line\nAnd I you know I just want to take something to say the tech companies have to do more you know we're working to try to get them to make some policy changes um you know someone called changed the terms of basically they have to take this problem more seriously\nWhat do you mean for example if if there's someone at the at is posing with guns or\n... that would be a fantastic first start particularly if it's an a threatening manner with rhetoric but I'm Talking even out of basic level they don't seem to be able to get a handle of hate groups were have leaders even being on the platforms if you can't even deal with that explosive problem how can we even begin to deal with this kind of rising tide of toxicity that we're talking about all too often now\nHosting company may say well look we have terms they read them they they agree to the terms you know but the end of the day that they are they making money and so if someone has a website where they're paying a certain amount for you know for that site to be hosted is hosting company then saying look we've done all we can we can do so you can't hold his responsible [noise]\nYeah I mean you can you can hear that argument and you do sometimes from some of these companies but I Would turn around and say you know is there not some moral responsibility that they that they bear for hosting that content in for allowing it to be reached by all these people you know there are an essential part of how the infrastructure exists\nBut going beyond just someone posting some language or some narrative there haven't broken any laws and you understand the argument\nI can understand that argument but I also think that these companies have a responsibility to make a choice at take a stand\nEach year you all put out the hate report um and I imagine each year it hasn't changed much in terms of the the thickness of the magazine but uh how do you well\nHow do you decide if then this issue which has all these organizations in it if this issue is accurate number one and then number two that you also aren't\nGiving people information where they can find these hate groups\nWell we weigh that carefully when we write about it and you know this is where you know context and details are so important you know we spend so much time\nTracking these groups and tried to contextualize them in meaningful ways and we have a variety of audiences law enforcement among them um that we try to get this information to so that they can take it in their local communities and be aware you know I think many times a awareness is that first step and knowing that it's
