Atlantic Station you couldn't have torn down to Atlantic Station the old a steel mill and\nJust started building you had to cap all that environmental hazard in this case it's similar\nYou you have to raise this up to the viaduct level that it is today because you cannot amalgam made all that land and then come up a ... it's it's impossible it's so many so many can stretch of railroads running through the a martyr running through it you have a right of ways conceded to various entities so\nYou have to build this platform with a platform becomes their land\nSo there's two most expensive parts of this or to pay for their land okay we said about ... ... ah parcels which is approximately two hundred million dollars\nThen it costs somewhere not shirt to build up the platform build some streets and so forth somewhere four or five hundred million dollars I don't think they're in their numbers that they're not\nUm you know who knows exactly the precise and stuff that so they have to spend about six to seven hundred million dollars now that kinda money doesn't grow on trees with any developer and so you have there's there's few people in this country that could do something\nLike that I don't think anyone would argue that incentives in tax breaks are key in luring has an ad in there I Want to say that that shouldn't happen but you know ha it's at the core of this also as we go back to that one point seven billion and you look at\nWhat needs to happen particularly let's just focus on a PS for a minute ride with schools and you and I both know that the school system that educate said roughly maybe eighty percent of the students are on free or reduced lunch which is an economic indicator for those are living at or below the poverty level\nAnd I was listening what documentary of course often said it's as in terms of as it relates to the task and the problems that this will be a additional financial burden on the district\nWe have our own priorities kids come first ... support them our second\nThird in line are our tax payers so I've got fifty thousand kids six thousand employees and a hundred and fifty a dish thousand tax payers and what we're able to do when you open your tax bill and you see how much it costs you'll see that a PS is the largest portion of your bill\nThe only way I can help a homeowner\nIn addition to helping kids is to be able to address that nearly trade so I can reduce their tax bill so yes it's about kids yes it's about the staff but it's also about the taxpayer\nWho is expecting us to be responsible to ask tough questions to make sure we're not putting an undue burden on them because make no mistake if the money isn't being paid for right now in the tag someone else is paying for it and they live outside the tad\nHere we go attach thrived talked about this and there are ten times as well I've been to save it landed a PS is participates in five\nAge I could deal get done with out having to one either extend that west side tad or can you understand the superintendents part because it's another additional right financial burden on this district\nLet me just first address the or the tab issues in general ... in because I think that's that's something that has been around the community for a while [noise]\nTax allocation districts or to financing our best practice and economic development across the country that's true and they are particularly framed around trying to solve difficult infrastructure problems without a public entity stroking a check up front\nIn order to fix it so in in this case is no different the taxes that\nUm aren't there there's no sales tax there today there is very very limited property tax so we're Maria and I may differ is\nShe's talking about she's losing money but that money doesn't exist today it has to be created by the developer and they have to borrow that one\nThey create for twenty twenty five years or Thirty years and then it revert back now you know all about yeah I asked her that too and\nSo when I think her um comment Israeli referring to historical problem that she's looking at from the five pads which\nIs that money didn't exist when it started now exist in produce those results I agree with her I have no problem with looking at uh all the ads and the policies and in fact even on this deal I think there's a deal in here for\nA PS that'll solve some of their that the problems of of loaning money to the developer so to speak\nMuch like the belt line deal was in the ... where is it the ... well they haven't got the problem in this situation is there's nothing to talk about in the city council votes for this deal in ...
