rail network\nIn downtown Atlanta to allow that development to happen give me an example well uh do you think that um folks would wanting to be in in investing in the Gulch if\nFive points rail station wasn't it didn't happen to be right next to it um underground Lana the the the development that's happening between\nA five points in garden that station that area is transforming Georgia State is clearly part of that but transportation is clearly a piece of that\nAnd transit is a is really robust and that you know piece of the city\nYou don't think there will be development still taking place if there was it was some connection to a martyr transit stations you don't think the developments still would've occurred\nI don't think it would be as robust and I don't think it would be happening as quickly as we see it happening you know I always think about uh as I fly into the city\nSo much of our development is just right along the court orders of our transit system in in in downtown and midtown Atlanta now the wrote the road systems there as well and that's a big piece of it as well but development happens around transportation\nLet me ask you a stand given that and we're going to dig into this year or more in Atlanta given what you just sit there and look at the west side there's no plans for heavy rail and there's development popping up all on the west side we're talking about this on the last thirty days so why no real expansion for the west side you know we have\nTo really come up with a\nConstrained program lesson and there is you know we are investing in the west side with us more Marta program and we can get into that you know we have there'd be Archie quarter there that we're investing in as well as a candle to an wrote on the west side so significant investment on the west side\nYeah but when you think of cameras in road and you think you're right it's on the west side but they're the other side there is there's a lot of\nDevelopment happening and if you can't get people out there that want to they need jobs or you know if the developers urban creek partners' partners yeah a lot of development taken place and you don't have\nA way for people to get people want to take the train cars yeah folks don't want to get on a bus sometimes is it'd be really clear ms ... you don't have real going out to you know you have plans were able to go out there and you and I both know that the west side is gonna be it's going to explode already exploding\nIt is and we need to find ways this this region and the city needs to find ways to invest in the west side and and all over metro Atlanta to allow that development tap\nSo you need input from the city of Atlanta to help\nNo I you know I think we've got substantial important input from the city of Atlanta about where to make these investments with this program what I'm saying is that [noise]\nYou know we started with a program list that was eleven billion dollars you and I could sit down and quickly increase at eleven billion dollars and you just fired off some of them we could probably come up with twenty thirty billion dollars worth of investment\nAnd when did you just tell me before we came over on the air you said that he Seattle Seattle ... billion dollars\nForty billion dollar investment ... in transit in transit yeah not transportation just just transit\nOr Los Angeles hundreds of billions of dollars investment in transit so you know we we've got to work with what we have\nAnd that's what we're focused on today in terms of advancing a transfer program but you know going back to what you ask me at the beginning this can't be considered the only by to the apple we're not going to continue to grow as a city\nAnd a region if we're not investing in infrastructure\nThe way that feeds the way we need to feed that growth\nMy which you could do if he had forty billion absolutely you know the original project list it was criticized because especially for those who are advocating for trans on them and in the end it did make it onto the project lifts\nYou all know that the important of having transit along the mountain and how do you see that being crucial for this overall the overall future of Marta had any transit now advocates wanted transit all around the twenty two mile loop how do you see that line fit in\nWell you know let me back up and say you talked about that the project list was criticized we started with an eleven billion dollar list and have you do now to to point seven billion dollars worth of expected revenue so of course we weren't going to make everybody everybody happy and we took a ... you know we took a lot of time\nIn outreach I think it was from artist perspective lose pretty historic ... was\nIt was reaching out at board meetings and talking to people it was working with city council it was all sorts of outreach that got us to that proposed list\nAnd then we did additional out outreach over the past two or three months to really make sure that we were in alignment with what the the voters and what the people in the city thought was important and I think we did a great job with that now\nIt didn't mean that we ... we have the ability to fund the entire belt line and I think there's some you know there's some real a technical challenges with the belt line that\nAs far as Marta will need to deliver these projects the you know for example um there's a real desire to fund that South east quadrant of outline well the next\nQuarter mile half mile mile is a tunnel and nobody's gone through any environmental process today\nThere's there there are some some concepts of what could be done with a tunnel some concepts of what could be done by accessing stations are\nIn men park king memorial and bypassing pieces of ah you know of that tunnel and so we've got real technical challenges that we need to figure out that we're at a concept level\nAnd that's you know what we're focusing on right now is trying to figure out what the best next step up the outline can be so that we can maximize that investment\nSo he's trying to figure out how do you do that\nWell the way we're going to do it is to look forward and talk to a put together a process to find if there are\nPublic private partnerships and it goes back to the original concept of the belt line if if you if you go you know way back in time machine when we were talking about the belt line before we had this funding source the belt line was going to be built\nBy leveraging the property values along the development so that's you know that's what we want to do we want to look at opportunities\nTo work with developers and maybe find opportunities to have pieces of a station built by a developer that would lower the cost and and really we need to maximize that investment I Believe the Marta board believes that the best\nThere's a great project all twenty two miles as well as such streetcar network with sort of ... that the belt line a B I laid out as in the city council approved as the belt lined street car plant\nLet's talk about the streetcar sure and you all agree to take over operation of the ... ...\nHow do you see first of all getting the public to\nGet on board so to speak with the with the streetcar you have to expand it because it's a very short route as of right now\nAnd you know complaints about all the streetcar got stuck or the streetcar hit my car all that you know ... how do you see the expansion of the street car and and and and lay out for our listeners who may not know what that looks like\nYeah so so what is recommended and what we're moving forward with is an ex stench of the streetcar both east and west so east over the crowd market\nAnd then west by the Georgia world Congress center a major note of you know of demand for\nFor people who visit and live in the city\nAnd then continuing on over through the ... center where there are thousands of students and then eventually you know connecting to the belt line so we would have a court or an east west court or that connects one side of the belt line through the ... center\nGeorgia world Congress through the existing streetcar system that we have today and then over the crowd market and I think the importance of this is is that if you think about particularly in mid town in downtown some of the most\nDifficult travel is east west so we need to work with the city to come up with ways to prioritize\nYou know travel time on the street car and make sure that it gets priority over over automobiles and we're going to work through these issues and make it more\nYou know a quicker ride and a A N and reaching more places I think that's fundamentally when you build the first piece of a system you're not connecting it to the larger network\nBut that investment industry car system will truly connected to the entire transit\nNow you know ... you're going to get feedback when he said did he just said prioritize a streetcar over the eagles yes I did\nI tell them send emails [laughter] let's let's let's look at this because this this plan does include a lot of projects Mr Parker how you are prioritized nice price I Know there are some things you all already implementing it relates to the bus routes um but as far as these big major project prioritize\nUh

up around that area\nA morale of the Republican side ah this was a huge them into this ah for Republicans this was going to get them to the polls and eventually ah keep the house keep us\nBut did did it entered does this energized your particular demographic if they were talking about in terms of millennials\nI Would say most definitely um you know seeing are seeing our values\nAre being a protected seeing what we care for being protected seen the rule of law actually are being applied fairly uh you know in this country we believe that you know and it's and it's been proven guilty\nUm there there were no facts ... cooperating and it's just for a ... um there were\nThere was never in a moment um during these seven FBI investigation that he went through um that suggested that there were any wrongdoing on his part so the ... the rule of law\nThe innocent until proven guilty um and just finally\nRepublicans getting a bat bones um is really something that\nMy generation as excited about\nJake what do you think [noise] yeah um I I think there is no doubt that right now we we do have a very polarized electorate a from a political standpoint I mean I just I don't think anyone can deny that a\n... a bit of reassurance in my opinion in this kind of goes from the initial video we had already had older people are speaking as millennials are the most diverse generation American history\nAnd I say this very frequently were were a generation that\nHas been exposed to people that look different than us from people that are different backgrounds and we are and and I agree with a Porsche were were more tolerant or two people that are that are different and I think hopefully long term\nThat makes the discourse be different than it currently is and to me that's not a political issue\nI I don't think that it's a political issue to say that we shouldn't find middle middle ground we shouldn't have discussions like this ... with people who don't agree with us on every political issue but at the end of the day I think that's going to\nBreak down differences because this is most important to note all humans have far more similarities and differences and if they come to the table and talked about issues\nI think that they will reach the best conclusion long term you think about the current temperature political temperature of the nation\nOr not to return to a couple of things that were the ... already I think I'm back to porches point I think was very um specifically with elation to to the British have it on a nomination but also to um a lot of the trends in politics right now both the national um and then down onto the the state and local levels which are that the cabinet\nNominations brought up a particular issue Brett Kavanaugh was credibly accused of sexual assault by by three different women um as long as I said this\nNominated by President Trump who has been accused of sexual assault by I think sixteen Eighteen when something like that um these things didn't happen in isolation this was not a new\nIssue for us so since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke hum with last year and there have been many many I'm willing to move right the me too movement in time's up and all that right um so these things are happening in a ... a portion that we're becoming less tolerant of things like this will be means we built\nA certain amount of political momentum a certain amount of political force and awareness around these issues um which as many people have noted um have for very long time gone unaddressed I'm\nIn politics and I think that's another\nWay in which millennial voters are\nIncreasing in their engagement they're seeing things that we're we're the status quo I think we're a lot of millennials thought these are things that can't be changed this is just the way the world is\nAnd now we have these moments not just me too but black lives matter but a lot of other a vote of other groups that are now finding their voice and finding their power um who are who are making real change and I think that's that's the thing that's the\nThing that's going to spare millennials into greater political engagement is seeing their voices be heard and seeing their ability to make change\nLet me say from an air because among your groups ... what what conversations are you all having you you're out idiots encouraging people to register to vote if they haven't and asked him about what issues are important to them what do they tell you what are you hearing\nWell I think there is a I think it cuts into kind of two camps which also I'm as wherever they called substance and procedure on the substance side we've got a lot of the the bread and butter issues I think there's a lot of\nOf for lack of a better political imagination\nThat is is come into our generation so things like expanding health care access okay which for for a long time a lot of the old guard for lack of a better term is telling us see that's unrealistic that can't happen\nYou know it would be impossible for every single person in the country to have health care and I think we're kind of fed up and are saying no you know what we can okay um so that's one big issue but there's there's you know plenty and brought more but you hear and health care health care is definitely a big one especially because we have that policy fight earlier and then on the what I call the procedural side we have\nUm the current administration has fostered a culture of corruption I think his entire a significant portion of his cabinet as\nIs resigned in disgrace over you know from low level the high level graft and corruption and problems like that um and it goes all the way up in New York Times just\nAllege that President Trump had had committed in his career hundreds of literally hundreds of millions of dollars worth of my ex from his father right with money from his father and and through outright fraud and so I think people are concerned about that very deeply as well\nWhat issues what are you talking about the economy\nI mean it it is a young person\nOr when you're graduating from college or you want a job and unfortunately and environment you have now it's very difficult to food the student loan debt situation is very difficult to timely pay off that dead and so\nAh the the reality is for young people\nThey want the ability to ensure that their education their hard work their training comes in materialize as an opportunity to get a job and I think if you look at the numbers there's no doubt about the fact that the economy is in a status I'm really of a Supreme growth unemployment\nRate is is is that all time low stock markets at all time highs and that's due to fiscal conservatism principles less government\nLess regulation um creating an economic system which rewards hard work creativity or all of which are the this country was founded upon and all of which separate the United states of America from every other country in the world\nUm and so maintaining that velocity because at the end of the day\nIn and one thing about politics is\nThe analysts can break it down you know six ways to Sunday at the end of the day most voters look at ... am I better off today than I was yesterday\nWith people that have three kids that are making a household income uh fifty thousand or under they are concerned about the bottom line\nWhen they get to the ballot box despite you know all of the rhetoric that in my opinion it if you look at the voting trends is what's going to control and I think millennials are no different runaway think what are you where you are talking about what it is\nI Would have to agree with Eric on um on many topics or the economy is definitely one of them you know and and no one's concerned about justice Kavanaugh for Traub if they don't have a job or they're worried about paying their bills um and then for millennials in particular when I graduated college the first thing I thought about what the job\nOf uh before I graduate college the first thing I thought I was a job um and so I go to college to get a better job um and so I don't want free education\nI Want better economic opportunity or that I can apply might agree to 'em and then when I get that job I Want to make sure that I'm not paying higher taxes\nSo we're talking about taxes from about the economy we're talking about building wealth we're talking about establishing a community that fosters a healthy lifestyle um and just really the issues that mattered everyday people that are that did not watch Fox News or CNN [noise]\n... what are the issues you're only talking\nAbout um a lot of the same um but uh my friends are not consistently talk about a lot of the social issues and concerns that we have as well um my friends run the gamut from literally every social socio economic background you can think of\nUm and we are very concerned about each other and for our families and for our friends and for our nieces and nephews because none of us have kitchen because ... broke Tom [laughter] and about what kind of world we're leaving for um the people who are looking up to us um and how these elections are impacting Avon example those social issues we're talking about sure um so I have\nFriends that I as a particular community and they're concerned about how they're treated when they step out on the street every day and how maybe there are nieces and nephews or future children will be treated if they're allergic to Q. when they're in schools um we're concerned about whether or not um our\nI'm younger counterparts are going to be looking at um\nEven higher student debt than we have if they're going to be able to get a great enough education I'm even be able to get into these institutions of higher learning um what are they learning while they're in school it's it's very much an ongoing conversation about what our young people are people who are younger than us than these millennials will be I'm left with when we are going\nWell let's talk about the engagement process in terms of your group being engaged in the larger picture I mean do you all are from the Atlanta young Republicans and the young Democrats of Atlanta is your voice being hurt within the group respectively the political parties as a whole and if not\nI felt you know I was going to be All right thank you [noise]\nThe cost outweigh the public benefit\nThat we've been talking about but now into the importance of money from tax allocation districts or tax so in a nutshell\nA tad allowed the percentage of property taxes over specific amount of time to go towards projects for specific area it's pretty pretty simple it was a little history lesson there are tend to add to the city of Atlanta and counties also in the mix\nA PS participates in five of those tests we'll get to that moment which means that ... a district agrees to forego some of its money from property taxes to fund set project everybody follow me okay now\nEnter a P. S. and the ghost development deal which will require funding for maybe as his property taxes because adults will be develop inside the west side tad joining me in Studio down off of the school districts concerns is APO superintendent Dr ... thank you for coming into the\nTime thank you so much for give us an opportunity to educate our community about the ... and the effect on the school district\nLet's start from the beginning and work for it because he's a correct today PS is currently participating in the five times I mentioned that is true okay now I Know due to market activity the amount of money kicked in on an annual basis the changes right\nIt does it does but um since Nineteen Ninety nine when the tad started we put in about four hundred and thirty four million dollars and the five cats in which we participate they say the number again four hundred and thirty four million dollars since Nineteen Ninety nine since Nineteen Ninety nine of course none of the task of closed so we still have more to pay well\nWe'll get to the moment because I think what's important for our listeners to know that does the district actually get to recoup any of the money paid until the ...\nUh it's very little uh the the concept is that the tides actually have to finish being developed and then once they're closed\nThe concept is that then uh you're able to actually generate taxes that would allow for you to start making it back but as you can imagine you would it would take a couple of like a decade or so to be able to finally make yourself whole again and then really start benefiting\nI've heard the counter argument or opposition to that well you're not really missing any money technically I've heard people say that your what's your response\nUm that isn't true of course uh the state or doesn't see it that way we lose about sixteen million dollars and our local fair share\nAnd that's an immediate loss once the developments actually start happening on one of these tad geographic sites so the way the state sees a our school district and the tag is that you chose to be in them but they withhold five Neal's\nUm of what we could earn because\nThey you know believe that you made a different decision in your community but you are just going to have to ... they're going to withhold the money that would otherwise be coming to the system\nNow let's be fair because obviously the the a PS agreeing to participate and attach happened before you\nLong before you came on board correct so one would my aunt asked this question okay well is there somewhere in the contract where the district can ask that either we pay off the debt paid off are you close it if you feel like development has reached its peak for that said area for example let's look at it ... exactly\nExactly so um Atlantic Station is a perfect example it was an industrial waste land by most people's standards\nUm and so if it weren't they they call it a but for test\nA it would not be developed but for the designation of a tad and actually for what it's worth we support cleaning up blighted underdeveloped\nI'm depressed areas of our city\nThe challenges that what you're supposed to be doing with all the new revenue coming in to that to add is paying off the debt or the bonds inside the cat that hasn't been happening and because of that\nThings then start triggering like you'll extend the tab longer which means you're in it longer which means it will be a longer time period before you start seeing the benefit of what the spirit of the ... should have been doing from the beginning\nAnd let's be fair to because we can also point to something that's happened now I'm just here but across the nation to ten years ago which was the great recession when what nobody building anything right so right at vets and unforeseen unforeseen circumstances\nBut everyone knows and economy isn't strong forever so you can always in terms of pay a certain time period you're going to see some type of recession\nNow let's get to this go to a deal because there's a lot here to unpack when did the district first learned of this deal involving a C I Am group to develop the Gulch in wanting a PS two from what I understand to extend the west side was that part of the initial\nI Want to be clear like when when we were looking at all things a PS everything that we had inherited back in December\nOf a twenty Seventeen when people were running for office where there was a school board member city council member a mayoral candidate we brought our charge into for children it included talking about pads and wanting to go back and renegotiate some of these these contracts that weren't working in our favor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Closer Look with Rose Scott", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "10"}
