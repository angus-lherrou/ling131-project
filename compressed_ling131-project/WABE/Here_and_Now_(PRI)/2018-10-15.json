other states the government Accountability Office in partnership with the national\nCenter for Health Statistics is that what the results of a survey conducted in two thousand sixteen they surveyed low income adults ages Nineteen sixty four\nNotable findings include nearly twenty percent of poor people in states that did not expand Medicaid said they opted not to get medical care in previous

country Sears is now filing for bankruptcy NPR's David Schaper reports a chapter eleven filing maybe the last chance for the one hundred twenty five year old company to stay alive Sears\nLosses in recent years are staggering more than ten billion dollars it's two thousand twelve the company's debts are massive also in the billions\nThe suburban Chicago based parent company Sears Holdings as close more than seven hundred years in k-mart stores over the last two years under this bankruptcy planned the company will close another one hundred and forty two stores before the end of the year\nBut the company will get the financing it needs to keep about five hundred more stores opened through the critical holiday shopping season and beyond after losing many of its customers who the retailers like Amazon Sears is now pending it's survival lied reorganizing as a smaller version of itself\nAs well and actually you know we've been watching Sears sort of slow motion disaster for some time now are we remember that the Sears Tower in Chicago or used to be called the Sears Tower in Chicago now it's called the Willis Tower less ah but you wrote about this about a year ago and you use the phrase\nOr the Internet before the Internet when you were talking about how serious relied on male or to get customers that's\nExactly right mail the telegraph rail parcel delivery these were the technologies of the late Nineteen century that allowed Sears to become a store that was invisible right not a store that you visited but a store where you looked at a catalog on your couch and had it ends mailed to you and it was health in many ways by the U.S PS the postal service\nHad rural free delivery and that meant that male routes could extend all the way in the rural areas and so Sears could reach people where they were\nAnd then eventually what happened is as you saw people streaming from rural parts of the country to urban parts of the country they said\nWell we have to follow them and it followed them with stores so in many ways just as Amazon is essentially a huge leveraged bet on the future of commerce going virtual Sears was also a leverage better very successful average bet on the future of shopping being\nOr they're just in the twenty seconds we have left here what's the big lesson for Amazon from what happened to Sears\nWell the first lesson is that retailers always in the state of metamorphosis and large technological changes that helps Sears at the early twentieth century hurt Sears no late twentieth century and the second is that ... years grew by adding business after business\nAnd it's important to remember whether you're Amazon or any entrepreneur listening right now adding more businesses is not the same as building a better business you have to focus on your core customer above all\nTheir Thompson senior editor at the Atlantic thanks as always thank you you're listening to hear now [noise]\n\nSupport for WABC comes from Agnes Scott college presenting distinguished writer in residence Melissa Fay Greene discussing her book the temple bombing on the bombings sixtieth anniversary Wednesday at six in Campbell hall complimentary admission\nExactly where you are right now um but you know where we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong it exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good [noise] and so many other domains [noise]\nIs it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain are there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\n[noise] this is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the strict goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humidity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um well it reminds\nMe of Y. two K. right that we all thought the world is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts all forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is

you're catering to your creditors demands and also more importantly while you are really trying to face this massive competition\n[noise] we think of so many things when we think of Sears those catalogs are I guess there were also pre cut kit houses which in North Carolina still make up the majority of some towns what Sears going to be remembered for at least the Sears that we know now maybe there will be a series of the future that is known for something else\nYou know I I actually think not only the catalog but all those different ancillary brands and whether it's a lands and being one of them you know some of these brands really meant a lot to people on and think about this year's was the everything's door before Amazon or even the Internet existed\nAnd in it's heyday check this

O. two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing in all of these uh schemes to remove CEO to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one\nWith planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else as growing food\nUm that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future and if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food\nAnd using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects of things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nAnd then also we know that dead trees only\nArchiving for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there is a permanent issue with a story in the ... too in um injuries that um is not such an issue of your stories underground for example\nSo let's move on to some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what if some of the ideas there\nSo the idea of carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions there's a way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy it takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops in the power plant and instead of putting that Syria to back into the atmosphere you're gonna do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground were tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use to store ... and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nA crate and food security issues which is something we want to avoid what about\n... and by the way I just said Steven Pinker is a chicken to knock at his new book a nightmare now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of it's just going to be on a technologies that we are you know we don't even have yet that was I going to come along but what about just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or spacecraft where you need to remove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the idea is could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to that's in the air capture that's due to compress it and then store underground that is appealing one of the most appealing aspect of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nThat almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive so something like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "15"}
