how to use the body's immune system to attack cancer Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform\nAt the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis on main insight was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that every day people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably at Dr level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone [noise]\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree man and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes and you know therapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including patients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that Jim steam has developed we can see the ...\nPercent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond these are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nUh genes Allison started his career at Andy Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the MBA Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... is the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again

recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty seven teams and Steve was the number is up thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why [noise]\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week here in Kansas\nBe about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and\nLike I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have lifted in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lotta times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Atlanta",
