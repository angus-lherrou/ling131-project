we reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies with poised to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nBut Russia and turkey struck a fragile deal to wait to establish a demilitarized zone around it live and give rebel and radical groups deadlines to leave so what happened BBC Middle East editor Jeremy ... is in London but just back from a reporting trip and it live on the regime side front line soldiers and Fox holes pretty remarkable\nJeremy at some of those deadlines for leading are right about now so what did you see are the rebels militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelve now and the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth\nThey're meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new DMZ though they've\nBeen put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in saying it's going well [noise] uh up to now they appear to be moving\nAnd then what happened is that if it if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leaning that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a sport you Michael die Haji hobbies I think that this what the DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWell meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including a troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nOr with the troops that didn't want to be seeing were Russians somewhere okay we're talking but there were a tool good about being filmed all recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the\nTerms of the physical state of the area you drive along and there is one wrecked religious after another wrecked religion mostly those places a ghost towns now\nLet's listen to a little of the sound that you got to do because in these destroyed towns around the region a you found Abu Mohammed who'd been able to reopen his barber shop astonishingly associated with me\nI said we always hope for a few ... of the structure of the whole region the employees or pause for these last six of them that\nSay some of the costs him but from your reporting it seemed like you wander around wondering where did these people go they'd either become refugees in these and mostly empty towns or\nAnd killed while I wondered every time I saw yet another and to tell us what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from a liberal and I think some will be dead and others will be inside of the city itself\nUp ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a show old or did a deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up they offer them a way out whether they would be bust up to his lip\nAnd that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive around that area as we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThat the war's too in the hot out of the country it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus and you go to places like the area rounded lipped than you can really see walked the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSo what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian die hard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that have you know taken advantage of the situation there he had the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back occurred and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of the sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interests a Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nAnd do you speak first\n[noise] [noise] like hell\nWe will be okay [noise]\nThey'll never followed how do you [noise]\nWould you make a joke like that you didn't after after I'm not going to where we got to otherwise we're dead [noise] go back downstream where they got [noise]\nGet away from me I Want to\nMaybe one or do you [noise]\nI don't\nAnd you know I said what would you [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou're crazy [noise] probably\nHave reassuring [laughter] [laughter] so that's my guest Robert Redford with a Paul Newman from the Nineteen sixty nine from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were you surprised at how famous that scene became\n[noise] yes I was I mean that I was surprised that the whole thing I remember when I when I saw the rough cut I mean I Love making the film a lot of fun I've never had so much fun on a film is what I have that one but when when I saw the the roof covered\nI said wait a minute what that song doing in it\nOh raindrops are falling on my head but you have to wait a minute what's\nThat all about what in the house and they I should raindrops first of all it's not raining\nSecondly what's that going to do with anything I I thought well that that they're just killed a film [laughter]\nIt it made no sense to me and you know how wrong can you be in and listen to that song in radio for six months [laughter] but the film also a Terry or no thing is interesting about how uh I guess the value word of mouth um I remember when the film came out\nA ... year old William Goldman very upset and depressed because the reviews were mixed to negative and um [noise] a word of mouth is what made the film build but when it first opened it had these mixed reviews I didn't read them\nI remember there were very upsetting to produce and one of the reasons the reviews some of the reviews were negative was that the anachronism of the dialogue like modern day talk then I found that pretty inspiring in fun it was just fun\nBut apparently that that's what some of the negative response was but it was just over written by the by the acceptance of the whole film by\nThe way I had the same reaction about rain wrapped in front of my head in the middle of the film I thought\n[laughter] that sounds to me [laughter] that was you and me then there's there's two of us [laughter]\n[noise] well I unfortunately our time is up that's really been a pleasure to talk with you thank you so much for coming back to your jury and ... and more pleasant than mine [laughter] ...

Washington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nShot you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nThat'd be a source close to touch investigation of said turkey has gotten documents that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored mud ... she went into the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago [noise]\nUm this also tells us that I'm On course official position is still that stick a show gee is missing about that a section ... knows for sure that he was mud I'm not a backstop the American news reports and all that audio an avid an audio and video a video evidence\nThe recordings shoving that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that\nAnd they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten I'm On some reports that his body was dismembered um the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slap denying all the allegation how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media um there's just not strange communication strategy with this government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't actually have a ... kind of communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moving pictures that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining study more cautious approach except for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here\nTo be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation or the Saudis have proposed that is the tax plan\nAnd saying we're going to we don't want to do on diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that forced tightening the screws on the Saudis and try and get the ... western backing for the position that question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation\nHas to be how credible it can be\nIf it includes the Saudi Government yeah and I I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a a diplomatic nice city on the causes of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their explosive allegations and there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case\nThat a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been no ... particularly by tequila ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalist and the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged doping trees deny that it's not even know murdering hey we're talking about uh how ... locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them in completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there in his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the rejection of Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage\nBought a I think that you know clearly tucked he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its\nSovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S and from the western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson\nHeld in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government\nUh what are we learning about that [noise]\nYeah this is a country that produces more news than it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on
