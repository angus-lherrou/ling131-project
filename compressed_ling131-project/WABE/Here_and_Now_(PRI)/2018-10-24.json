joins us from W ELL are in in Miami Jaime gay Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state [laughter] and we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been sending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation that a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told him about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum response awesome\nBut he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are\nBeing that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third I'm democratic I'm a I'm an African\nAmerican Candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a disastrous on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the President's Day people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation our water resources which has been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on in teaching Donald Trump\nI don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bumps so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying or\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the St Louis was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for Kennedy\nWell and make it as if they don't let

criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not
