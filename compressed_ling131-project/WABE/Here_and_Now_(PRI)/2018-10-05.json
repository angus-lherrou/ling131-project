lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine that was during the Vietnam War when many potential workers were out of the workforce fighting in Southeast Asia\nToday's labor market is tied for other reasons\nA very strong economy has boosted demand for workers and the retirement of the baby boom is slowing growth in the workforce\nEmployers added only a hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs

confirmed how energized do you think Democrats will be in the terms how energized Republicans be\nThe key thing for me to remember and remind people that was the Democrats were already energized you can't lose suburban moms twice that's the Republican argument that says this is going to be a net positive for them\nRepublicans have been reminded of why they're Republicans at all this has been a moment to unify the anti uh the never Trump or is an demographer folks everyone seems to be together on the case of Brett Kavanaugh Lisa Murkowski vote not withstanding so I Do think Republicans are looking this is a net positive I'd also say\nThere were four weeks ago we spent the last three of them talking about\nA a judge Kavanaugh if the next four are consumed by other things they wild wacky

Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen\nAnd joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon hosting senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\n[noise] hey how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid representing the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call him senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the land to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no\nIt took me a few seconds to place his best so per that I thought of course it's Sam Eliot then Eliot showed up as Jackson's much older brother and long suffering caretaker and it's a trip hearing them growl at each other in the same voice\nThe most shocking scene in all versions of a star is born takes place at an award ceremony the Oscars or Grammys in this case the Grammys this one tops them all in the humiliation department it's excruciating\nTowards the end of the movie I heard sniffles and knows is being blown all over the theater man this material is shameless and man does it work whatever its lapses a star is born will be a monster hit audiences will love Cooper for his tender suffering on screen\nAnd for showing us the soul that was always there beneath Lady Gaga is outrageous costumes they'll want to seek ... at the Oscars as much as fans in the movie wanna see alley at the Grammys\nDavid Edelstein his film critic for New York magazine\nOn Monday show when Leonard Cohen died in twenty sixteen he left behind many

I'm Jeremy hops and\nI'd rather than young it's here and now another ten day this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nWas voted to to a final floor vote tomorrow that could happen as soon as tomorrow morning but senators can change their vote tomorrow syndrome has been will be a key swing Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes as he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow and the something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today to she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you Nina what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said when I was expecting before I miss this one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no with Lisa Murkowski then everything\nIs on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say a ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation um mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other now the question is Scott Detrow what do you think's going to happen\nBut I think there are a couple indications that that that count is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short\nAnd the fact that she just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged with a lunch they felt very confident about how the boats going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nLike you know when one of the leading meaner Scott just remind us which the math here tomorrow I mean what what how you know what happens if there's a tie ... changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to ... ... what do\nWe look you've got your guy on ...\nOn the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans up at fifty one seats Democrats or forty nine seats uh today's a cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hop to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty than vice president Mike Pence comes and break the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation vote\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making\nIt does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this is ... whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely Joe mansion\nIt's more than anyone else Joe mansion is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe's somebody who supported uh Trump last nominee meal Gore's such and ah before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Cavanaugh mansions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is\nBecause if you if you vote for capital if he helps get cabin on the on the court ... the loan Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you know then uh then he might lose a lot of support and they were again president ... popular\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office\nRight now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and ... you will know they've been people in the corners of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but huge crowd there now\nAnd then you know just your thought because ... everybody the same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a tie what what's your thinking about having a\nCabinet heading towards the Supreme Court potentially it sounds like you know most likely\n... vote that ... ... the time yeah I'm sure that he and Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget\nThat it was a tie vote that uh that the vice president broke the tie on\nAnd I I don't actually think that that it may be significant and some historical sense\nBut given the number of rules that have been changed or broken in the last two years to get through first Neal ... such when I'm ... Republican leader McConnell uh led the fight and it was much of a fight because they had the votes to get rid of the filibuster rule so that\nYou could confirm somebody with ... simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the\nProtections for people with pre existing conditions should want to adjust his who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother researcher ... that I heard often is that judge ... cannot be trusted if like case involving alleged wrong doing by the president were to come before the court\n... basis for this argument seems to be two fold first judge cabinet has written that he believes that ... shouldn't act legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while ... end up\n... I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue that fact said judge cabinet awkward Vince legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nProtection currently second there are some who\nArgued that given the current special counsel investigation President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust of\nThat argument ignores our recent history\nPresident Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was come first served Ninety six to three\nThat next year just three months after independent counsel Robert Fisk was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar\nHe was confirmed ... eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them\nPerhaps most notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys who heard the case joins the ... opinion against him\nJudge cabinet I head spin unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law he\nHas stated that ... versus Madison Youngstown steel versus Sawyer and the United states versus Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and the history why do they have in common is each of them\nIs a case where Congress served as the chat on presidential power and I would note that the fourth case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as some the greatest in history was brown versus the board of education [noise]\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about the check on presidents empowered directly [noise] he wrote the opinion in harmed on birds in the United states a case that challenges the Bush administration ... military commission\nProsecution of an associated with some of bin Laden\nThis conviction what's very important to the Bush administration\nBut judge Kavanaugh who had been appointed to the DC circuit by President Bush and hadn't worked in President Bush's White House rule that the conviction was sons last fall\nAs he explained during the hearing quote\nWe do make decisions based on who people are\nOr their policy preferences or at the moment we face decisions on the law\nAnd the\nSide's Mets with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement threat is the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribed the ... decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark precedent he also cited Justice Kennedy's ... masterpiece cage cakes shop opinion\nFor the court's majority stating that quote the day of trading gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words\nAre over in the Supreme Court and quote\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds the extreme views some birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh incurred the does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure\nThe availability of contraceptive services for women while I'm In um\nSeeing the involvement of employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently over and looked at this point judge Kavanaugh has been sent\nRejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling\nInterest and facilitating access to contraception in fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in facilitating access to birth control\nThere is also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v Wade protecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three\nOf our constitution itself he believes set precedent it's not just a judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay the two roles of precedents\nIn other words precedent Jason ... goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that presidents provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot rightly overturn a precedent\nThe most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education over\nRules ... versus for ... cents correcting a gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term allowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believe that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the constitution\nWould follow longest established precedent except those rare circumstances where a decision is gravy asleep wrong or deeply in ... with the law does\nOur judge Kavanaugh's praised the\nAs the judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be trimmed narrowed discarded or over and looked\nIts roots in the constitution gives the concept of starry just sites is greater way such that the president can't be trimmed or narrowed\nSimply because the judge might want to on a whim\nEnsured his views on honoring precedents would priests clued attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do over [noise]\nNoting that roe v Wade was decided forty years forty five years ago and reaffirmed Nineteen years later and Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nI asked judge Kavanaugh or whether the passage of time is relevant to following president he said decision to become part of our legal framework with the passage of time\nAnd that on a ring precedent it's essential to maintaining public confidence\nOur discussion then turn to the right of privacy on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold versus Connecticut a case that struck down the law banning the use and sale of contraception\nGriswold tablets the legal foundations that led to row eight years later\nIn just griping Britain's falls as settles law judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application up two famous cases from the Nineteen twenties\nJudge cabinet forest fully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury mark judge denied under penalty of felony that she had witnessed an assault PJ Smith\nAnother person they'll allegedly ate at the ... denied said he was fair under penalty of felony\nPer faster sports life long friends ... Kaiser indicated that under penalty of felony she does not remembered that party and ms Kaiser went further\nShe indicated that not only does she not remember and I like that but also that she just not even know Brett Kavanaugh\nIn addition to Alaska corroborating evidence we also learned some facts have raised more questions for instance since these allegations have become public professor Ford\nTestify that not a single person has contacted her to say I was that the party that night [noise]\nFurthermore the PR faster testified that all those she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance she would have needed or bright\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones who drove her home or wherever in the car with her than nine\nAnd professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people look at ... am without saying goodbye and to strive none of them called or the next day or\nTo ask why she left is she okay not the federal click and Susan Collins of Maine speaking live on the center for Kaiser [noise]\nMr President the constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims Italy's that his says showing up to each senator\nThis is not a criminal trial and I do not believe that the claims such as these need to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt [noise] never those last fairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold\n[noise] of more likely than not as SARS standard the facts presented do not mean\nThat President that professor for what's not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time\nBut they do lead me chick ... clues that the allegations fails to me the more likely than not standard\nThere for I Do not believe that these charges Ken fairly per bad judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court [noise]\nLet me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that I Want to sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country\nTo the contrary if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process\nIt has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the PR face of ... of this terrible problem\nI have been on my arms and disturbed however by some who have suggested that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's rejected the Senate is somehow can Joan and sexual assault\nNothing could be further from the true every person man or woman\nWho make such hardships sexual assault just serves to be heard and treated with respect me too movement is real it matters is\nNeeded and did it's long overdue\nWe know that rape and sexual assault or less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault on average an estimated two hundred eleven thousand suns rape and sexual assaults go unreported every year\nWe ... to survivors and every day we must see to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many we all this to our cells our children and generations to come\nSince the hearing\nI have listened to many survivors of sexual assault many were total strangers who told me their heart wrenching stories for the first time in their lives [noise] some of our friends\nThat I had known for decades yeah with the exception of one woman who has confided to me years ago\nI had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attacks\nI Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward and I hope that in heightening public awareness they have also lighten\nThe burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years\nTo them I pledge to do all that I can to ensure\nThat their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences\nThe past few weeks I've been in ... that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and the value way the serious allegations of sexual assault\nI called for and support is the additional hearing to hear from both professor force and judge Kavanaugh\nI also push for\nForwarded the FBI supplemental background investigation this was the right thing to do Christine for never saw the spotlight\nShe indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee and she is Sean attention since then\nShe seemed completely unaware of chairman grass leaves off or to allow her to testify confidentially in California\nWatching her Mr President I could not help but feel that some\nPeople who wanted to engineer said to speed up this nomination cared a little less if at all\nWealthy professor Ford testify that a very limited number of people had access to her the latter\nYet that letter found its way into the public domain she testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be related\nAnd yet here we are we are in the middle of a fight that she never Bob saw\nArguing about claims said she wanted to raise confidentially\nNow one theory I heard his spouse repeatedly is that our colleagues Senator Feinstein lead professor Ford's bladder at the eleventh hour to do ... press and I wanted state says very clearly\nI Know Senator Dianne Feinstein extremely well and I believe that she would never do that\nI knew that should be the case before she even stated it at the here and she is a person of integrity and I stand by her [noise]\nI also heard some argue that the chairman of the committee somehow treated professor Ford unfairly nothing could be further from the truth\nChairman Grassley along with his excellent staff treated professor forward with compassion and respect throughout the entire process and that is the way the senator from Iowa has conducted himself\nThroughout a lifetime dedicated to public service",
