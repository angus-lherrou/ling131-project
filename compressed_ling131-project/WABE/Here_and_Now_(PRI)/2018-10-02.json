people for quote groundbreaking invent inventions in the field of laser physics\nHalf of the prize goes to Ninety six year old American Arthur Ashe Ken who invented the optical tweezers a laser that allows physical material to be moved using light\nThe other half of the prize is being awarded jointly to Canadian Donna strict land and France's her are more role\nFor church pulse amplification

I think the Nobel Committee is increasingly sensitive as is the entire scientific community about looking very very broadly about who actually contributed\nTo inventions or scientific discoveries when they award these prizes and I think that's a terrific thing and this year I think they got it right\nLast year the Nobel Prize in physics went to three scientists or who helped recognize the detection of gravitational waves are in space this year as you said it's for work using light what does it tell you about the research that's going on physics today\nWell interestingly of course the tool that we use to measure the gravitational waves\nUses lasers as the sensitive element to detect the gravity way so there's some commonality and the two years um one way of looking at it is that the discovery last year was for real scientific discovery whereas the prize this year looks at an invention\nBut I think the important point here is that this invention that's being rewarded this year is actually being used for basic science\nAll over the world uh and so this interplay between invention of a tool and the use of it for science you can really uh find the boundary between those who ideas

Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes ... is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which ah his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which\nAh that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which an incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something that a cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from\nAnd I was ... have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that\nRefers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same but the same thing as your book page back to you have the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence a sixteen year what page\nOn 'em game ... till about that's not what proved means\nWell it's sort of unclear what booth means in that context right I mean I\nI I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kevin uh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is\nDevil's triangle drinking game has that played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know okay so ...\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engineer triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\nHot and should be\nWhy did I\nThen\n\n\nFresh air is executive producer is guinea mellor\nOur interviews and review used it produced an edited by any salad and that's ...

year and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers walking back to your know\nGlad to be with your Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it [noise]\nNever seen so much to do\nAbout so little\nI thought the old trade regime between Canada and Mexico in the United states was a good one and this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major\nAlienation of major allies I Can't imagine\nThese are ... relatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing as it was this has been a major diversion\nFrom the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement\nPrincipally because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are\nTiny compared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia\nHas been constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies\nFor the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used to go after them have been quite problematic\nThey emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese on a road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage an influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which is surely the most effective way\nTo influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nKinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete\nThat's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on\nCutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on big tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nAnd she said anything since the testimony last Thursday from Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nNot much I mean the only thing that she's said is that she is supportive of the um this FBI probe that is going to dig a little bit deeper into those allegations she has said that\nBut other than that she's really keeping a low profile you know I think probably just waiting for the outcome of that FBI a inquiry to decide how she's going to vote\nNo Maine is a state that is represented in the governor's office by pretty conservative Republican poll the page how much pressure discounts face from conservatives that's a good question\nI mean right now what you're seeing is overwhelming pressure from a progressive groups but lying in wait I suspect if she were to vote against Kavanaugh or even signaled that she would oppose his nomination would be certainly a backlash from conservatives and\nYou know certainly governor Apollo page has exerted some of that pressure on Collins personally in the past he did it during some key healthcare votes last year and I would imagine that he would do the same if um she had given any kind of indication that she would oppose Kavanaugh's nomination she hasn't done that yet she's\nShe's struck me as somebody who's been wanting to get to yes on Kavanaugh over the last\nMonth or so but that made you know if something happens if something comes up during the FBI probe that raises questions for her and she somehow signals that she would oppose him I Would expect that she would see it as much pressure on the on the right and she's been seeing on the left Steve ... chief\nPolitical correspondent for Maine Public Radio's Steve thank you my pleasure and you're listening to hear an [noise]\n\nTiny point one W eighty Atlanta I'm Jim

happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\n\nIt's here and now and we've spoken here over the years about early retirement a couple of who sold their home traveling and staying in other people's homes to save money\nMillennials who worked damn night to earn a million dollars and live off investment income well there's now a name for this it's called fire financial independence retire early and fire is on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let Scott ... he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nI ... for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete Adnani what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that podcast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalk about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nExactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nAnd our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste you know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves up moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession\nI was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know beyond the financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at her retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this is the sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you'd gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about a ring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just say you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around that what you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest brief to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get
