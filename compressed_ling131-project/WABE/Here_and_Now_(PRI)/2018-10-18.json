see\nMe jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside and looking up will help us to understand\nMaybe a little bit more about each other and it's still just a tiny bit more connected around this planet so you know some people will look up the sky and they will feel love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive\nAnd how they express that is what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up\nWe're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah guy period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in the city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut well I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and being more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people think we're always talking about stars right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night\nIn each time there's this then shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warns us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're\nCome face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts\nLike you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there

Democrats who were\nUm rallying against the justice so he is trying again to show that he is among or that he's willing to listen to both sites and then make a decision on behalf of Tennessee and

power could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic\nRodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana where there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney at you or an hour north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we took a shooting at a cat so we look at for which is somewhat\nUsual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people will realize that they stole it does affect people that deep inland and when you've got a storm of this magnitude and movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged has pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part I'm a roof off and we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYeah well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us that's on now in what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bad and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser currently the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that cheese guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using tax rules an aerial pictures that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nNow with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd an actor big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome as difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nOh what what are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much debris though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature in twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level a emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it's so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the\nYears you don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast right in town down and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that and this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee that this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best case I get very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is

there anything Democrats can do to stop Republicans from doing this\n[noise] [noise] yeah they can win elections Republicans control the White House and Donald Trump has been nominating these young conservatives for the federal bench and Republicans control the Senate which has the advice and consent function here so if Democrats really want to do something\nThey're going to need to win more elections now if you talk to\nA progressive advocates and activists out there and they say that Democrats could have been firmer and standing up last week and not agreeing to this deal to confirm Fifteen federal judges before they left town for the recess or there are some things on the margins that Democrats could do more of\nBut by and large the Republicans hold the power here and they're using it\nAnd just give us a sense of what we missed yesterday who got through\nYes so then the main focus of yesterday's hearing was a young woman lawyer named Allison rushing she's been nominated to
