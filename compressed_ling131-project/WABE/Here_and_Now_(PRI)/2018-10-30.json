G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah like the wind is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed [noise]\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminal\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out for the first it's my turn ... or they get outraged by measuring the get out it's my ... my ... and here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we had the highest increase in November of last year and he stayed in the nation All right so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about it is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind\nThat the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and we've got eight million voters we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers are up over where they weren't the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nPaid regularly points to public opinion polls supporting voter id and the state now paid sat with an ad where he's holding a football and dressed in black and white striped referee outfit\nAs Iowa secretary of state it's my job to be the referee not to wear team Jersey [noise] we're going to make sure your vote counts easy to vote in ...
