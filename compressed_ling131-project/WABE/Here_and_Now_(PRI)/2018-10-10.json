kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and uh just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and I was required to resign um

... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers who've had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that's takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have for every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my

assumption is if you're first to kind of build this ten lane superhighway in the sky that you know if you build it they're going to come right that these companies and these innovators are going to come to your country\nYeah what are people saying about the challenges of rolling out this infrastructure\nOne of the great big challenges that comes over and over with five gee it's how expensive it is to build the network on one reason is because of the nature of the frequency where these signals are going to be transmitted is the cells are going to have to be really close together so every little physical piece of infrastructure is going to have to be much closer together\nThan it is now they don't have to be this big giant cell phone towers the nature of the technology is you know could be a small little pizza box sized thing on top of a light pole but all those have to be installed you have to negotiate with the city or the owner of a house\nTo be able to put it there so one of the price tax that one of the consulting firm said was you know\nThe order of three hundred billion dollars in the U.S to build us out\nSo what is the timeline for the rollout compared to some of those other places\n[noise] so the first five phones there's talk that they'll be coming out in the next year\nIn two or three years there's talk that some of the networks will be commercial ready to move into this Internet of things these machines that talked to one another will be out in the market\nYou know it's a broader timeline well you know a lot of folks in the industry talk about a five year roll out and even more broadly that each of the past generations of wireless technology three ... each of those generations has been about a decade so maybe that kind of order of magnitude\nScott tongue in the marketplace reporter and our former China correspondent tomorrow and the show we'll talk about the tension between companies who wants to roll out five gee infrastructure and the cities

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor K. PCC Hi Mary hey there so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people are Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance well\nIt's tough the math is tough for him of the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when he has to have a lot of appeal to independent voters and some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming and zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are couple areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood on during the ...\nAnd the funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored and our governor Jerry Brown using has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as loud as\nWell as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think that what it's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know I have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nPeople to move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meaning if you don't have this kind of wrong the drugs are boring grew in California can do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that does independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nBut then each one becomes a
