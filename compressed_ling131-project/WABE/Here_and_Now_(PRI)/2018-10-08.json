brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their release of being detained for what is it ... well I'm ... well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charging them with and and in the end it was something\nAkin to disturbing the social order\nUm but the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handouts stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminists are quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse\nAnd and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men in China only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there will be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what\nHappened to that [noise] yes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms on\nThat but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially and so many ways and that's\nDifferent activities to banks can do to make the credit in Egypt communities and it includes giving grants and giving a loans to programs that support low to moderate income populations and so there's some things that we can do there to help\nEducate banks about how they can invest in programs that provide some job skills training 'em and can invest in broadband appointment\nBut it's somewhat limited by the the writing the legislation\nYeah do you feel like the over all sort of regulatory framework that we're in right now is helping or hurting could there be more help from the federal government also\nSo my opinion um [laughter] you opinions of the Federal Reserve\nThere is a significant discrepancy in what's available from one to me the next and our federal dollars going into it and we're seeing more states set up rural broadband commissions and putting some funding into it but we also know that the regulations may not always be up to part and making that easy to do and so\nUh when I was out in Cheyenne, Wyoming you know I was talking to some folks out there that said they have such a high percentage of land it's owned by the federal government\nAnd to run into it and run lines across federal lands requires a whole other set of\nRegulations and so if you think about how we deployed electricity a hundred years ago you know we recognize that it wasn't profitable for for profit companies to run the lines out twenty miles out one farmer and so that's where I got to roll co ops and I do think that it's a sticking point right now and trying to figure out how we\nGet are regulations to be in line with deploying broadband Raleigh instill supporting are for profit concept with the Internet service providers\nOn that government intervention question a poll last month by the advocacy group connect Americans now found that Seventy two percent of respondents

in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston\nThe hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court has some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student beat John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues since right right and he I mean you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was the best chance face right All right yeah so ... yeah and uh has sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who was sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid\nAnd so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and that sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab\nAnd which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking\nNot invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and ... where he says I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of\nA little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does ... in the book realized that understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that have sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting and I think that's important too especially for boys where\nThey might say like you know step or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in our life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more

to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the

from the current stalemate all the extremists of al ... and I says\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down and look what does that mean it means that\nThe humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people are on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals are isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at\nGas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment as being ravaged by war that is not to the benefit of any of the sides are waging it was in fact being exploited\nBy extremists and I think that the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S and the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSo hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U.S and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand I'm fourteen or two and a third Lynn importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh\nThe uh costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo says the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nThat obviously sticks in the ... because I met a young ... who ... told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nA lot more bellicose language uh whereas back then Brock Obama called U.S China strategy appeal but at the core though isn't the goal continuing to try to stop China's rise I I\nKnow if it's to stop the rise I Do think that both administrations share one core belief and that is that\nYou know they want China to actually continue modernizing its economy\nBut they are not so clear that they like these business in trade practices which essentially said to the United states and the company's based in the United states come on cell you're good cheer you can operate but you're gonna have to cough up your technology or go into a joint venture with the Chinese company\nSo I don't think that we're trying to stop China I think we're trying to make the Chinese trade practices fairer and I think that has\nBeen consistent over the last dozen or so years and how effective is\nWell you know right now we don't know and and I think that these trade tariffs have become really problematic\nOn in in essence because they start sparking other conversations we we hear Chinese officials saying hey you know you want to be really tough you want to start putting more terrorists another two hundred and fifty seven billion dollars of goods well don't forget we're the key to North Korea\nSo this isn't just a trade issue it's a power issue and it does appear that the Trump Administration is trying to throw a wedge and they're getting allies on one side all lined up with new trade policies and then forcing the allies to kind of come with a U.S and freeze out China\nAnd try to really agitated for more reform we don't know whether it's going to be successful or not but it does seem to be a bit more strategic than initially thought\nJoe ... singer business

gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better
