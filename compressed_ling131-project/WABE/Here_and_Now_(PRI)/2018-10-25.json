Waltzer rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this was driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have\nThat way to to begin rebuilding their homes will and\nRebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have to really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some terminated called one that gives them the ability of last\nAnd so I've got like ... it's just a measure we call him Jae su loss is allowed\nAfter two days here\nOur through to smile immigration just describe what just friday has a job that he can recover and a lot of shows you that\nThere's more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by if they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for\nA fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and say they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah but running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ...
