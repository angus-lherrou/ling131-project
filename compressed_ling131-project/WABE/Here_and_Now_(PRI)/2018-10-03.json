trade agreement how does it change how data moves across borders and and what are some of the provisions that it makes\nSo I'll give you a couple of examples one of the things that it says is that as a default rule data can move back and forth across borders there some circumstances under which you can't but generally speaking that's the default rural and what that means in concrete terms\nIs that if you are providing cloud computing you don't have to build a data center at every country in the world in order to provide cloud computing\nIt also means that countries can't force data to stay within their borders in order for companies to be able to do business there\nAnd that's really important when you're talking about emerging technologies light cloud computing or data analytics or artificial intelligence because they don't work and less data can move across borders fairly easily\nThat's obviously important the software companies but it's really important for the customers a software company so for every small medium or large does does that wants to use cloud computing or wants to use a higher wants to use data analytics\nThey should care about this what\nComes next I mean I assume that this conversation around digital trade from both the legal and economic perspective is just going to get bigger right\nRight it's really it's only beginning I think one thing that we can forget sometimes that these technologies cloud computing artificial intelligence are still really new and that's part of the reason that there aren't international rules around them\nThey're only going to increase in terms of their importance to our economy and so the conversations around them are only going to increase and expand but right now we don't have a good consensus around these rules it's really not sustainable Victoria Aspen\nAl is CEO of the trade group the software alliance the other burning question about the new agreement U.

cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a a simple cell as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry in a beaker a flask\nWe control of fewer of uh the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we all Timothy observe\nBut in a in a living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker and ... the real breakthroughs here are to be able to\nFine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary processes is is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications of this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in so imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex chemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems we couldn't imagine making in the chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enable us to uh\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process are created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the ... or ... generates a as\nAn all or alcohol

her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou you're away from home so perhaps some projects protected from the image it on the slopes this can happen today\nI think I Can't reach my show for it [laughter] [laughter]\nOr as a Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna stripped Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work what\nAll of that meeting for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] will also point out that from what I can tell this is the first

if the board decided to settle so some last minute change of heart some drama\nDo you think that toss a Tesla Elon Musk are ready to put that behind them I mean do you think it'll do much long term damage\nI think they were extremely ready to go to ... and we saw how much of an overhang hadn't stuck by the fact that it went up Seventeen percent on Monday or though they said it has come back down again\nThat's not the only other behind they have there's still a department of justice investigation that that is hanging over then that could potentially lead to criminal charges although some experts I spoke to said\nThat the settlement with the SEC potentially makes that less likely I think the onus bitter is not really on the board there being questioned throughout all of this about

that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cast treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong decried if that memory a lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lassie forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked forward they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline report it is the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the seas rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nBeen very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual fault I'm so the symptoms and stress reactions at the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if they are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and\nIt's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this you heard of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and our nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this is it about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help but when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically one of three ways we are going to fight\nWe're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and what lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative they are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "03"}
