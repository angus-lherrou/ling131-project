signing with Sheila pre bright performances by dad's garage and drop in art making activities tickets at high dot org\nWas first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way Frieden and some legal experts see it this time is different [noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level but\nThis year every appointment was made by Republicans a Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Emory game as was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that\nBut for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you in all the different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami

who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip petition signed by registered voters and\nI completely agree with you but let's just break this down\nJust looking back in the grand sweep of human history there was always being contested values bought humans have struggled full for\nThousands of years it's some degree of oversight or at the very least some degree of transparency about the decision making abilities that affect our lives and in the past they may be kings of Congress and today parliaments and in the future there'll be increasingly those who write the code that shapes all day to day lives\nI look forward to a time where we can debate in good faith\nThe political implications of Google's algorithm twist is I'll go to them but the truth is most of his kept secret just now and if you can get to the laughter while the one that I just described I think it would be an improvement on today's because at the very least then we can try to agree that the ... shouldn't just be the enrichment of attacks but Robin the common good as a whole\nIt feels like when you look at all of this the distorting foresee or it's going to be capitalism right like the the reason not to make the algorithms transparent is gonna be competition and that seems to be hard for us to overcome\nAnd that's a key argument in my book what we have is systems that are being generated developed and deployed pursuant to the logic of capitalism which is fine but actually the consequences are kind of political\nAnd the logic of politics would say at you they should be more used for the common good they should be regulated in the scene where is the logic of capitalism says they should be used to compete and they should be used to enrich\nJamie ... author of the new book future politics living together in a world transformed by tack on that enrichment note Google recently canceled a contract\nTo develop a I with the department

following a story involving special counsel Robert Mueller and it's not about the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him and be our national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird those what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR from someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller\nAnd what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these women because I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that need it was too that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here has special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and jak Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call\nThe crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations are are legit accusations this week involving\nPutative misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nA intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things in it a true and which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors in models not real human beings\nWell now my head is officially exploded and we have a lot less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities\nAnd behind paying these women just say something about Muller I mean ... ... what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of it as clear however we do know the special counsel's office as us as that's the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn an adult in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was to receive money an exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell meanwhile earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected

and analysis for the day I had\nNational international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are nine denies because one state the brass ... does not have both the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWill will with a straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers legislatures this was the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\nWell they run on issues like ah lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also running issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policies and coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans I really put there\nFor him a tour on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty cents us is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled and less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved and redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\n... from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\n... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles\nThe party in the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
