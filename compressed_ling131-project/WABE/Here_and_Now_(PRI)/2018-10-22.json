presidency and so we spend a lot of my time a lot on my classroom talking about the importance of state government and all of the things that governments can do and like all the powers of come to the tenth amendment\nAnd one of the things my students walk out of my classroom understanding each year is is that Congress actually has far more power than most Americans think they do and essentially everything that Donald Trump is doing right now if you like it then you should maintain a Republican Congress and if you're just like it you should try to overturn Congress\nI was thinking about um

that is coming up today is tremendously engaged in politics and cares about what's happening I think they're also very skeptical if not cynical about our national politics and\nWith their part one example you bring up I think that's actually demonstrative of what I was talking about earlier about state politics\nOr the national conversation about gun control policy is basically dead and it doesn't matter what happens there'll be a national movement there is room for movement of the state level and if you look at the Parkland shooting a those kids went to the floor to Capitol not the national capital and so refocusing some of the energy on the state politics I think there's a way to re engage students into politics\nThat Nathan bowling in high school government teacher at Lincoln

the narrative\nBut also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite rule they um with still processing one that happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened though we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBuddy clearly anytime we were alone with the girls the government mind as an security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is the full ... down and they were released well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his of they did give us the diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and then the phone what we do is\nThe uh the bills that you book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\n[noise] yes say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say see you know as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my maybe of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually\nWere kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ...

adapt to Trump at the fronds as the wind blows so that without having to have a lot of material structure\nThey can adapt to wins and therefore we see palm trees you know near hurricane a coastal

blades are angle so that as a spin around they're more in concert with the wind not fighting it as much\nThat reduces the strain on the blaze which means they can be built from letter material that means the blades can be much bigger to catch more energy\nAnd with aerospace technology whether it's spacecraft aircraft Irwin turbans mass translates the money so you really want to reduce your mass in order to reduce the cost of your project and therefore if we want to have a low cost of energy we really need to reduce overall mass restructure\nThe new offshore models will cost more to install

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\n... more or less what do we have fought for the kids they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they live for\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google race\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty second breast sorry to be nine sixty seconds breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and see which means that traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd then also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute blocker branded content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and ... and a and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the ... so they could be double or triple\nThe standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air is worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRight as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a John Carroll\nNow media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries they're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around\nIt allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers and he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSame your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars ... and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car and you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that all cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days

G and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nCell gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA but you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the the Republican convention so\nYou know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about him it keeps coming up in my conversations with people but so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know Cuban tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and\nThey're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate in New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican congressmen frankly beyond those retiring this\nYear after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party and just his popularity previously\nThat is

us some money and I conducted the interview as I always do and at the end of the interview they said oh uh um well we should tell you it wasn't because I said what was the inheritance and they said oh it wasn't inheritance I hit the lottery and then oh how much\nIn my jaundiced way and they said eighty million dollars and I almost fell off my chair anyway they conducted the interview that way they wanted to see what kind of human being I was how he treated other people before they hire\nA real quickly I Know a lot of people right now are getting their office pools together we do to hear now office boy one all of two dollars um so we're going to fight over those sixteen cents but the one of the rules I've heard is put put it down and writing\nYeah I mean absolutely you can put it down and writing and you know be careful who you go into a pool with and also obviously if you do when you do want to kind of keep it under wraps as long as you can because you don't want everybody to

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens I'm outta smartphone now and\nIt it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "22"}
