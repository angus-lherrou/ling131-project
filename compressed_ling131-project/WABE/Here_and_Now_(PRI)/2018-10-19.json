statistic\nBy twenty fifty to World Bank predicts that climate change could create as many as one hundred and forty three million climate migrants people moving to new places to escape conditions that are making it difficult to live\nTo put that into context that's double the number of refugees in the world today and well that migration would be unprecedented we have seen is smaller movements because of climate before many times within the United states it airs in Nathan Connelly our historians and host of the podcast back story will come back I\nHave you know I Know you're both us historians but I'm going to ask you to stretch the limits of your scholarship here are way way back to long before we were ever a country um what was the first human migrations that we saw because of climate in North America well\nArchaeologist tell us that you have at least in the twelve or Thirteen sensory Native Americans who are migrating because of massive droughts in the west and southwest in the Americas of course are being populated by people who are migrating from Asia so we have no sense of all the ways in which climate was driving them in the first place but even in those migrations and the twelve\nAnd Thirteen century you have a very clear reliance on crops like Mays I'm ways in which people are not able to rely on the consistency of the reins in decades long droughts in some cases\nAnd so these populations are being forced to move and to come into contact and so you have the Sunni and the hoping and the monkey on who are moving through and trying to find villages in some cases\nMoving along rivers and creating new moments of cultural contact but at great stress when you're talking about thousands of people who are forced to move and relocate oftentimes abandoning whole cities of civilization some of those places that we now see a tourist attractions in the southwest of these\nAnd empty villages in the hillside some of those are a product of these large massive migrations as another side point of this of course when the Europeans arrived many of them are migraines a very related sword I mean they're fleeing certain kinds of hardship\nIn Europe and many of them are talking about for instance to abundant timber in places like North America and trying to find ways in which they can get a slightly more regular life was given the deforestation that happened\nIn Europe and the Eighteenth nineteenth century and so there's going to be a constant relationship between mass migrations and concerns about the climate and sustainability\nAnd then once those Europeans got here and started establishing their own communities here oh what happened to me do we see similar things\nMoving forward what we need to think about the relationship between climate change is an issue about people as well you could argue that the to the worst things have happened in American history are directly related to that process which is the forced migration of a million people are across the American south\nUh because the climate there enabled this new crop of cotton that I'm ... tied back to Europe the way that Nathan was talking before this new industries that are driving\nAnd you found that and you were to slavery I mean I'm Sorry I just uh just to be specific to your yeah slavery I'm Talking about and you were seen that in many ways the word slavery uh\nSouthern Louisiana sugar cane fields which go up to the very boundary where the climate will allow them to go and and the rice fields on on the planet coast\nSo you see very finely attuned to just a few degrees temperatures you were talking about before about how you can have this forced migration of millions of people in slavery so I'm hearing a theme here\nThat people tend to follow where the plants and the crops will go because of course that's how we sustain ourselves but also our economies um what about other reasons that people moved historically related to the climate\nWell if you think about the large concern now around Atlantic storms there again there's a history of the ways in which hurricanes have forced all kinds of people to basically pull up stakes and relocate I mean this again has a kind of hemispheric\nImpact if you think for instance about some of the Atlantic storms that came through the Caribbean or even hit the southeast in the early part of the twentieth century many of these were quite cataclysmic with really substantial effects I mean you think about a storm in Nineteen Seventeen that really is racking the Caribbean and forcing people in the U.S descend remittances back in the Nineteen fifties\nYou have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps to spawn migration to England in that decade and even in the United states is a huge hurricane\nIn Nineteen forty seven late September\nThat creates a huge problem of displacement in the south east of the United states because largely the infrastructure isn't there and this is a reminder to listeners to think about on natural disasters right the hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans was about levees breaking for instance in in the south in the Nineteen forties\nYou at farmers who are being displaced folks were relocated because of racial segregation statues in the south had their whole homes relocated and then subsequently ripped up\nBy massive hurricanes you're talking about hundreds in some cases thousands of migrants of Atlantic storms because of discrimination and a lack of infrastructure even within the United states in the Nineteen\nForties you know we're talking about that even still today especially as these hurricanes come up the coast a lot of the conversation after\nMm because they were\nJust saying this to their mothers were saying about the\nThing the thing\nThat could be so hard to stay in any\nSinging it out [noise] and hoping that it can ... can be hard to hear [noise] matter what you do [noise]\nOne of the things I'm when I first discovered the

Eighteen into combat and she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican controlled district in the country in their favor\nYou know she prided herself on really tried to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district um but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts it's most evident last week she brought\nFor vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars at about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may be nationwide interest in this race I mean it's at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more\nTV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November six\nAnd what do the poll say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be\nPaul every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit ... there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge a and and really isn't something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nUh which is the flood control reservoir and so that's kind of containing and trying to release the flow of what was this historic are flooding events on the river\nNow the water level at lake Travis outside of Austin is it about seven hundred feet and if it keeps going up about I mean just about fourteen feet officials say the water will start to flow uncontrolled from that damn what's what's the danger there for the people downstream\nSo that's where it hits the spill way right and there is concern that if water starts going over the spillway that could endanger properties below it uh and part of the answer to that is that we do have added floodgates\nAlong the dam that holds in lake Travis and what are people that managed that river that lake are trying to decide is whether they're going to open additional floodgates that would\nIncrease the flow on the river that goes straight through Austin but it may decrease the lake level you know a to a more\nComfortable level last month was the wettest September on record and it's not over more rain is in the forecast and it was just looking this morning that looks like at this point through Wednesday how concerned are people about what's still to come\nI mean I think in a situation like this now we've had rain for I mean it's just been raining for a long time you're not always heavy storms but it\nIt just feels like kind of a constant drizzle which isn't always the case in Texas you know our ground is saturated are like I said our river system is for any more rain right now is is I'm concerned [noise]\nMost Michelle a reporter at K.

rough couple of weeks a three percent drop last Wednesday or one percent decline yesterday\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street's history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWe're talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday Israeli an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you that\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kinda wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why had we not\nRecognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to it\nGreat question and hide your race that Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble and the silver market but\nWhat was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces\nBarely knew each other's names so\nWe open on a world where\nAir official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that they are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately and the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention\nAnd then along the way I illustrate the heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of\nMisjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light and they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years\nAnd they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who were creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kind of familiar after having just lived through the crash of two thousand a you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system\nThe same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in high speed hurt investing strategies with fragmented oversight so we're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of
