we've also been seeing big policy proposals on prescription drugs on immigration as we said\nUh what do you make a hundred ... how the president is approaching big issues in these final days\nWell in fact the matter is Republicans have been saying to me for months that they that no single issue has been able to break through they really side uh they they took a heavy sigh\nOf relief when I was a cabinet confirmation hearings seemed to raise Republican enthusiasm that seems to have faded now when we looked at our polling and in fact tax cuts you know the thing that a lot of Republicans really were hanging their hat on thinking there this is going to be the thing a lot of people are going to like not ...\nRight not resonate only eleven percent of people in our poll said that it's a factor in their vote\nBy the way more people said that they that it made them more likely to vote for a Democrat tax cuts than for Republican and one more point on that\nIs that when Mitch McConnell says

started a little league and the the earth that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes\nYes they receive a really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he did play in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so both of them were signing sixteen and they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was relief and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit\nIn a classroom with high school kids I'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who paid euros and it just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives\nWhat could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping our young people who may hope to go on to major

maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball\nPlayers but is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids could be realistic\nAnd as American all dirty teams of ammo will be have academies where they signed the players so there is a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many things that's going to be me one day [laughter]\nDo

lamenting when he talks about privacy or things that in some ways the iPhone enables by merging you towards\nUsing Google Search in some settings but I think that it speaks to the bigger issue here which is that\nFor many of these companies they're troubles with governments are very complex and they're pretty wide ranging\nShould any tech company be framing the conversation right now especially a conversation about regulation on privacy\nWell whether they should or they shouldn't be framing it they certainly are and that's because these companies don't want to be regulated in a way that affects their ability to collect information and monetize it and many of them are really worried in particular because of what happened in Europe and in California over the better part of the past few years\nYou're put in place very very tough restrictions on how companies can collect can use information and in California went and had ended its own version of that sort of the GDP ours we call it for the United states\nThese companies don't want to have to follow multiple sets of rules and different parts of the country so that's why you're seeing them talk so much about regulation because it's in their interest to set the rules to have a voice in the conversation so to speak so that they aren't burdened by uh the regulations put forward by governments\nThat stony rom tech policy

someone who cannot be a supporter of arabica grows or something like that because we want to spread the message\nWe're still can about freedom of speech was talking about human rights violation so we do not want to use the same language that they're using us you know against us\nWho are those people those pro Saudi or the employees are they commissioned by the crown prince NBS as he referred to him earlier how influential are the what are they doing\nSo here's the thing maybe people would find that strange but then Saudi Arabia we have no problem and so the only place where we can expose our

connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nTo try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest

NYPD detectives or with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force Jay ... New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since ...\nHey today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops when it comes to ... O'Neill NYPD please commit might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad are highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau or patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help\nI couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate it delivered a precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe\nBut it's direct ... said that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time\nWe've been you're listening to special coverage of the Justice Department at press conference on NPR and\nSee our city always you also to the media for broadcasting the photos NYPD released because it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and help move forward with this investigation thank you very [noise]\n\nGood afternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district of New York\nFive days ago on October twenty second law enforcement recovered the first device from a resident of George Soros\nOver the last five days as more packages were found across the country delivered to former presidents federal officials in public figures are law enforcement community federal state and local has work day and night\nTogether with other prosecutors from my office to identify and apprehend the perpetrator that has now happened\nToday my office has filed a complaint against Caesar say are charging him with multiple federal crimes for the city of conduct [noise]\nSpecifically to the Senate is charged five towns that include illegally mailing an interstate transportation of explosives and threatening a former president of the United states [noise]\n\nAs a legend a complaint the defendant male destructive devices to citizens of this country who currently hold or have held our highest public offices president Brock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder\nCongress person Maxine Waters US Senator Cory Booker former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nThe defendants conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema\nTo our democracy and now the defendant faces a potential total fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThis is an ongoing an active investigation we will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated and the defendant or defendants are brought to justice\nI Want to take a moment to thank our partners the joint terrorism task force the FBI the NYPD US postal inspection service New York state police the ATF\nThe hard working career prosecutors and investigators and the terrorism unit of the southern district of New York and I also like to thank the extraordinary cooperation we receive from the southern district of Florida thank you [noise]\nThat afternoon\nScott ... deputy chief nine states post inspection service um first of all like me and my colleagues I like to thank all of our federal partners who participated in this nation wide investigation FBI ATF Secret Service [noise]\nNew York police department and and diminished thing local law enforcement agencies are provided by bill assistance Chile I can say this is the way law enforcement supposed to work this was a mass of investigation what's the what's a collaborative effort and was well coordinated with each agency bringing a special expertise to the table\nBut also like to recognize the mini postal employees who we think of as a as an ears were appreciating the diligence and awareness in fact there was a postal employee this morning that alert us to one of these suspicious park ...\nWhere in the ... have a great deal of expertise in responding to an investigating suspicious mail pals suspect those are trained to wreck respond and investigate dangerous my items in the mail these dangerous ... specialists are highly professional and they used to stay are equipment\nFortunately in this case none of the devices detonated and there was no injuries\nHave a pulse those prices will remain villages and monitor postal facilities to determine whether they're additional ... that have not yet been discovered we will continue to work with law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the male our postal employees are customers and the American public\n[noise]\nAfternoon tax Dallas the secret service director\nJust as a uh the other speakers and understand it I just want to comment on the importance of cooperation near\nUh we were in the forefront of this uh what are receiving early packages on Tuesday and Wednesday and now fully engage the joint terrorism task force not our federal partners and just want to acknowledge the great work done by the FBI ATF the postal service and inspectors a New York city police Capitol police and then the different states involved in New York\nThat does sound good June theory Alice but of course we live in a very political politically divided world right hell I mean now that we are getting more information about the suspect we will learn more about his political beliefs in his background do you really think that that will bring down the political heat on this or just make it worse\nI Hope it brings it down and the way that that will happen is by our elected officials on both sides of the aisle calling for as we heard several times in that press conference\nA more more peaceful and unity amongst all all elected officials and uh the electorate\nBut there's another component to that I think it's important to note taking off my Republican had in my previous life as a journalist\nI I I think that the fact that two of these devices were sent to CNN it's important to also consider the component of an attack on free press and attack on journalists and an attack on the the the values that are the the news has\n... in our democracy and and I I'm so proud of my colleagues at CNN for nonstop coverage of this that meant as this was going on but\nBut what what you do every day and what Kerry does every day and the the journalists at NPR\nThat the value that they do as a free press I I I Hope that people understand the significance of that\nAnd the component here that two of these devices were sent to a news outlet and we saw the sticker on his car that was attacking CNN and and I I'm pleased to see that a Jeff Sessions or his first mention of those attacked here was a media outlet\nAnd I I think we need to consider that as well as a political component\nOf the Republican strategist Alex Stewart who want to go back now to Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent we heard um each of the speakers was quite a lot of tore tore his own organization an agency and into each others as well\nThis was obviously part of a very tight unit that work together but what happens now I mean they said they're they're pretty convinced that they have their man if it is just one person um but ... does the investigation continue at the same pace that it has been over the past few days what happens\nYeah I think it does continue at the same pace especially with respect to this idea that there may be other parcels or other suspicious packages out their authorities are worried about that they say they are not treating this as a hoax that under the right conditions these devices could in fact be dangerous to members of the public and they are going to be searching for those devices\nThey also want to get through all of this man's um communications his cell phone usage has tax they want to search his residence they want to search his vehicle and they want to talk to people who know him like his neighbors and family members to find out if he had any help\nAnd there's a lot of work to do in that regard\nMoving forward over the next several days remember as the authorities said in his news conference in New York the first suspicious package was uncovered only five days ago so they have gone from five days ago to now with a suspect in federal custody charged with fat or five felonies crimes by their work is not yet\nDone another important point that'd be a director

small spit of sand known as Easter Island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane will lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only slippers of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientists\nUniversity of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July when you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a block I knew it had headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might a head into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of hearing now dot org but tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place hum my research team which consists of a\nUndergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where the turtles could um big their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of San still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turned to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured that this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence I\nDidn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that yes\nIt was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary on his islands are at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average when speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... cents last year hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing\nOur fingers it looks as if the sand um was moved by the hurricane to the north north east\nThe trade when waves may push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a fall in sea level around two thousand years ago\nEffect let's take a look at some of those numbers of thirty year mortgage on a four hundred thousand dollar house in Providence Rhode Island now Twenty one thousand dollars more expensive and that's not even a very expensive city in relative terms or in Boston eighty four thousand dollars higher that makes a big difference\nIt does it does and like you said at the beginning the economy is strong unemployment is historically low the demand for houses shouldn't be there um it's just that all these issues make a homes more expensive\nAnd the builders of new homes are for obvious reasons going to be reluctant to cut prices to aggressively [noise]\nWe did see these solid GDP numbers today unemployment is still very low what is it what I mean what does it housing new say about the broader economy should we be concerned that things are starting to tip the wrong direction\nIt's definitely something to keep an eye on a one thing I've been looking at very closely is\nThe share prices of publicly traded a home builders there's an index of home builders stocks that's absolutely crashed this year it's down forty percent off so that signals to me that people believe these these builders are going to have to lower prices pretty aggressively really killing their profit margins\nAnd home building and housing is such an important element of the economy I don't need to remind anyone of its role in the financial crisis I'm so this is certainly a something that all of Wall Street I I can guarantee was keeping a very close eye on\nThe average rate on a thirty year fixed mortgage is about a percentage point higher today than it was a year ago that's going to make A People's monthly payments quite a bit more expensive as well so uh we'll thanks we're watching as far as my Greek and senior editor senior editor at Bloomberg News Mexican you're listening to hear
