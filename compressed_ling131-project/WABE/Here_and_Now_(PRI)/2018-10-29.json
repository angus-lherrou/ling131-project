somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware as a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians those who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nOr a political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders are present it as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it and they'll go to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that tourists began as\nWell uh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist

believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear that let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be telling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are already conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nShocked and I know NBC a discussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's\nBeen showing you the wrong tone has been settings said to myself what about cats\nHeard of that are not super calm and do you wish you didn't have to do this on Facebook Like is it I guess is it even worth it to try to do this on Facebook as their potential for it to get better\n... one of the big criticisms of Facebook is that they haven't shared enough data especially with academic researchers but also to some extent with fact checkers so it's really hard for me to say if things are getting better or worse\nI Can't say that subjectively it does feel like there are fewer outrageous posts being shared as real news on the platform so\nI Am an optimist and I do think that if we have robust fact checking on a platform that the quality of information on that platform will improve\nWhat do you think happens I mean there's one argument that everybody participating in fact checking program is basically just training Facebook's eventual artificial intelligence you know like what happens when Facebook says great thank you we've learned enough about you know how to detect false information and photos and we're just going to bring this into our machine learning\nWell I think that's a great outcome than we can move on to other types of fact checking\nBut overall I feel like this is a problem to be managed rather than solved\nIf you look at history if you look at other technologies such as the printing press there's always been problems with misinformation and the need for people to find ways to mark sources as\nCredible and authoritative so I don't see the problem that's on Facebook is going away it can get better but it's not going to go away\nThat the end you hold an editor at politifact tomorrow we'll talk to the producers of a new documentary called

on this day when many people are morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarette Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was\nAbout uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise]\nMy experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more in it\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that and draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shot started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside\nDogs' heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog somebody's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you're thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that was a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody else where the party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature\nA big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who\nIn trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I I kept thinking I should Google especially Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic Lee they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nThing that last year was that was one of the largest years for for threats and threats of violence against Jews I think they're almost two thousand incidents and\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because\nThese are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing in immigrants through a you know hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so they get a lot of the violent backlash and from from these white supremacist idea\n[noise] is this an unnerving time for you anyway\nYeah it's it's a hugely and every time for me and in part because when something\nWhen something like the synagogue shooting happened um I feel a haunted and depressed but I don't feel shocked um you know in order to feel shocked you have to be surprised and unfortunately these kinds of incidents are not surprising to me anymore and in fact it seems like there's a certain kinds of inevitability and that\nIs true in terms of mass shootings in general uh that that this country has not been able to address to solve them but it's also increasingly true in terms of veal acts of hate at you know I don't think that this will be the last one and and I think probably like a lot of us I sort of\nLive live in fear and with a sense of ... um when it's when it's an ex horrible thing like

the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island\nMay have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so\nThat also has to take into into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do in response is\nWe were able to create a resource center is who mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school into high schools you\nGot that teacher training there and other tools so willing people out here now doubt or the sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the gun in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S a bit less than half\nGet treatment so this is my also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and that you know there's opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nThink what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible again we don't want psychology when uh when we don't\nOn teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nAnd this unresolved issue with China is looming quite large remember\nTwo hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods we have terrorists in place those terrorists could rise from ten to twenty five percent in January\nAnd we also I hate to say this word because we haven't talked about in a while but we have a lot of uncertainty around Brexit and that has really prevent that a lot of companies for making major commitments till there's more information and these tax\nCuts have piled on the deficit um they're expected to reach a trillion one trillion next year you know Mitch McConnell the Republican leader talked about how the tax you know this a deficit increase was because of huge spending and Medicare and Social Security and saying that they had to be cuts to that to offset the um\nThe the debt others are saying it's a tax cut would expect to be the economic consequences\nWell I mean look I'm not one of these people who I interviewed tons of economists all the times and some of them are people who think that that's the to the worst thing in the world I don't think that death is are the worst thing in the world however it is mildly annoying that you have\nSomeone like McConnell start to blame the social safety net programs for a deficit one corporate tax receipts based on the left deficit numbers corporate tax receipts were down by thirty one percent\nSo yeah there is truth that the bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit\nCame because of corporate tax real quick you'll get twenty seconds can these be rolled back\nUp probably not because you really would need to see a big gains for the Democrats in the Congress and we don't have a a a veto proof majority
