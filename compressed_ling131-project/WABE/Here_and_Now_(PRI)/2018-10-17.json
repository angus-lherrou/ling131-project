yesterday we spoke of the director of the private and progressive little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that a gay their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\n... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise] um I think it was well intentioned\nAnd certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give black\nKids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity group thing not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise]\nOne of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black\nWomen are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior slain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is I don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a large\nThe black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school and if you are in a school like that the honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nA member in the book that you can read about that one too but uh it it was included in the magical mystery to films so it did go out on television but you didn't hear on radio at the time\nKevin hell thank you so much for talking to ... you know\nIf I Do as far\nAs that goes up\nAnd all\nOf

scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write attitude that I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and\nI have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius\nIn that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how did this start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of John Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the German Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from Bach let's just listen to a little\n\n\n\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program\nAnd to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks style\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of death than to say that had the feeling of October variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the faint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because there was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Joe it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had panned it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful\nBallet critic of her generation and you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called your Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up Robbins words as a belly choreographer\nThey haven't uh this is this initially when the Republicans saying it's not just that the president and Mitch McConnell we've had it from the treasury secretary at that this is this is due to spending which is largely driven by\nThe Democrats but actually if you look at the numbers at spending as it went up\nThree percent but government tax receipts was flat\nAnd they should have been going up this is a strong economy where people would be paying more taxes and you know there was some increases in individual in self employment taxes which were driven by economic growth but but the the bottom line is the corporate tax got isn't she made that council that\nOut so we have a station when tax receipts a flat display despite this been economy and that really can only be attributed to the gym tax cut\nWhat about the terrorists are they helping out at all to be charging a feed basically on all the goods coming in for example from China\nSo there is a section at the treasury app pulled out who's customs duties an excise taxes and they did say that the hurry fractional increase in tax receipts that we saw and physical twenty Eighteen at\nThat was partly due to an increase in those days at that may or may not be due to the highest it's difficult to know exactly ... that's potentially opposed to sign but that's not a part of this German when you look at the role of of the trade war with China is that China is still\nThe U.S as big as foreign credit to the biggest foreign and have US government bonds the more the you as far as\nThe more pain to countries like China and interest\nSo works both ways uh just quickly Seventeen percent increase overall and the deficit when was the last time we saw something like that\nSo that kind of dissent has jumped while a Senate it's a big one for this year is not entirely unusual in twenty Fifteen at when we saw the the usa deficit hit it hit a low that we hadn't seen since eleven and seven I jumped ... percent in twenty six but I think the point is this is a booming economy we don't need to be the right and\nOf course Avastin CNN Business correspondent thank you thank you you're listening to hear now [noise]\nAnd there's much more still

had\nInternational and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will ... so what do I now under routine other nobody cares still cares is you know you and a few people that us and question obviously the public didn't care because I Won the election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stopped delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHi Jeremy so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner um but it can important agents such as a staffer at outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think\nGiven the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee shared to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of\nIs ... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate that's exactly right so either committee or any\nThe committee's can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtained through the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a fall there\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it's searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here
