Baker and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke and would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\nNow ... says trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and\nAnd this does put her in a kind of awkward position\nThis socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter of the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no they're not close a Baker didn't vote for Trump as we mentioned he's opposed several of his policies\nBut he argues that when he can work with the Trump Administration when it helps Massachusetts he will but this is a state that voted two to one against Trump um so uh you know Baker has to do a bit of a balancing act you know when it comes to the president\nNow Massachusetts has a history of moderate Republican governors William Weld pulse solution even Mitt Romney who was governor in past Romneycare which was the model for Obamacare\nThat's right and Baker is part of that tradition of moderate Republicans that have had success in Massachusetts and across New England for that matter\nThey included people like late Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Olympia Snowe of Maine they were known as you know Rockefeller Republicans fiscally conservative more socially moderate even liberal Baker is part of that tradition\nIf fake or does when what is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states yeah the lesson is that Republicans\nAnd Democrats can overcome this hyper partisanship and work together and get things done I think that's one lesson that said bakers brand of moderate Republicanism is increasing increasingly rare once upon a time it represented a viable wing of the Republican Party that existed across the country but now that wing\nIs on the verge of extinction extinction so I think the lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker increasingly rare\nSaid that he Brookes senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston has any thank you my pleasure well a more traditional Republican is gaining ground on his Democratic opponent in the north Dakota Senate race Kevin Cramer is ahead of senator Heidi Heitkamp in the polls I kept one her seat in twenty twelve by fewer than three thousand votes and she had strong support\nFrom Native Americans which brings us to the Supreme Court which declined to consider a challenge to in North Dakota law that requires voters to show proof of their residential address at the polls\nRather than reflective of some kind of standards that are actually being enforced\nSo here's the deal with standards there is a federal process that tests and certified as these machines for accuracy security usability and vote auditing\nBut it's up to states to decide whether they want fully certified machines thirty eight states require at least one element of the certification program only twelve require the full federal certification and eight states including Florida and New Hampshire Oklahoma and Montana don't have any requirements at all\nAs for the vendors can soak says they don't really have the money to build cutting edge machines\nThe vendors are actually making their money from the technical services they provide to local governments for conducting elections\nAnd that's their steady stream of income so many of them are as far as we know because of their privately held companies are not doing very well and so they certainly cannot really afford to invest in software development at the level that we the public would wanna\nHook proposes that voting infrastructure should be regulated and funded like a public

have voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or making promises that they will continue one of the most popular parts of the law\nMaking sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance the Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions joining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Hi Julie\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in ... and who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions\nWell if you go from job to job issue I'd employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days that was a Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress bats\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves or or kids graduating from college and going off their parents' plans\nThe idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act\nBut back ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nOr possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right it it basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise]\nPretty much any time or the lawsuit suggests that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance\nThe entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down the Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh Fort ... but maybe they should strike down the pre existing condition protections so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the court\n... well that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take\nLittle pieces of it away well it it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry said we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax was about\nThat's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only sick people will sign up for individual health coverage because it's expensive or the insurance companies appear to be betting that they're going to continue to hang on to at least they all the people that they have because they're not raising premiums a whole lot for next year or we will see if that pays off we will know more about that in twenty Nineteen about how well that actually\nWorks meanwhile let's listen to what President Trump has been saying a here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nAs always protect\nPatients with pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\nSome\nPeople think that's not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republicans are coming into the position now all of them [noise]\nAnd we'll do it the right way\nPreexisting conditions are safe [noise]\nJulie is he right that all of the Republicans are moving into that\nPosition at this point well a lot of them are saying it but there are what they have done suggests otherwise and actually just yesterday the Trump Administration um put out a guidance that allows states to take these are short term plants that don't necessarily cover pre existing conditions and\nLet people get subsidies for them under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is not something that protects preexisting conditions it basically says that OK sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans in their premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters can sort that out [noise]\nAnd then I'm also going to be looking at all of these ballot initiatives in seven different states\nThat would potentially expand voting rights for millions of people I'm going to be looking at what's happening\nIn local races that have a huge impact on voting rights local secretaries of state races for example were Democrats actually have inability to take back the seats from Republicans and really critical swing states like Ohio and Michigan and Iowa and Georgia and so I'm going to be focused\nOn one hand on the potential threat of voter suppression but on the other hand I'm going to also be focused on the opportunity to expand voting rights for a lot of people so the ... election to go in two different ways\nIt could be tainted by voter suppression or it could be remembered as an election in which voting rights were expanded for millions of people\n[noise] Laurie Berman I Want to thank you so much for talking with us thank you so much for having me back Terry\nAri Berman is the author of give us the ballot the

it's the first east coast city to get scooters from left but scooters are already widespread in the nation's capital with companies like bird lime and skip already offering rent a boat dock all is electric scooters for short trips around the city\nJak Meridian is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joined us there Hi Jeff\nHi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately\nWell we currently have upwards of two thousand doc was vehicle\nBoth a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around we launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate the technology here in Washington DC\nAbout a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying well\nWe've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be be on to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them for periodic trips\nTo go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute the scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are a number of use cases that we have observed a over the past year\nAnd one of the things that a lot of cities have said about these scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and that clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that there\nThis is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and uh that it has become\nThat we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and\nWe see the incidents of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nA we have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that's correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was riding a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has\nDied in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters what do you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that\nDoesn't happen again it leads to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nShore well D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously to work with\nThe technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure uh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks\nAnd so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically ah to to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are a informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road\nWith one of the things that people have said about the the safety risk of the scooter is is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country are wearing helmets and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in D.C currently the law\nAnd DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize or riders to use helmets and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters\n[noise] you know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are always encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing helmets\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding\nAbout how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect [noise] it's it's very\nEarly to tell what what the impact will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling and to to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this in an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street to observe their use patterns but also to\nThey're kicking into the water treatment system and that's what they're trying to filter\nTo a level that would be a you know that's a good standard for for drinking and that is really difficult it takes a lot longer a and they're not able to filter it is actually where the last I heard they're not able to treat\nA the ... the amount of water that Austin typically uses in a day so they're they're looking at the essentially the city reserves drop\nThat was the last word from the water utility\nI see now we're seeing reports that coffee shops can't serve coffee restaurants are closed how is this affecting affecting businesses in town\nIt it it is kind of wild to see how they look kind of domino effect you know I didn't actually yesterday we saw kind of a rush on bottled water at the supermarkets that seems to have stabilized but yeah you go to a restaurant on my mom's visiting from out of time we went to a restaurant last night no ice for the cocktails right a\nCafes absolutely close are you 'cause you have most of them are not boiling the amount of water they would need to in order to be able to serve the volume that they they typically serve\nUm and so yeah there's just a lot of a lot of different it impacts here\nAnd it's not just restaurants in businesses it's every day people that you know you live in the city you you got to deal with this deal yeah I mean are\nThey asking people to conserve conserve conserve\nA skip my shower this morning or you know we're we're just we're trying to to lower the amount of water that were taking out of the system because like I said they're concerned about their ability to treat and put it back in and then of course if you are taking water from your tap you do need to boil it because they're not able to get\nThe uh uh the amount of kind of ... to this ah particulate matter out that they'd like to\nAnd just real quick any word when the order will be lifted\nLast I heard if he'd be

how 'bout Patrick McGovern\nHe founded a company called international data corporation back in Nineteen sixty four it produced magazines like computer world Mac world and PC World and similar publications around the world\nBut government who died in twenty fourteen became a billionaire as the company grew and author Glenn risking has just written a book about him called future forward Glenn Rifkin welcome to hear now\nThanks Jeremy it's great to be here so Patrick McGovern not a household name but very important guy who was he\nWell he was the entrepreneur and visionary who started a company called international data group I D G and what he saw was that the information technology revolution was getting started in the early sixties it was slow and\nSteady but he saw something bigger happening and over those years he decided that somebody needed to tell the story of this revolution it was one thing to be the bill gates or the Thomas Watson junior who made things the software and hardware\nBut somebody needed to chronicle what was going on and that was his mission\nSo he created computer world magazine computer world and Mac\nCreated actually nearly three hundred publications around the world over the course of fifty years running the company but yes the first publication was computer world\nWhich became the Bible of the information technology industry what was in it what what would you find in computer well it was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly it was\nTaking a look at the people and players in the industry the companies that were moving and shaking um they\nWere big uncovering IBM in the late sixties into the seventies when they were the eight hundred pound gorilla in the in the industry space [noise] um and as it moved along as the industry changed the personal computer was created in the Nineteen eighties\nComputer world would would be the newspaper of record so to speak it was kind of the New York times of the computer industry while I was also thinking about it in comparison to Bloomberg\nUh which you know people on Wall street they've all got these Bloomberg terminals which they pay a lot of money for just to get information so they have the latest information is that the same kind of thing who is he talking to with computer world than Mac world\nWell if you're older Mac world would be slightly different audiences Mac world was really aimed right away at the apple marketing backing it started on the day they release the Macintosh computer and like a tendency for investors or who this would have been the computer world was aimed early on at data processing managers deep ... managers who morphed into\nWhat we now think of the CIA does chief information officer as\nIt wouldn't ... there were no terminals\nI'm set up like Bloomberg this was strictly a newspaper\nSo they obviously it's strictly on line but you know over the course of those three or four decades computer world was a print publication\nAnd it was aimed at at offering technology people an insight into what the products were who is using them how they were using them\nAnd they made the big leap which was an important leap in showing that these guys were not just techies\nHidden behind glass walls these people were going to contribute big time to the business because technology was going to drive things and you worked there a computer I did I joined in Nineteen eighty three at the time didn't know a computer from a washing machine\nIf I could turn on the on switch I always have\nA never dreamed of getting involved in the technology industry but I got a job there at a time when jobs were a little bit scarce and ended up just loving it because something really exciting what's happening I started interviewing Bill Gates and Steve Jobs before the New York times and Wall Street journal did\nSo I was you know right there as I say in the book at the tip of my keyboard things were happening and I stayed there for seven years at which time during which time I got to know pat McGovern [noise] so what was it about him that was so special\nWell there's lots of visionary slots entrepreneurs out they've done great things but had had a very unique style of management and leadership which is what the book is about that he saw the world differently he didn't need to be in the spotlight what he wanted was to fulfill a mission\nAnd one of the keys to him to feel fulfilled his mission was to treat his employees around the world in a way that most companies did and this was a guy uh for example\nAt the holidays he would go around to every office in the United states we're talking about five thousand people at the time he would go to every desk\nHe would meet and greet every employee he knew if you would work there before and he'd see any of the year before he not only remember your name he knew your wife's name he knew how many kids had [noise]\nHe would congratulate you on some project that you did and he would thank you for the contributions you are making to the company and then he would hand you a holiday card which was stuffed with cash holiday
