K. bench pass it\nWe are all here yes yes Justin Paul hello there even lettuce and hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIt's not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were ah myself included\nAnd I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up everyday China have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen your kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmates but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I Know he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\n\n\nTo how you were able to those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moment on the musical\nDo you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to distribute different ...\nFrom the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nSo Google knew about this and there was a a memo that the wall Street Journal change it said if Google had disclosed the breach when it first found out about it almost guaranteed that the c._e._o. would be called before Congress so it sounds like and this does not sound good that Google wanted to keep this very much quiet\nRight well think about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg had to testify before Congress in April he certainly didn't seem to enjoy that experience in fact I can remember this moment toward the end when one of the members of Congress\nSaid to them hey you know we would take your suggestions but other tech CEOs we should hear from in a setting like this and I sort of read the stock bubble bugs October and that is like yeah I'd love to see some of these other guys after squirm in this chair nobody wants to get called before God\nNobody wants to sit there and it turns out nobody wanted to use Google Plus either\nRight I mean it's sort of a low paying way for Google to be responsive to the problem I mean it doesn't hurt to shut down to a service that really didn't have a lot of traction anyway they said that Ninety percent of Google Plus sessions last less than five seconds it's practically an accident when somebody clicks on Google Plus out at this\nPoint it was supposed to be an answer to Facebook at the time it did not work out um what other changes if any can we expect from the company\nWell Google are saying it's going to give customers more power to control the individual bits and pieces of their account privacy so for example in the past when you've had an app request access to your Google Account it's been kind of an all or nothing proposition\nNow you can grab partial access going forward so maybe yes to view in my calendar no to looking at the documents on my Google Drive\nAnd I say OK to kill them ...

from Syria Iraq into Africa\nHave arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore yeah clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program has drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidences but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their team took care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story when she was working in Africa\nAnd does this cause was she was asked to do a severe infection I'm a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult and desperate\nSaying that in this Hippocratic Oath ear able to give her permission to say I can't\nWrite up exactly writes a defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nDo you think this is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point the our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\n[noise] one of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece up pretty homogenous white community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen press that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate but the show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHave grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the fall it's me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they have married someone from outside Greece these workers you're talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have known him for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to
