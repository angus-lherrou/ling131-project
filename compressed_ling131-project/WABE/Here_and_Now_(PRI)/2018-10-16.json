experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room after the parents are the minority students objected\nCasson is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\n... well you said that a part of this was based on that you know research this was an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in this but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves and the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school a that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that\nBeing part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like\nThat they could go to so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the act\nImmigrant electoral experience for having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experiences and let's say the teachers are white and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those ends even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior class to fight itself for several minutes everyday along racial or gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know do you worry about the width of that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you're you know those people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nAbsurd six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety W.
