five tarnished Wayne Kramer prolific solo artist years he's here to talk about his new memoir the hard stuff do\nCrime the MC five and my wife of impossibility I think first Greg we have to start with who was the MC five the motor city fought\nRock band out of Detroit\nYoung musicians looking to make an incredible noise building on the music of the fifties taking it in New directions with touches a free jazz and what would come to be called punk rock\nArriving at a time probably the most controversial year in American history up until recently Nineteen sixty eight\nThe wake of riots in a major American cities including Detroit high to Vietnam\nWar the aftermath of the civil rights movement the Democratic national convention here in Chicago\nThe MC five never hit it big commercially as as was expected by many people until years later when generations of musicians have since taken inspiration from their work\nPunk rock in the seventies and you know the ... or the purge editors in England Sex Pistols clash groups in the alternative ever like mud honey or rage against the machine there dozens and dozens of artists who have taken inspiration from what they did the emcee fought in Detroit in the sixties\nSo it's a fifty year anniversary general that debut album ... kick out the gyms was recorded fifty years ago this month\nThat was a you know we talk about a calling card right ah it was chaotic very live you've got the sense of being at that Grande Ballroom watching this band at its peak there was also a political veneer\nAs well that could not be discounted the the ... the ban was associated with the white panther movement their manager John Sinclair was noted radical and self described revolutionary he wrote the liner notes for for a kick out the jams and the emcee but happily went along\nMuch to their chagrin do or the establishment didn't like it so much\nI mean the big department store in Detroit Hudson's for example wouldn't carry it because of some of the outspokenness I mean the FBI investigated this bad ... the FBI file yeah so you know when Cramer talks about his days in the Detroit seen his struggle with drugs and alcohol addiction his time in prison\nIn his memoir and he also talks about his career as a solo artist and music composer for a film and TV\nNow Wayne is currently on tour celebrating fifty years of kick out the gyms and we'd like to welcome to sound opinions Wayne welcome to the show\nThanks guys have happy to be with you all always happy to speak to you to\nWeigh in let's start at the beginning the MC five comes together around a cast of young mayor do well and the Detroit area Fred sonic Smith a guitar with you Michael Davis on base you on guitar and vocals Dennis Thompson on drums and the great\nRob Steiner as to lead vocal is part of what I loved about the MC five is it you guys were not polished specifically ... he had these glasses this weird wild afro he was kind of a chubby your guy he didn't fit the mold of a rock star God like Robert Plant\nNo but he was the world's greatest rock front man yes 'cause he looked like nobody else he sounded like nobody else and he had a a vivid clear vision\nOf the future of rock and and where he wanted to go with it I mean he wore glasses and he had a gap in his teeth and you know this is the big shoulders and this little tiny waste skinny legs and he wasn't like\nDirect from central casting that's for sure we worked hard to develop on an idea about what our band was trying to do and and what our message was and it was a message of self advocacy and self determination\nAnd that you could change the world if you get a phone measures you know if you've kicked out the jams\nHoly and completely you could make something happen [noise]\n\n\n\nIf it forces you know when a lot of fans in the late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical revolution as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War [noise]\nSpiro Agnew was vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new ... says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that does make some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar of the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time [noise]\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbed\nThe power structure but clearly used everything they had against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nWhy Africa I wanted to know to what extent he blames the crazy rock and roll scene and the atmosphere of that time for any of the challenges he went through personally with drugs and alcohol\nTo zero extent I I don't I don't blame the arch up for my\nLapses in rational thought or\nOr or principles that's the defects a character that I developed on my own power saw you know I created most of the trouble in my own life and not all of it I I put a fair amount of it or a ride on the doorstep of the war on drugs\nOr which caused me immense anguish over my life and still pains me\nTo see that we have to point three million of our fellow citizens are in prison and in jail and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo obviously policy ... but he went to prison anyway and I ... a barrel cocaine he went for two years of Lexington federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky if you know some people\nTalk about how miserable they weren't prison and it's ... the sense I got to reading your telling of it in the hard stuff\nIs that there were some good stuff that came out of there for you personally you know I don't know rehabilitation has the right word or but there was some learning going on you made good use out of those years that you were in prison [noise] am I reading that correctly\nWhile humans are enormously resilient and able to find value and meaning an enjoyment in the most terrible circumstances\nAnd people in prison do right now as we speak they have the same fears and ambitions as we do out here and in fact we're all the same ... um they made a serious mistake no doubt but um there are still just regular people\nAnd yeah I I was able to to use the time to improve my job skills took advantage of every program that they\nMade available to me and I tried to understand what was wrong with me and what could I Do to make sure I never came back to these penitentiaries again\nMhm [noise] I mean obviously at work you never you didn't end up in prison again um\nWell it worked ... years right yeah I mean I don't believe president helps anybody number I think it may have saved my life because I was doing my worst drinking and drugging in those days and the people I was hanging out with were very dangerous people\nSo it's it's save me in that sense but these are dangerous places where you're never safe or you're embarrassed jury mask elated you are powerless and here in a world of the violence or racism bitterness and defeat\n[noise] and ah nobody out ... better [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nSmashed yelled shark ... you know a sort of the nation\nYou in Philly brag a address idea can we bring music to these people behind bars shit\nWe do is pretty simple we find people that work in corrections that are willing to use music as a tool for rehabilitation today our instruments are in over a hundred and twenty American jails and prisons what we do and besides just supply\nThe instruments is we operate songwriting workshop programs which are self expression programs\nUm where we can help one learn how to express complex\nAnd uncomfortable feelings in a positive way ... you know everybody has the story and everyone's story needs to be told and it's the beginning of the hard work of positive change you know most people in prison\nThey don't like being there and they don't want to be in prison and uh if you give them the tools and the incentive they will make the changes they need to make sure\nThey don't come back should be terrible [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know it's\nInteresting because the politics and the arts and the music show there was a it was a huge melting pot of that in in Detroit and [noise] you know you think about back on that here uh it's it's such a collection of characters I mean between the MC five [noise]\nAnd what was happening and Motown which is extraordinary but then you've got you know the the one of us are ... pop telling me or any any chance he got\nHow good the MC five were to him and his band that couldn't get a leg up here was these guys who were made it or we're perceived to be making it\nGiving a hand up to a a a baby band that was trying to find his way you know aids become obviously you're getting used to be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the band and and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances with I mean he's one of the great front men of all time um\nUh so yeah of course if or when\nDanny field so does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five Richard ...\n[noise]\nAll you know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same Coltrane and sunrise and we all smoked the same passion we always have the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city":
