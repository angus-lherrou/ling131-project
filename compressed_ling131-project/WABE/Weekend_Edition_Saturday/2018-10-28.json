littering the sea floor\nChan who's now co chair of the California hypoxia toss suppose says the question is why why is this happening\nOne of the more fundamental reason is that the ocean is warmer now and warmer water holds less auction and then the second part is that a warmer surface ocean it acts as an insulating blanket\nScientists say climate change is behind this the oceans have been absorbing nearly all the rising heat from greenhouse gas emissions and is projected to grow even warmer in coming decades Oregon State university oceanographer jak Baugh thinks the higher temperatures

of life synagogue in that city six people injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it as a hate crime\nWill be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly live [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well let me know is that a lead\nAnd people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services and we'll be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nI'm and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah what are they mention there will\nBe a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing that community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\n[noise] well it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania\nWolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life um something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nI also want to thank window his ... his team they are a big part of the community that all law enforcement promises to protect and serve thank you very much alternative ...\n[noise]\nThe morning [noise] I Would just like to take a few minutes and thank the outpouring of support that we've received over the last twenty four hours\nYou're Jewish community center of the red cross Salvation Army the various grief counselors the children's Institute and the many other organizations and businesses that provide food and logistics for for the officers and for the victims\nAs Mr Jones mentioned the area around Wilkinson shady will remain closed so that the forensic investigation of the crime scene\nWindow switch Pittsburgh public area right now probably remain closed\nFor up to a week extra patrols had been assigned around various sensitive locations throughout the city of Pittsburgh to include where the scheduled event Walker tonight\nAnd the next few minutes a medical examiner or released the names of the deceased victims\nI Would personally asked that the media respect the privacy of the families of these victims I was there last night and witnessed the notifications being made to the families is a very difficult time for the families and I asked you to give them some distance\nFinally if you see a first responder whether it be a police officer paramedic or firefighter go up to them and say thank you\nFor their work that they've done the last twenty four hours has been extremely stressful for them and awarded thanks would go a long way at this time I turn it over the Pittsburgh your police chief Scott Schubert who will give you an update on his officers thank you [noise]\nHere listening to special coverage from more than the army's\nA first and foremost is 'cause everybody's saying or a heartfelt\nCondolences to the victims in to their families and their friends and we have a of a strong relationship with the Jewish community in Pittsburgh and I just want to tell them that we agree with you\nWe support you and we're here few we will continue to work with you\nUh this is a tragic [noise] a thing for everybody but it's something that makes Pittsburgh strong is that we work together so we are going to continue to do that uh I I still want to praise the officers for what they did a I mean they ran into danger they ran into gunfire to help others\nOr some of that training some of that experience\nBut it's their inner core that wants to them\nTo help others that wants to save lives and they did that yesterday so we want to praise them for that\nOr the four officers were injured one was released yesterday uh we're praying one will be released today\nAnd then the other to have a little bit more that that needs to be done and can't say enough for the the medical staff

because we worked together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal should the state to the county to the local\n[noise] to help us make sense since something so senseless hum we are now joined by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson um and to put this into context as well because there were package bombs sent a prominent Democrat this past week and uh this is affecting our political discourse in our political leaders good morning Mara\nHigh ... President Trump held a political rally in Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say yeah let me just say if you thought first of all my mom grew up in the Jewish\nI mean he he uh Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in this world hill and what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too\nHorrific violent acts and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out against what he's called pure evil\nBut he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual at his rallies with a little less vitriol he said last night at his rally in Illinois I'm going to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we're going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan the short shoulder championships Berg also posted on\nSocial media that Jews were funding the caravan he particularly I was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nAnd the Kevin McCarthy the majority leader\nIn the house has been tweeting how Soros dire and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is\nPretty coated anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about whether the president's words words of other\nPeople helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened\nBut there is what he says and then there is what people here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns in the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer [noise] so [noise]\nTen days nine days out from the election we've got the situation to process and try to figure out how to stop in the future\nAnd Mara let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the synagogue is supposed to be the synagogue just at the community\nTo the community I mean you mentioned that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away will the events of this past week affect the elections and if so how\nWell I don't know I think the easy answer those that quick answers to said that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nOf the house looks like it's trending to the Democrats the Senate looks like it's trending to the Republicans\nBut it might have some effect\nI mean this once again through us gun violence into the political debate some people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings maybe that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that it makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe didn't have momentum and now this bomb thing happened and that's all the media is talking about you and listening to special coverage from NPR News\nSupport for W.

A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello so the medical let's start with you who the candidates\nAnd the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black and female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression of who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin ... have sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the selection comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams ended the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that\nHer group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ...\nStreet as complex to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate assembled to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStacey Abrams equal to them being rating liberal extreme them campaigned with you know\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talked a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill led Abrams has to climate she's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

happen on election day just about a week\nFrom everything ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has it at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night for\nThe new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and he worked for already confirmed this this election is all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I got a like a mother was\nRunning me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans snoop all this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nAnd do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with you Scott ... everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become\nThe worst health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think\nOf another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same or reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether and we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible\nProblem so what are some specific things that this law does one\nOf the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage which was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addiction\nBack to the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this uh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies\nAdditional measures including new enforcements drinks for the United States Postal service so but they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids\nThis bill or it signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling\nOff yes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nA data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate that the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years he used the word plateau\nAnd that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand from sixty four thousand the previous year\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last months of Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen\nSo if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together\nPeople saying look what we need here is to back up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just stitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say\nThere needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank you Scott\n[noise]\nThis
