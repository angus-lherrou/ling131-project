and thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me and what your immediate reaction to senator Manchin Cheney intends to vote for drugs capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah it's been indicated also\nI mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia and twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express part of the people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabin on people mostly most people supported Kevin here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or ... that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did that to him yesterday on\nThursday we'll tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we get so we had a group of women who sat in his office by day and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go out\nOn Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on my two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he got away he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the room but the fact that get over that you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah\nIt was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that John mentioned cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes you're probably continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers\nAre fight does continue to sell a at first the Senate goes he he kind of knew that he had a he kind of habits because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has\nDone terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so you kind of your nose and believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia He's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and he's just a bad guy and I think he knows that\nSam ... this is your opinion with me underscore that\nOf course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue her yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to take things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe that just that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if your Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions vote for what it is and I'm Still
