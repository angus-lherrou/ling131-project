popular course at Rollins which isn't surprising how did you decide to teach a class about zombies though is this a bait and switch to get students to read Aristotle\n[laughter] no it's not a bait and switch we actually talk about zombies I came upon the idea because I was trying to figure out what is the nature of consciousness\n... give us an example of the kinds of things that you are grappling with\n[noise] so most people\nAnd students included\nTake consciousness to simply be awareness but scientists are now thinking of consciousness as the result of the neurological energy in our brains so in the class we go inside of the brain and we talk about the of all the brain and the owner of all of the brain\nTo give students the tools to talk about things like consciousness and freedom and responsibility\n... is the idea that does on these are basically these kind of mindless flesh eating monsters and we're not clear how much um they're aware of the things that they're doing\nThat's exactly right yes I was a good student [laughter]\nWe often ignore the unable to brain or what's sometimes called the reptilian brain so zombies exist in the reptilian brain in the movies and as it turns out in the real world humans have\nWhat we sometimes referred to as our zombie brain and you might think about it as auto pilot\nLike when you're driving the car and you sort of zone out and you don't even remember the way that you got to where you're going\nThat's the perfect example\nAnd the real world applications for the speculation right because there are murder cases where the perpetrator says that they zoned out and there's a big debate about how conscious they were of what they were doing\n[noise] there is a famous case called the ... parks case\nIn which he zones out and kills his father in law and almost killed his mother in law after looking into his history we find that he had a history of sleepwalking\nAnd the case has referred to as homicidal some number ... meaning homicide while sleepwalking\nThe Miami Herald profiled you this past week which is where we heard about your class and you had some advice for those of us fearing the coming zombie apocalypse and I count myself among them [laughter] so how should we survive [laughter]\nOkay so\nIf I was on the apocalypse hit you need food and water shelter and of course ammunition to fight off designed the attack and the the place that I could think of that would have plenty of it and a lot of space for you to move around as Walmart so often tell people\nGo to Wal Mart hunker down\nAnd fight it out for

begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if this generation will reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nPicture an upscale use hostile with more than a dozen twin beds and a

entrepreneur building in business that doesn't want to deal with Iran right now but rain here\nCosts fourteen hundred dollars a month in a city with a housing shortage and a neighborhood where the average apartment costs a lot more that's a good deal for Hewitt\nMy gosh so I'd love to city apartments in this area in Hollywood downtown I mean we're looking at almost two thousand dollars a

affordability is relative rent start at twenty two hundred dollars a month on a sticker shock level the prices here are not perfect\nI think this trend that fits very hand in glove with the sense that we are now moving into inexperience economy rather than a possessions economy\nShe'll probably teaches interior design at Florida State university\nYou know that this is tied to for example the tiny house movement and you know a great emphasis on travel these days the sharing economy I think is also a player here as well\nMy name's Mike blue go look for in a meal for the jobs where the Saudis

at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival down over his long used\nFor\nIt pleases self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on

Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overuse identity and we can\nBring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill methods in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids\nHealth care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who's best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should on to your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identity\nRight now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody or one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that intellect from re vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real note of concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nNo I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nBlur [noise] with kinda like the turning point when I wrote that so that was just about the time where I started to

downs in this race but it's got what specifically are you looking for between now and November six that you think maybe you could give us somewhat of a clue about what will happen election day\nWell one of the one of the biggest things that we saw this week was just the insane amount of money the Democratic candidates have had brought in house candidates all over the country bringing in\n... the the type of money that sometimes you see Senate can candidates bringing Senate candidates in beta Iraq's case bringing in presidential campaign level numbers there is just a ton of donor enthusiasm on the Democratic side the Kennedy type a ton of money\nTo my question is what are they going to do with this at a certain point you can't buy more TV ads all the TV Time is taken up\nSo how do they use this money do they use it on on door knocking on get out the vote efforts do they use it on digital advertising I'm just really curious to see where that money goes and how they can leverage that advantage that they have because again the the divide between the party and fundraising was was really striking\nAnd also can they spend it in a way that lays down some permanent infrastructure for Democrats in states where they haven't had much of one\nYeah given again is there something that you really watching these last couple of weeks\nOkay look the fact is you're now starting to hear that\nTurn out in this election could be a record could be as high as it's been since the mid Nineteen sixties another time of social and cultural upheaval I talked to Michael McDonald who's\nA turnout expert at the University of Florida keeps the big turnout database that everybody looks at her and he said that he's looking at essentially for markers for indicators for why he thinks that turnout going to be that high for mid term okay\nSo that there was record special election turnout high primary turnout a high degree of self reported interested in the election and\nHigh levels of early voting and we're seeing intensity and all of those metrics absolutely and he said when all four of those are pointing in one direction he said you know look it just seems to point to the fact that this is this could be an election that is higher turnout than most people have seen in their lifetimes perimeter\nAnd we should explain that even higher turnout in and meet your needs somewhere between forty five fifty percent of the electorate voting and\nMarlene are you watching I'm watching the immigration debate\nI think that now that the Brett Kavanaugh moment has come and gone I'm not saying it didn't\nHelp Republicans get more energized but I Do think that Donald Trump is looking for another culture war issue that he can use to energize his base that's fascinating the caravan of\nPeople coming through Mexico from Central America on ... potentially on their way to the U.S border is something that he's been tweeting about I think that what we've seen is when the immigration debate focuses on border security\nUm or abolishing ice than Republicans when when the immigration debate focuses on taking kids away from their parents\nDemocrats win so I'm watching that a caravan of potential immigrants to the U. S. and seeing if it's gonna blow up into a big issue before election\nDay that's really interesting and it's also an issue that I think makes Donald Trump feel very comfortable right like this is what he ran on\nWell he's a culture warrior and immigration was his number one issue he wrote down the golden escalator and said Mexico was sending rapists do the United states\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that is fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court [noise] All right that was NPR's Scott Detrow Jim ... and Mara Liasson thank you all very thank you You're welcome\n[noise] in in\nIs a politician show from NPR I must have a holiday it feels like every week there is one major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories often get overlooked\nWe dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving hair on her to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn\nHe left his job this week as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise in white matter estate left\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... baloney\nOr who is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nShe like as in listening to describe all of this field Harry inside or ... to me right in terms of who's who and who they all watch for and and it sounds sort of like we're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in up pretty high powered job that\nThat maybe doesn't resonate for most folks and is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and I was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court an appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier I mean there Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed you did and that was apparently can don't within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of the twenty sixteen Trump campaign or does it mean something else and\nWe should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much um the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you though about the job itself did die again represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he rapper that Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but\nIf he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that's ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this off his way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lines never been easy but it's never been more important\nWell thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches us up on some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening [noise] think Iraq pick you [noise]\nThis is

body so pull up a seat at the table\nAnd joined me for political breakfast\nAny time it's like a twenty four hour diner\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio [noise]\nDon't know what they're doing [laughter]\nA little bit about what the social media platforms themselves they're doing with these tech giants are doing I knew our colleague Tim Mak\nDid spend some time at Facebook just this past week and Facebook is sort of counting this election security war room that they've developed\nBut I'm curious if any of you have a sense of how successful because to some degree also you know the Russians and whoever it is is trying to interfere could extensively just invent new tricks\nWhat the platform so focused on his transparency so they're responding in the way that of the American political system has historically a to campaign influence issues where if you buy an ad that says Obama is a part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nFacebook once you'd have to disclose who you are and thereby disclose the origins of that type of messaging so that will be in place for political campaigns going forward but in real time when your scrolling through your Facebook feed\nWho's actually going to look at that and do the research and say aha this appears to be a foreign influence campaign if it's going to have an effect it's not going to stop the problem and it's not going to keep our information environment in the United states pristine in any way\nOn a slightly depression or one of the questions that I always like to ask a Social Security people when I when I meet with him and talk to them is are these sorts of operations is this just the sort of world that we live in now and\nReally there is no way to to and there's no way to combat this to the point where it's not going to be an issue and the depression answer that I generally get is this is pretty much the world we live in\nIt's like you're constantly playing defense you can never really entirely fix the problem right you're just sort of trying to to blockade is that\n... yeah that's a good example is\nIt's a dilemma that counterterrorism professionals have talked about for many years because we have an open society we have freedom of movement we have freedom of speech you can go wherever you want within reason and and the old days we worried about terrorists exploiting that these days we're worried about foreign governments exporting that because they can move much more quickly than Facebook and Twitter can to clamp down on them\nAnd I'm the U.S government really has no way to stop that from taking place\nI got to tell you that as somebody who sometimes goes out in the world to speak at places other than Washington DC I Know that we have listeners who I teach high school and college history or American studies or social studies and at the high school and the college level\nThey are trying to educate people young people about how to recognize some of these phony mediums and information warfare attacks\nTo try to get out the problem that way before people start logging into Facebook and believing what everything that they read there's actually a real kind of effort it civics education out they're aimed at young folks to try to get them to recognize these things that are targeting them everywhere they go\nAnd that's a wonderful but it's also if it's like a generational struggle that's it's going to take years and years to to get an educated voting populace that's conscious of such things\nJust to kind of wrap that the conversation here it sounds like the interference that we are seeing is is really just essentially on the information level the information and public space but it it's not really a matter of voting like if if I Am a vote or going to vote there's not a real threat to election security and that way it is that right\nAccording to what these national security agency set on friday they haven't identified any cyber attack that is going to result in a vote being changed so if you go to the polls and you try to vote for your member of Congress what the government is saying is they don't have any evidence that that vote will not be counted as you intended\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way that votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you all so much thank you thank you thank you All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race of the week [noise]\nThis against these people and these are held we will never found out\nThe way but [noise]\nIt really we focus on one race in the country then indicative of a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey I'm here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez\nHe's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here [noise] you mean you could start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that he is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director of national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district and became took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all\nWay to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this time I mean given ever talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across
