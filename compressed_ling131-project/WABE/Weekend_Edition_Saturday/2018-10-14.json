progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states and so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think are really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then it Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races\nWere talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions\nMaryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont still Scott are all favorites to win reelection they could flip the seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank\nYou so much thank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants and their jails the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats with member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned it into a political firestorm\nThe issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nThe agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwarz of the county shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn using night because you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get down here in a county we can we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nDam holding it up there you can tell that there is a river here underneath this reservoir because it has somewhat of a linear pit\nWorks on Colorado River policy for the national Audubon Society this past year was one of the driest on record and this spring the reservoir only received about a third of the amount of water it does in an average year\nDemands for the rivers water continue to outstrip the supply

happened that would be a\nFor this region's economy for all of the people who depend on the Colorado River and for all the wildlife that depends on it as well\nMore is being taken out and comes into

talking about water\nFor forty million people and it's a condom use that are massive a fifth largest economy in the world to the Colorado River basin represents\nA then that's significant acklin banking analogy is appropriate because the creation of a water account in Lake Powell is one piece of so called drought contingency plans in the works now\nThe plans basic premise is simple get states to voluntarily cut their water use now to avoid even more severe cut backs in the future ... cute as the former manager of the Colorado River district\nThere's clearly a enough evidence that if we were to have another two thousand two thousand four kind of you know multi year drought the system isn't very serious trouble\nArizona has had the hardest time coming to an agreement figuring out the details of weather cities or farmers get their water allocation cut by how much and when but states in the rivers upper basin like Colorado have had issues to for example this thing called demand management\nIt's a difficult one it's somebody's gonna have to use less\nAnd productions aren't doled out fairly ... says there's a fear they could injure urban and rural economies throughout the southwest\nBut the thing we have to remember is the base and is over eighty percent agriculture holy\nPublic Reno is with the Las Vegas metro areas water utility she says current conservation programs like hurt agencies aggressive buyback of residential lawns won't be enough to avoid a crisis\nSo we can take out all the lines we want and still not solve the problems that climate change is going to throw at us\nClimate change is one factor adding pressure to get these deals done quickly another the federal government the U.S department of the interior wants the state water managers to finish the

where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked\nUtility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about one in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic

people going after him saying he was spring on violence and he said they should stop the fake outrage but certainly feeling them\nAnd it it seems like of this moment people are tired when you talk about civility when you talk about uh going high they're saying that didn't work for it and they're saying that the other side has not done that so they would argue that the Republicans have not gone high that the Tea Party was not polite\nThat President Trump is not civil and he's he's not always polite and he says a lot of things are so why shouldn't they fight fire with fire\nWill also when I talked to activists up here a couple of them said to me that there don't see a point in being polite when they feel like they're ... they're very real risks to some of their core beliefs in the political system right now and then when\n... when President Obama was being polite it was when he was in power and that there's just simply a difference here that news that Democrats feel that they have no power and the situation and their visceral reaction is coming from that place of of fear\nAnd frankly the frustration on the part of Democrats you know President Obama thought that he could get a lot of things done with Republicans in a good faith negotiating way and it just didn't happen\nThat was NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Kelsey Snell and medical ... thanks everyone thank you thank you\nAnd Dominican stick with us now it's time for racial ...\nShrinking fifty seven people of color or need your help we will never found out\n[noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all over the place this week we're looking at Minnesota's\nEighth congressional district diminished out you're still with us and I want to bring in mark the deck like Minnesota Public radio hey mark thanks for joining us it's my pleasure of a big fan of the show thanks for having me oh I thank you so mark what's it been like they're on the ground\nWell Minnesota's just a hot bed of political activity this year not just in the eighth district remembers sooner Al Franken he resigned in January\nHis seat needs to be filled in a special election a Minnesota senator image corporate shark is up for her regular reelection Minnesota's also choosing a new governor and three new members of Congress were really busy over here\nYou know the sixty eight competitive districts that the cook Political Report says either lean to one party or as a toss up only three of those are democratic held seats in Minnesota there are two of those seats and one of them is what we're talking about here today\nSo again we're looking at the eighth congressional district in Minnesota diminished go who is in this race\nWell this is an open seat that's because the Democrat Rick Nolan who's the congressman holds the seat is not running for reelection in Minnesota the Democratic party is referred to as the Democratic farmer labor party and that candidate\nIs Joel ridden a bitch he's a former state representative he's thirty two years old or the Republican candidate is Pete Stauber he's a St Louis county commissioner\nHe's a retired Duluth, Minnesota police officer and there's an independent in this race too so how he's going to shape this race is going to be interesting his name is ray sandman people call him skipped\nSo this is a district where in sort of an unusual thing for twenty Eighteen Republicans are on often right and if\nDemocrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to net to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if they want to have a real shock\nMarquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset if he has been in play Republicans every two years to have a run campaigns that have come close to winning\nVery optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points in the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest wing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd his the demographics tell a lot of that story told them they do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August ... had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play mining is a big\nIssue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the race if the Independence Party candidates you love support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat\nBoth read that ... been talking also a lot about taking back our government here's a Democrat ...\nWay to wrestle control from the special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people and rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race for dinner fetch like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare established says that's a bad idea here's ... going after stop her on the issue at that same debate\nMy opponent ... two minutes now to talk about health care and it's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage from war America\nThat caught up with ... in the southern end of the district north of the twin cities recently he's also trying to frame or done of it is a political opportunity someone who moved from Minneapolis back up north to get into the race\nI've got fifty two years of of life on this earth and I I've spent the vast majority of my life outside powers to my opponent has been in politics\nAnd entire life my\nHearing from voters you're out there\nWell people are engaged Democrats and Republicans both claimed that they have the most voter enthusiasm behind them as the election draws near\nA Democrats are saying some people who voted for Donald Trump have buyer's remorse and they're looking now to try to cast a vote against Trump\nIn the mid term elections in support people like a ... Republicans oh say they're equally fired up and they're saying as we've been hearing a lot all week\nThat's a battle over Brett Kavanaugh has really really fired up their base and they think that that is going to be\nEnough at least in northern Minnesota to flip by district from democratic and Republican control well I'm Mark thank you for joining us absolutely my pleasure thanks for having me and

every week through the mid term elections breaking down the major themes we're seeing this\nHuge your friends your your family your neighbors your co workers did out both Republicans\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot but if history is a guide most Americans won't vote in the midterms even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't bought a new species has actually that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home but also connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's to medical mountain RO and off Mulholland hey guys\nHey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well that's right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nAh that's been seen between the number of eligible Latino voters versus the number of Latino voters who've cast a ballot over the years\nSo what would happen if all these non voters showed up on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November\nWell first of all they might not be able to vote because you have to be registered before the deadline so people need to go look that up if you're if you're considering it\nAnd many of those deadlines with his hat either way or passed right but if that were to happen hey or\nPolls would probably be a lot more accurate because we have a better sense an ability to to map out by demographics how people would likely vote or it would certainly\nChanged the shape of not just the races in this country but I think ... has been making the point about public policy as well that was NPR's off for holidays and medical ... thanks so much guys the ones that are also [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and it feels like there are always stories that we just can't get too because there's so much other political news so every week we take a few minutes to dig in on some of those headlines that you may have missed and to do that\nWe always have Ron Elving however I tell her time\nSo let's start with spying the Justice Department unsealed charges this week against suspected Chinese spies for allegedly conducting espionage fill us in\nWe're not talking about the usual kinds of cloak and dagger military spying here this is about high tech competition between major economies so what does the U.S ...\nAllege the individual in question the Chinese individual posed as an official of a tech association but was in fact when official in Chinese intelligence and he invited a GE engineer to visit China stayed in touch tried to get specific proprietary information and so he was arrested in Brussels by Belgian authorities\nAnd has been extradited to the United states to face trial up but this could be a big deal because even though it's economic as we say it's the first time someone believed to be in Chinese intelligence has been brought to the United states to stand trial\nOK moving on the environmental protection agency has taken some new actions to weaken regulations is that right brought\nThis was the week with the United nations came out with that big report giving the world's governments essentially a decade to get serious about climate change before it's too late that got a certain amount of attention but not so much attention has gone to some of the individual things the EPA has been deciding having to do with various kinds of pollution and\nThis particular week of the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board for particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come out of gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs\nAnd this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals have weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and\nAh last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment right the last\nStory involved health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate vote in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty built not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months has a kind of\nAbsolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place Ron tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so\nInsurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars in patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the log they couldn't repeat\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other is happening\nThank you Ron thank you\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back\nAnd you're listening to
