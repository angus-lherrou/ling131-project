God well visiting the Saudi conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing\nHe did not criticized the Saudis and beer down ... was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious to Mr showed jihad died a in their custody he at the at the embassy and pushed and both\nThe pressure was asked about a world tour in an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in\nTrump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell it it took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress just see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly that President uses those numbers off and the dollar amount is exaggerated according to ... as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia or ... out\nBy all of this is interesting or give given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like a not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the ace his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in on hinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you Scott [noise]\nWhile President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of cars show jeeze death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to Riyadh for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly analyst Dan ... of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nThe educational needs of our students are still taking a back seat to just the humanitarian aid that they have just a basic food shelter clothing water and just the basic ...\nYeah [noise] do you have anything resembling a timeline as to when you may reopen the schools\nWe hope maybe mid November if you saw the devastation that is really an aggressive on light because so many of our schools don't have power or running water or electricity or any of those Internet service or any of those things you normally see\nUh out of school we do want to make sure all of our seniors graduate on time and that most of our students are able to promote the next grade level so to be able to do that way to start as soon as we can for sure\nMr most how do you handle the fact that I'm I'm sure a lot of students are are in families who have lost their homes and and they're staying with relatives or had to move to other places in to the districts must be all mixed up by now\nIt really isn't for most of our communities we have basically thirty six schools about twenty six thousand students in our school district and there are several cities within our county and\nWithin each of those cities the school is often times the hub of that community especially for a lot of our students that school the only with the top of that community but that want safe place that they could rely on because oftentimes the life of our kids\nAs pretty rough and so we're trying the best we can to rebuild those communities through rebuilding our schools as fast as we can but for a lot of our students it'll take years to get them back to where they were before the hurricane hit\nDo you have any schools that escaped damage or or or at least having been hurt so badly that you you can't use them\nWe have between six to twelve of that argues well here's the dilemma we're coming up with the schools that are severely damaged we can't use because they don't have power electricity bill schools that were damaged or not being used as shelters for the time being and and maybe for the CEO of a future\nMr moss I gather that despite or maybe even because of the considerable losses if you've had and challenges you have um there's still going to be a football game Saturday Night\n[laughter] yes there will Scott and I have a feeling there'll be a lot of folks there that are sports fans but they're coming there just because it's a way for our community to come together through of all things a football game\nOh that sounds nice do you have a cheer you can share with is\nWhat the team that's playing out mostly dolphins yeah of all thing and so the ban will be there playing the fights all the cheerleaders will be there and we're trying to\nHave it look as much as a regular football game would be a even though we understand that a lot of athletes that will be flying are living in shelters and do not have to return to after the game but a lot of our student athletes their extended family is their tea\nAnd so it'd be a way for them to reconnect with their teammates and their extended family on the football field\nI don't get a vote but go dolphins\n[laughter] with the absolutely Scott\nSteve moss is vice chairman of Florida's bay county school board thanks so much for being with us they got a\n\nThis is NPR News\n\nI'm thirty nine you're listening to double ...

I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that\nThis is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series in Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want it up to this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and it would be a weight exactly yes and a Christian taller debuted as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course is already in assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when I make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive league the NBA he's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with\nMy colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point\nBut in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter] you know and in in that sport it's a big deal in in professional sports and move a male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's going to be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rule change to go to the uh what what what are they going to do it it's the a ... break yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve and they're going to go to a tie break the way to the way they do after the U.S open after after the ... I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree\nTheir stand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe a Howard thank you you're in San Francisco good they're commemorate and fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "20"}
