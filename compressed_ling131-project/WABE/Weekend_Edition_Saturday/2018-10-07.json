ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kevin ... and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try\nTo get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nOh hi how are you a great thanks so how has changed since humans intervened in this process well\nListen since about ten thousand years ago and the origin of agriculture human beings have been messing around with the ... plant what you're looking at is\nNatural varieties which ... which are tasteless which have no smell and uh the farmers were like we can do better than this and they started cross breeding almost from the get go\nI didn't think this is going to go so immediately to the sex life of plants that apparently that's where we're headed um I mean why though has modern fruit become as sugary as it has\nWell one of the main dates remember here is Nineteen thirty which is one of the United states play a passes the plant patent act\nAnd from that point forward the idea is we're trying to\nEncourage farmers to actually manipulate those plants and to make them sweeter and to make them fat or a and also to make them see list to take their sex away in fact what's happening is is that when you when you actually take the sex drive of a plant away when you take away it feeds\nIt actually could puts more energy into getting fat and sweet\nWhen you read about how fruit um has impacted the zoo animals were you surprised\n[noise] uh no not not at all I mean as I say for years now we've been lobbying\nThese natural varieties of almost everything about them except their sweetness you you look at a watermelon there is no seed was watermelon dish the full of just bright red luscious fruit there's nothing like that found in nature the tomatoes you find in nature are tiny and it tastes lists\nThe apples you find in nature or almost all of them are better as people don't realize that everything that we're seeing in the in the supermarket they're like super stars there like supermodels and and it leaves athletes like LeBron James that's what we're looking at the supermarket\nTo let me ask you because eating the super model of the of the free world doesn't sound like necessarily a bad thing I'm you've written a book about this kind of stuff that the farmhouse food stopping food on is free part of the problem has it become less nutritious is it just good looking unless good for us\nI I think that the argument among the dieticians is is that is the yes the higher sugar content is robbing\nA food of a a lot of it's a nutritional value and I also think there's a tradition in America of somehow seeking perfection through our food that somehow if we equal white we will make ourselves mentally and spiritually\nBetter and so of course if we see row after row perfectly glistening absolutely gorgeous completely look like Apple's we think yeah I Want that\n... but ... is still good for humans\nOf course eat like your grandmother told you to

it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up after that he took some questions and a reporter asked him\nWhat message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that women\nI think that's sort of\nI feel we're in many ways\nA lot of women that are certainly a tremendous number\nThat's an echo of something that he said at a rally last week at in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that that turn that\nRally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points it costs the Republican spectrum tickets to the

records\nOnly half of the request forms gave patients the option of requesting their entire medical record hospitals didn't necessarily offer digital reports as required in this study found record

and and Christine Blasey Ford said that she was reluctant to come forward because she was worried it wouldn't matter in the end\nAnd now Brett Kavanaugh still goes to the Supreme Court anyway so what does that do what does that do for for women all across the country who saw Argo through that who maybe had a similar experience in her life\nAnd and have a scene this is the combination of a year long national conversation about how we take our Jason seriously or not\nI don't think that it ends here at all I don't think that it can and I think some people who supported Kavanaugh account and have kind of ... colon seem to argue he'll get on the court and everyone will kind of come together and everything will be better and I just\nI don't think that we see any evidence of that I think that the divisions in this country seem to be real and seemed to be hardening not\nYou know I I don't see him getting confirmed in all of these people who have been so passionate who've been protesting who've been talking about uh the sexual assaults that they've been through I don't see that just fading away it seems like it would make people even more passionate\nIf we're talking about the energy that might come off of this event you can already feel it immediately after Joe Manchin a announced Hughes support for Brett Kavanaugh went outside in was confronted by a number of demonstrators who shouted him down as he tried to explain it [noise]\nAnd I\nAnd I\nWent out so Kelsey you and I cover Congress this is just been such a weird process I mean it started off thinking wow this is going to be this ethic clash over the key swing vote then it became over the summer it seems like kind of a dud in terms of political interest in a done deal\nAnd then we spent the last month watching this visceral personal fight play out on national television and radio I mean what do you think you're going to take away from all this\nI Am going to be really watching the way senators recover from this if they recover from this\nBecause it's very likely that they're going to leave town fairly shortly here to go finished campaigning for the midterms which is the only let's gosh just a little bit more than a month away and once they leave they're going to go back into an even more partisan environment where they're running for reelection or supporting other people running for reelection\nAnd then they have to come back here and keep the government open and have a fight about President Trump's demand for a wall on the border with Mexico\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly and are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or does this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nAnd and for me it it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust them the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court is just as partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak thanks everybody\nThanks glad to be here thanks\nThis is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the we [noise]\nWe\nGet these people of color\nWe will never know\nThe way the [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where it's Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing an end Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats telling me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying gas wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nMe the Betty honest with you at risk up in the beginning that his governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe shows me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome but can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote isn't Florida\nYet still um you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and so some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that is really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that but other races are having an impact on the Senate\nRace absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy\nIs and what's killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line right and and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident ever probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a

kinds of investigations into them men cannot require or demand investigations into women\nEven that we're talking a lot about the enthusiasm that we're seeing among men head of the midterms\nI I think we have to sort of put that in perspective which is that the enthusiasm we are seeing among women it's somewhat unprecedented I mean I have not sort of heard or seen this level of enthusiasm for women and women are telling me you know they have\nNever done anything beyond vote before and in an election and now they're knocking on doors they're canvassing they're protesting they're going to march it's I mean there's an extreme level of engagement among women and so even though we're talking about what's happening\nI'm On the other side of the spectrum\nI think that it's it's not happening in a vacuum right it's also happening in contract and maybe you could argue because up some of the enthusiasm we're seeing\nFrom within and when we're talking about women here we're talking about democratic women and I mean that's\nAn interesting point because there are a lot of Republican women frankly who are leading the charge on saying that they feel like their husbands or their sons are somehow being treated unfairly\nThis time and twenty sixteen we were talking about will you see this big shift of women voters to Hillary Clinton in response to President Trump's various scandals and statements and the answer was a pretty resounding no\nAnd it's true now too when we look at the polling that has not moved Republican woman at all ...\nThey may go midterms are based elections typically and until recently one base was really super energize now both ... seem to be really super energize I guess one question is is this going to be\nA super ... on steroids base election and and the other question is does this fate is this like a boom of enthusiasm that you know if Republicans are the victors in this fight then maybe they fade out\nYou know look to us from his point about the fact that women are fired up women have been fired up this entire time right I mean since President Trump was elected women have been fired up and their levels were already polling very high so what this issue was able to do is\nEven though democratic enthusiasm ... picked up slightly since the summer it had a lot more room to grow for Republicans and Republicans have really struggled to find a single issue that would fire up the base and\nThis one seems to have done so and they were kind of surprised by that it does look like that at least the bet that Republicans are making is that this will be a base election because when you look at the enthusiasm numbers for Latinos for young people for independence groups that right now are leaning toward Democrats and are key core constituency democratic groups for this election\nThose are much lower and if that's the case then we are headed for kind of a train crash of a of a culture war in at the ballot box in November of base election\nSo we're about a month to election day right\nIt's a very short amount of time but in the modern\nNews cycle that we live in a month is an eternity like five years with Kevin ... on his way to the Supreme Court do we think that that that may be Republican voters aren't so riled up because they got their guided gotten two Supreme Court justice said that's a reason why a lot of Republicans voted for Donald Trump to begin with\nAnd they kind of fade away again or do we think this has staying power\nMe if you're talking about psychology um the motion of anger and fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember the things that you're happy about the things that you are bitter about\nThat said we just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and it's\nThis big moment [laughter] of energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of bigger python and anger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott\nDetrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got\nSome of the things we're gonna talk about would have been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start\nWith this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nAuthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not giving you a bigger seat and neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also to band so phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like fencing all there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses a just a couple of years ago and\nTo prevent the introduction offend would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see a same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations or go to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that\nPossible so is there a plan for for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt right\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR Nike Ron thank you
