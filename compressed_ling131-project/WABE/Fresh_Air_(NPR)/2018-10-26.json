there was a massive manhunt underway for this individual that involve federal and local authorities across multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from the Justice

great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nA reader or ... or else want to start with you know how suspects are in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this and has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and I bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nThere's always going to be a lot of forensic evidence when you're involved when you're working on this many um bomb devices the other thing that we see it in cases like this um if there's any um video coverage of where the person may have dropped these packages off\nUm sometimes you know the person gets caught him but it we've seen that in recent a bomb or bother tax\nWhat I'm getting some feedback on myself so it's a little bit a little bit to us\nFrom any sorry we'll see if we can do something about that or Mr hunter I Wonder if you when you would think about whether or not this man was acting alone what else he said look around his home what other clues do you look for to try and find out if he was acting alone or if they're on these with him\nYeah the ... so the first thing you can do is when you get a search warrant you can get into his apartment or his house you're going to secure all of the computer or evidence so what kind of email records are there what kind of computer records soon as he who is associated with avian talking what you're able to check sell ...\nAnything like that then you can start interviewing a neighbors friends associates someone they know something someone may have heard something someone may have seen something and then the real question is how much did they do and what are they\nInvolved so all of those things are happening right now probably simultaneously and there's a probably a decent chance that someone did do something in in a case like this\nOne kind of I'm Sorry oh what kind of clues from the packages themselves will investigators be looking for\n[noise] well I'm a couple of things I mean you you you want to see the kind of component that we're using this sort of a device so that might lead\nI'm a investigators to the location for these things were purchased and so for example if you find out where these kids are just you might have additional surveillance a video\nAnd perhaps this person was accompanied by someone when they went and purchased parts\nThat's a that's a ... a one example and then when you send all the arts off to the lab wanted jokes FBI will likely do that again you may get additional for him which\nFinger credits any sort of DNA those kinds of things could all be uncovered from these many many devices so there's really I'm a huge sort a source of evidence that has to be called\nThrough by investigators\nOnce again we're waiting for attorney general Jeff Sessions and a whole slate\nOf law enforcement officials from ATF from U.S Postal inspection service to speak at the Justice Department about the arrest today I'm fifty six year old man in Florida\nIn the in the mail bombings that have taken place over the past week I Wonder when you listen to them yourself a we're speaking with William hunt former FBI special agent I Wonder what you were going to be listening for in particular what what uh keys do you think there will be to this a news conference\nWell I I mean I think there are a couple of things so so the first thing that I think I'm\nAt a press ... going to want to hear is is are there any other outstanding threat I mean there there could be other devices that we should we certainly hope there there's not ... to make sure that everything is safe so that's the that the first thing [noise] um the other thing is I mean everyone's got to be wondering about a load of it I don't know that we're going to um have\nThat information yet because it's an ongoing acted investigation but that's the big um um\nPiece of the puzzle here that people are are obviously on a ... to find out ... and ... will have to see whether we get any clues about um that sort of say\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight\nOr what your thoughts on the fact that these devices never exploded not one of them does it is it assigned to you that this suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell um [noise] you know this is this is ... I'm completely uncommon ... and one thing that you see what this kind of thing it's just sort of jumped to sort of terrorize people [noise] um even if you have someone who's not capable of\nOf actually creating a a an an active device it's going to explode or this is obviously a away to terrorize people are just sort of get back at the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's um probably the uh the the\nBig I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang hang with us if you can ah NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who it is a that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a lineup we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill ah we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so\nThis is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time fades at the Justice Department\nHas her unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's tire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he wasn't dress sector package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear there\nEven if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything as for motive it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... Crump South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address sees a V. suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand no authority the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he issue a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California\nHe says we're thankful every one we work with\nIs safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity a during this very a dark period where many prominent Democrats have and that that ah recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far the the people who've gotten these packages up and critics of the president I'm Kerry if you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days of course on some of the targets\nA or intended recipients of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder the former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nAnd another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet without have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string ah for the\nVast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the images that you've seen\nJustice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University of Virginia a loo country they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "26"}
