immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful so actually let's get back up a second they haven't even begun to prepares for the census I mean the the the real problem with the census is that it's way behind schedule when it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off\nIs another question in there and starting this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latinos from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn\nOf late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the data that the government collects is researchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example\nUm we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country if\nThe data on prescription drugs and not been made available and not been possible if we don't have a picture of what the society it looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo that people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states in big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you um\nAre you a U.S citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census and the states and cities fear their political representation will be calculated\nIncorrectly because they will be misrepresented in a sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering so\nWilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound ages here but I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep and meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who tried to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who are brought in to try to explain how the department work to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment an additive add\n... became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the ... rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice she was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book

A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's for sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was a versus the biggest\nPart of no ... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institutions within the Commerce Department a and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical\nAnd er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather uh that sounds actually like a good that he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who runs no or as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... just a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or\nIf that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it\nIt has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a you're terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was the law they had to do it they didn't have any choice\nTrump pay no attention didn't take it seriously with irritated when every heard money was being spent but no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win\nSo Jared Kushner although we oversaw kinda closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fifth risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nSupport for W.

Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth the risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAfter President Trump\nWas inaugurated he sent in what you described as a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people and the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running department or jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpreted as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos\n... who are studying the way people judge risk is that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one and a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking lots of you know wanting to million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought the society doesn't feel it caught him and he showed you that people don't really feel this and that insight as what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street lay back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm swing what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question what is the question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat them by the national as\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nIn every business there's that on one of unbelievable success but who knows if you could ever replicated I think it's a combination of the name the price point the ability to see it on line\n... make a blind fencing is right there with generous but the new players happen exactly left the old ones behind\nFenty is owned by European conglomerate Elvie mh which is also behind yes so far and highly gender is moving into brick and mortar her products will soon be for sale adults in New York American ... summer\nAnd this final notes reports of the death of Toys R us may have been exaggerated the bankrupt retailer has canceled an auction of its brand name and other assets instead to hedge funds that now control the company plan to revive the toys R Us and babies are us brands\nIn court papers filed Monday Toys R us says it will form a new branding company to maintain existing license agreements\nAnd develop new retail businesses under the iconic name it's been just a year since those same hedge funds decided to liquidate the company closing eight hundred stores and leaving some thirty three thousand workers without jobs\nAlso no longer up for auction Jeffrey the giraffe the toys R Us mascot\n[noise]\n\nMarketplaces supported by foreign X. dot com committed to empowering and helping traders seize opportunities in currency markets since Nineteen Ninety nine foreigners come it's your World Trade it for extracting involve significant risk of loss\nCan buy Drexel University Drexel University is academic model prepares the generic leaders to address the challenges of a changing world more intellectual dot edu slash ambition camp waved\nAnti legal zoom offering a network of independent attorneys who can provide the advice your business needs more legal zoom dot com slash marketplace\nAll right we got to go the Dow Jones industrial average climbed one hundred twenty two points for tents presents the NASDAQ fell thirty seven points nearly half a percent and the U.S in the five\nHundred last one point pretty much unchanged our digital team includes Sarah Mendez Tony Wagner and Joanne Griffith than half code is our digital visual producer Sarah movie is the executive director of digital ... is our executive director of on demand and I made me Scott in for the result will be tomorrow [noise]\n\nThis is a pie and\nListening to Ninety point one WABC Atlanta where each ... each NPR support for WNBA comes from Kimberly Clark corporation homo ... more information about Kimberly Clark and it's one hundred and forty six year history of innovation is available on the Web Kimberly diverge\nDot com China wants to build a new city from scratch on\nFor the project I saw is that about fitness pollock mark on MORNING EDITION from NPR News waking up Atlanta from six cents a Ninety played one W.

explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department work to have\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment additive add\n... became very curious is that the exposure is finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the forms rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less him but he you know he is an odd choice he was very odd choice because with that department really ... if someone who's really comfortable with technology [noise]\nWell if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to

on MORNING EDITION from NPR News waking up at Lana from six defense on Ninety point one\nW. A. B. E. this is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government\nUnder Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem\nI mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most there is this enterprise that is\nNot a trivial prize the society it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done where physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about innocence through ask the Commerce Department clears the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. A. Noah and ... you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department\nIs an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs no uh as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of it\nThe weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nI think that's what happened and that coupled with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if she had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a you'd been terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a ... Chris Christie that got him fired\n[noise] I think what happened was this that\nThey allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do it they didn't have any choice Trump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being spent but no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win\nSo Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely and made sure the Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it was he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the ... this risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the ... looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're gonna take a break and we'll be right back this is fresh air [noise]\nReally this is fresh air on Ninety ... won W eighty [noise]\n\nWABC begin serving Atlanta Seventy years ago in the early days we sounded like this [noise]\nSorry new nine hours a day five days a week from that point one make a cycle spot on your frequently\nAlong the way he was on the air at Ninety point one of them end on the world Wide Web uh WABC ... and we grew into what you know and love today\nThis is city lighting sound doubled you Amy this is\nW. ab serving Atlanta since Nineteen forty eight\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart can search for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment options learned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from tire rats\nOffering a tire decision guy to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions with a network of more than seven thousand independent installers direct dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been best sellers his new book the fifth the risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nAfter President Trump\nWas inaugurated he sent in what you described as a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was ... met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listened politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fun basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting an ... 'cause there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leach is [noise]\nTony him into the Columbia River and poisons the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of intimacy showed you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm swing what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well a method that question [laughter] what is it a question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalized and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits they're exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould a figure triggered by the national", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "02"}
