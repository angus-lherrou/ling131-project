{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "Did you talk to other doctors who had who are also involved in the organization to get more feedback or did you just know I'm going to do this\nI didn't have a great deal of council 'cause there's not a lot of folks who do this yeah there wasn't somebody I can call and say you know I'm thinking about it so I jumped in and I became a donor first because I wanted to do something\nAnd there was a little tab that said you know click here if you may join us in fact I just was looking I was just looking in a couple of hours later um I was halfway through the application process and houses and I I don't know\nI don't know I didn't know but then a few months later there was a opening in Sudan there was nobody who could go and that that\nThat spoke to me I hadn't done orientation hadn't been HR none of that stuff\nAnd they said we know you haven't done any of those things are you willing to go and I'm a Texan has been a day that was friday and I left on Thursday what year was a two thousand eleven on baby girl as a year and some change old I had breast milk in the freezer [noise]\nUm but it felt like the right thing to the idea that there was nobody spoke to me\nYou go to Sudan and then and then what do you see when you arrive\nOh there was so many things that were unfamiliar I had never been anywhere I\nHad and I never been across the Atlantic ocean we didn't go camping I didn't know any of that stuff I mean I\nI was I was lost in terms of the culture and the and the life of in this kind of work [laughter] um but\nWhat is true across the world is as soon as I get to that place where the patients are I Know exactly where I Am because you're a doctor yet I can I can I Do no matter where you go [laughter]\nYou know big bellies and and wailing in the distance that that's where I feel comfortable that's my that's where I live alone and then your second tour I that that's a that's not the word you know [laughter] but your your second\nYeah so the second time I'm the first time was you know special 'cause it's per se but it was also because Sudan and South Sudan were scheduled to succeed so they were I was there for a new country being born and I felt connected to the people there and and the [noise]\nThe other staff that were there I felt like I I could come back and help out if they needed me but I hadn't you know so the bucket list thing ... to go\nUp orders but it spoke to me it felt the opposite of the questions I had at home like am I supposed to be here is this worth ... this week I had in store for me and all of that was gone and I'll say oh this is exactly where I'm supposed to be exactly what I'm supposed to be doing\nThen as I mentioned coming into the segment you know often you all are in in areas where there is conflict or there's been conflict arguing midst of the conflict very much obviously extreme poverty in you know sometimes politics gets in a way how did you maneuver through all that or you just focus on what you do as a doctor\nThat the political arena is is part of why I joined Doctors Without borders because it's a level playing field it doesn't matter whose team you're on who started it who broke the ceasefire all of that is irrelevant and I think it makes it easier to do what I Do and the next patient needs me and this is what I Do and it doesn't matter\nWhere they came from or what uniform there where\nHere in this country you are used to having everything that you need in terms of physician your fellow being OBGYN you'd have everything that you need all the instruments from the table to everything but when you're halfway around the globe do they make sure you have as best as possible everything that you need and I'm sure that that can be challenging to\nI Am a particular surgeon my mother was a scrub nurse so I I Know what I like and and I don't I don't make any bones about making that clear but each and every time that I needed something special or injure kid or specialize it was available and I I appreciate that as\nYou know I'm On the board and I'm I'm I'm part of Doctors Without borders in a global fashion that I you know not just the search insist really making sure that we're doing right by people across the world and that is where I Begin I feel like if I go into the or and what I Need is air than we are doing this thing right\nAnd you you've completed for surge golden I'm\nFive now yeah five ... who was the last ... last one was South Sudan itself so um this new country has you know needs of its own and and things have changed since I was first there but the patients don't change their mommies worried about their babies that never changes never change from that to go\nWith this new interactive exhibit in\nTour we hope people will get out and you're also considered a guy so take me through what what are you doing here\nThe idea is [noise] I Would say it's a chance for us to tell those stories that won't be hurt otherwise part of Doctors Without borders is this idea in French it's called ... guys who are fringe organization and they were different in that\nYou can't just come home and go back to your regular life there's a there's an obligation as a as an impetus to tell stories\nInfringe it means to bear witness to testify really so this is our version of that this is when people say if you see something that's not right to say something and this is an amalgamation of all of our stories like we come back and when we're together\nWe share these stories that are painful and an extraordinary [noise]\nWe want it to be able to share that with people who who don't aren't as close to the refugee crisis they don't know anybody who's going through this but we say you don't you don't know people who are refugees but you remember house fires back in the seventies and eighties\nWe got our close together my mom made us find pictures with that person kid in it because they wouldn't have any they were lost and the fire all of those networks are very similar except that they're gone in a civil war that people don't have their neighbors and\nFriends to rely on they don't have a way to get to the hospital when they're very very ill so that part of it is\nThat's the part that universal that you that you see it looks different in another language it sounds different\nAnd the images that we might see in news reports of what we might hear on NPR BBC is one thing\nBut this interactive exhibits ... it takes to visit or\nThe person through all of this through your lives yeah and you all are telling the story\nRight so we start with the patients that need ... where where can we be somewhere that they can get to us so we talk about the logistics of\nWhereas here where can we get clean water well how can we get medicines that have to be under you know Seventy degrees Fahrenheit at all times how do we make sure that the vaccines could hit on time that we have bandages and suture and all of those things so the exhibit is a great way\nTo see this crisis through our eyes the things that are familiar to us the setting up the breaking down to finding the patients and and in so doing we get a chance to tell their story\nIt's selfish to ask how do you all\nBalance how do you all cold\nBecause you're seeing some extra listen we see extreme poverty here in this country but you all are also seen extreme poverty on another level with a whole lot of one of the issues tied to it how do you balance that\nWe have each other I think and and that comes across when you're at the exhibit you realize it\nAt any time I could raise my voice and three people will turn to see what I mean because we are used to being a team and in the field there's no\nNobody is at all concerned about my academic credentials sometimes what they needed somebody who can run to the blended fast yeah and that part of it is is is where you also find your your nurturing and you're carrying because people people know how hard it is I\nTalked to sort of you you and I guess I imagine that maybe you've had to deal with last too\n[noise] yeah\nThat's the thing that comes with being an obstetrician when it's good it's good oh man there's nothing like stealing that first kids from a newborn there's nothing like it when it's bad if it's a it's equally awful\nI met my first maternal death was in Sudan and it had never happened had been around ... you know ... in the hospital I knew a lady who you know what I mean but not\nIn my arms in my hand and I didn't know what to do I didn't know what to do it I had never happened that don't speak the language\nAnd culturally speaking almost entirely unprepared for and how it goes so that part I mean it's hard but we have each other this exhibit is uh the Georgia wrote Congress center yes the west plaza part yeah right outside of buildings see\nWhat do you want people to know about this exhibited and\nEncourage him to take it's free it's free so y'all y'all liked it what do you want people to know about this\nUm this is this is a chance for\n\nAtlanta and to see what is missing in the talk ... ... what's on television and in papers is different than looking a person in their face who is terrified about losing their baby\nAnd that never changes but they have no hospital nearby so I've I've had patients that have thought were\n... you know in labor bleeding leading leading and but because she was sitting crisscross applesauce it was her feet that were bleeding she had walked to the hospital that far pregnant with her other little baby with her and I'm like man I\nKnow how hard I can fight for my children I Know I Will but seeing someone who's who's only goal is to get to the hospital and I\nI'm always amazed and I always and encouraged by motherhood because this is this is the same everywhere [noise]\nTalked to Africa Stuart thank you for each do thank you for your work and in Atlanta based OBGYN insurgent who was competed for surgical sign as an African she's with Doctors Without borders that interactive exhibits ... thank you so much for coming in and I think to appreciate it [noise]\nForgetful show everybody likes the\nSenate if he's going to abolish the national park system\n[laughter] that's so great my middle ground which turned out it is ... ... what do you think listening back to ... I it's strange\nTo hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I also rattling I always wanted\nTo know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that the Senate life folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them [noise]\nNo my no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that in a million years um my friend can sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh\nHe called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know it was just coming can I can I send that you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely um special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man but that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it and like you know Fifteen minutes but\nIt was just thought to I think I get the feel I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold the mirror up and see if anyone realized just how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal\nShooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nWe have sale end to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it was kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rig so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird there were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you could I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of press against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nGet a bit of ... in ... city lie beyond this we'll rent so and I think a quartet violin is Jessica ... who\nWill join us head to their upcoming performance the world's most celebrated venue the concern about\nI'm Lois bright Foose joy\nEight pm on double your ab ...\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene\nWhen the right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dresses yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive down that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene and part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of it oh okay no no\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled at it and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to terminated for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen they said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible in wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults [laughter] insulting\nOh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter]\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said\nIt was an animal and then if I didn't cheat on a leash than he would hit him\nWith his car did you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know what I said was that\nWe need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine let me get a relay what these do not balls to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIs productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone you're just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just got back on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise] and then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm gonna go this direction [laughter]\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\n[noise] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible or was it stand up New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and I know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver metallic\nKind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so he gets hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh it's really fun this is really strange and fun and such a title\nBacked of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous than more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as of character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that we do always dress the way you describe a\n... yeah I was completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge way to some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kitty but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends ... who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and go do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're Glenn may swing caper some kind of scuba suits thing and it just seemed so fun it was all so much more\nRidiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\nSupport for WABC

I. A.\nDot org [noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex as one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is any woman ever been like\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know\nFour and a half minutes and the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shut them now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stop talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler\nGod I don't think it was my favorite I think the more at work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching saying times oh my God so\nI Know there's the light oh aerial ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man\nI Would have flashes like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know how to keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off the finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was

[laughter] what do you think listening back to ... I it's strange to hear\nBack I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I Do rattling I always wanted to know\nWhose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that just having a lot of folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to\nThem [noise] no my no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that than a million years um [noise] my friend Ken sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now than I\nYou know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he called and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't you in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come and can I can I send that you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and that really lovely a special effects guy there just said oh yeah those are going to be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man but it really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it and like you know Fifteen minutes but\nI just thought ah I think I got to feel I started to think may maybe it's time to kind of hold hold a mirror up and see if anyone realizes how kind of ridiculous they're being\nSo one of the things that you became famous for within that sketches the moving podium which you kind of Dr aggressively [laughter] reporters and then there was like one a one sketch we actually drove it down was the Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nWe were all over Manhattan in that podium which was very surreal shooting it I I think I pitched it at one point of you know do we go\nThrough kind of ceiling to the to the sunset and I think I just actually thought it would be fun to drive kind of a Segway podium around Manhattan I didn't think they would ever let me do it all is said why is that what it was on\nWell it's kind of based on that some you know these incredible people built this whole rigs so it was kind of a podium sitting on a a Segway type of contraption but they've built they built this whole thing and and rigged it but\nAnd it was weird they were just\nYou know all up and down the streets there were all these people watching and then you can I'd look up into the building and just see you know hundreds of people kind of ... against the glass and I thought this is the most surreal moment I'll probably ever have\nIf you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she's now starring in the new movie can you ever forgive me so we'll be right back after a break this is fresh air\nSupport for WABC comes from theater Emory presenting the elaborate entrance of ... we're proud to present and the more skin rotating repertory from October twenty third through November eleventh him to marry gray Monroe theater arts stopped him re dot edu\nWith fewer than three weeks until the mid term repealing Obamacare is a major issue in a New Jersey restaurant in a good coffee incumbent has the tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News from the filter on my viewpoint won W it'd be\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is\nA memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nWhen the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink and your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do grow sat comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of a a okay and none of none of us felt\nThat way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone Brazil data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to term it for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because we're things like this do happen\nAnd I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the earth swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found it liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so you're ... really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults [laughter]\nInsulting oh no [laughter] not in real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter]\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't cheat on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say or even when I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language I mean I get a relay what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone you just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner you corner me I won't you drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes\nOn and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and stuff\nYou know I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I got it all out on on screen but [noise]\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction [laughter] do you remember any of the material you did that first night [noise] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible or\nWas it stand up New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and I know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver metallic\nKind of trench coat dress and\nAnd I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so he gets hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they were harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself\nAnd then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this relief on this is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his miss why I I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and I would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that we do always dress the way you described a\n... yeah I was completely completely ... in a different I was always in a huge way to some very elaborate costume 'em but\nOh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and go do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like\nYou know we we're glad may swing caper some kind of scuba suit thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us my guess is Melissa McCarthy and she stars in a new movie called can you ever forgive me we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\nSupport for uh WABC comes from the Atlanta symphony orchestra Donald run uncles returns to

interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your\nTop off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and\nEspecially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so there is that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nAbout are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that\nRoad like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who even though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching ... times oh my God so\nI Know there's the light oh ... ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man I Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a on my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they left he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I now that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional
