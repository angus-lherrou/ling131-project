executive producer of the double CD the Beatles on air live at the BBC volume two he's also an executive producer of the re mastered first fine\nThe CDs include performances of originals and cover as as well as interviews with the Beatles how it had to search for these recordings because the b._b._c. didn't keep master tapes of the broadcast how\nIt also wrote a book called the Beatles the b._b._c. archives that includes transcription of their BBC Radio and TV interviews as well as BBC internal production memos about the Beatles\nKnew you were talking a little earlier about um how the Beatles what also taught ex temper rainiest ... on the BBC even though a lot of the shows were scripted on the BBC and some of the interview sounds scripted [laughter] and some of them don't this one doesn't I Want to play something from volume one of\nThe Beatles live at the BBC and this is um an interview track with it presented name Bryan Matthew\nAnd does track is titled riding on the bus 'cause it's one of the things that are asked about well it's one of the things actually I think that Paul mentioned [laughter] about the kind of thing you can't do anymore when you're famous uh cause some of his interviews about what it's been like for them to be famous do you want to say a few words about it\n[noise] well yes us food career progressed and they became internationally successful [noise]\nThe nature of the interviews changed or they didn't do so many programs on the BBC it was just how to crime in to the ... costs for the BBC but they remain loyal to such a big club which was presented by brown Matthew\nAnd he was very much respected by the Beatles they grew up listening to him and his very important program started a club and he tried to\nAsk some serious questions and and that was a serious question to which he received a quite serious require I think I mean you do get the first indications of being trapped in this bubble of fame or when you listen to it you know ah [noise]\nThey miss riding on a bus um well pulled us joined us from above ... says [noise] but ah you do get the feeling now that are having made it so big that there are drawbacks to this\nAnd and Brian tries to explore this theme in the interview\nSo this is the Beatles ah from volume one of the Beatles live at the BBC in in short intervene\nBefore we have another song feathers or a few things I'd like to ask you know first of all do you ever get tired of being bagels\nThose those are the loneliness who now I don't think so really don't know just in case you know you get teased off with the\nPeople rising rubbish about you what you get off and I gave it a lot of divorce and all of a dozen kids\nNow what do you [laughter] well I mean doesn't that isn't as a big big sort of drag 'em down you have to go around expanding to walk you know there's almost\nNo she knows and I'll do this because I have seen every day [laughter]\nIs important but what about the simplest things of lifelike like riding on the bus yeah old guy to just about any restaurant you well yeah you miss those sorts of things and we go to ... other people other social ... will be the title pretend they don't know so we have the time I was ... and they don't know\nYet ... will come into you know it is\nThat's family beetles live at the BBC volume one and my guess Kevin how it uh for ... two of the Beatles live at the BBC and he also has a new book called the Beatles the b._b._c. archives Nineteen sixty teen teen Nineteen Seventy [noise] um\nWhat is some of the things you learned about the Beatles from listening to the interviews that you were able to uncover in your research ...\nWell the interviews really good for your back into time I I think this whole thing it's like traveling back to experience the full story as it happened when you're so used to them now being the group of old time\nYou have to a pinch yourself and go back to a time when nobody knew that was going to be the case so in those early interviews that of transcribed in the book\nThat continuing layoffs what are you going to do when this is all over because you know ... groups didn't have a long shelf life uh\nThere was an interview in the book when they're interviewed because they're going to appear on the road variety performance which is a great\nActor late in show business in the u._k. in those days\nAnd a piece of woods the interviewer is asking them you know that age old question what are you going to do when this is all over how long do you think you're lost and a judge says well if we do as well as close in the shadows of done we will be moaning Richard in the shadows I'd lost it at this point in the u._k. about five years which was just seemed\nJust seemed a lifetime to everybody\nAnd ah this question just keeps cropping up all the way through the career up to Nineteen Seventy nobody had any idea how fast they would progress and how every record they made would be a signal from the front to other groups this is what you have to catch up to there was so progressive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17"}
