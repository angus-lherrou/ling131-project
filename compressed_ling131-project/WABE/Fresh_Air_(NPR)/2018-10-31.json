more for the [laughter]\nAs you got a\nGotten a little older so I got a little comfortable\nWith sandals certain word but it's not just cousin just because the cusp where it got to be a joke or a part of the joke so\nDo you need to do stand up to keep you entrenched in that just in that who you are because you wouldn't you'd known is Ricky smiley the comedian but you got so much other stuff going on do you have to stand up to kind of keep you you do stand up where people over ...\nYou don't give up you don't you don't you don't stop dance or ... to the party\nYou oughta maintenance because when you stop doing stand up then TV ONE owns you and then radio one owns you stand up comedy keep you as an independent contractor\nBecause as you and nobody owns it is yours but when you give up stand up on a national level in order to do a radio or TV being your own by the network so even\nIf I lose everything I always ask that I can always get ... at the improv or the funding buy and sell out everywhere I go\nBecause I'm a professional stand up comedian so that's how you keep your independence or whatever and people have more respect for you when they know that you're not dependent on them to know what I mean yeah\nBut you know Rick you also within there is a a group there is that that that black comedian group and everyone is sort of a part of this just keep it real and then lately we've had some other comedians you know come in after other comedians and ... what do you make of that\nDisappointing because when we started we didn't do that you know comedians had beep and

dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford the allegations of sexual assault and whether those justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess I can offer two thoughts one leaving aside the specifics\nOf Dr for its testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices can stand seeing the court placed a in the mail room\nThey they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court they live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justice is no\nKavanaugh chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not they live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants there are other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean at Harvard law school tire cabinet to uh come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they light cabinet and they respect him there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerk for justice is Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and who who of course was Obama's pick\nTo succeed Scully in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who have been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues\nAnd it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself or herself at a lower court you can always\nSubstitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects\nA leaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true partisan shelf\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving said all that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas [noise]\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was ... it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ... I think it helps to uh in the Bible Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and front insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and teach Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration\nIs involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was\nA ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system which\nLots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything at that point other than tweet so I think\nBy and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessor leap proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court rules against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms\nOf and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time once they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice that you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with of course such nomination and you said some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course ... nomination why was he ... to lacked that\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that gutted the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... and future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to this day in court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the ring writes active Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous Zimmer arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five um you can like or\nDislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices but Congress passed a law\nAnd re ... the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic preference\nWhy is it um that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their alleged writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts is a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable\nAct and you write that he had to draft of his decision what were the differences between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nAnd we knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted to strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the ... being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because there were four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions looked like and sometimes as justices will say Robertson otherwise the opinion just doesn't\nRight and he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in\nA close case decided I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter\nTo strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\n[noise] if you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the

Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or attacks journalist I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is of course that you are having a an originalist or a texture list or\nDo they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot\nThere is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me based on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nLet's say you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favor as a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because of the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their Stella credentials those were unnecessary requirement forgetting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right weight\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes tightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees ... includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAnd and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nRent control rules are rare in the U.S just Fifteen California cities have them along with some jurisdictions in New Jersey Maryland New York and then also the seat in Massachusetts they ended their rent control that's Vanessa Carter us the researcher who co authored a recent report into the effects of rent regulations\nEconomic theory suggests that there will be units taken off the market folks would stop building that it would create a market distortion but the research on the actual impacts of rent stabilization don't show that\nCarter's research found that rent control tend not to affects new construction the local rules she studied exempted new buildings from rent limits Carter did find that rent regulations helps people stay in their homes\nWhen we look at housing

the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself at his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford the allegations of sexual ...\nSouth and let it us justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess I can offer two thoughts one leaving aside the specifics\nOf Dr Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices can stand seeing the court placed or in the mail room\nThey they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court they live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justices know\nHaving a chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not they live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants is there other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean at Harvard law school tired cabin up to ah come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they like Kavanaugh and they respect him there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerked for justice is Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and who who of course was Obama's pick\nTo succeed Scully in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues\nAnd it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very uh biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr hurt herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh in bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true partisan shelf\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance appeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it you know are are there Republican interest or their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact bias\nThe appearance of by a bias is a real one having settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige I think it helps to uh in feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is because they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise]\nAre you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore come to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in the case\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was or not the ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything at that point other than tweet so I think\nBy and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court rules against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remain friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear [noise]\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice that you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives\nCalled Kavanaugh\nApprove Eric ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that got at the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... and future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to the Supreme Court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the ring writes active Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous or arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nUm you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices but Congress passed the law\nAnd re upped the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role to override that democratic preference\nWhy is it um that those who brought\nThe challenge against the voting rights act somehow you need to have their ledge writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts is a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that he had to draft of his decision what what's the difference is between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though a initially voted to strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks\nTo draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the AC eighty four to ... Iraq being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because there were four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions looked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't\nRight and he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best sense of the word in a ...\nCase decided I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter\nTo strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the Constitution's he's also the former legal affairs editor of Newsweek we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this fresh air\n[noise] weird [noise] yet right now I'm ... years back with doctors all through or something in the next city lie [noise]\nReally look at the cultural phenomenon of Mary Elise Frankenstein Victor Frankenstein\n... deadbeat dad writing generate is being an immediate checks\nOut back in time lowest Rice's joined us as a PS ...

joining us I guess it's David Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh wasn't originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or attacks journalist I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch or having a an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they would both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot\nThere is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nWas something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favors a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions Laurel are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things with such general terms\nNecessarily or inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators I'm to use their own judgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their stellar credentials those were necessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees ... includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "31"}
