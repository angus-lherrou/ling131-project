uh the\nUltimate goal had to do with what was published in an appeal for human rights and I had to do with the jobs and education and housing and voting and the same things we are working with now we've we're working with the same issues are the very same issues\nYou know I I asked Mr keen to to reflect on\nJust often we hear about when we talk about civil rights movement and we know about\nThe march across the bridge we know about the I have a dream speech we know about so many other\nI guess acts for social justice and I asked him to reflect on the Atlanta student movement because for some a lot of people just have to use the word overlooked but maybe it doesn't get talked about enough used when he said\nHow do you view the Atlanta student\nMovement and its role\nIts place I Know we don't we probably should rank\nWhich movement did this and which movement did that and\nHelped the people the most but from your retrospect ...\nServes as a result ... favorite\nSo since I was\nAs or

understand how the system works and I think that it was very\nIt was very good but I think we did learn how to make it happen\nA summer at the natural aspects of it\nI mean we we had a I must have been about Fifteen to twenty\nYoungsters who\nPretty much gave up their education and all the major disaster I can tell you how bad it was\nAnd then you need to\nMultiply that by ten [noise]\nUsed to do when I start with you what is your place in the civil rights movement even concern yourself with that you've heard what used to king had to say [noise]\nActually I don't I'm a\nTo me it was a

deep inside of me that was the same\nAll over and different people and we never discussed it that we got this thing called segregation and we got to do something about it and no matter where we were we were we were we all had that same problem\nHe talked to ... your this place in history but the Atlanta too well\nIn terms of overcoming segregation and Jim Crow I think it was a tremendous breakthrough\nI think the fact that waste some under the courage and not only some under the coverage but also a at the same time conventions fix college presidents who didn't want us to do any of this that way\nMake a statement we would let let her know what we were protesting and we would\nMove forward with their permission and they gave it based on the fact that we were able to outline for
