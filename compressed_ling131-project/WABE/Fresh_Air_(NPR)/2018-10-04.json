latest piece in the New Yorker we'll talk about how data breaches and the Russian disinformation campaign and twenty six team like Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg under scrutiny as the mid term elections approaching\nThe tools by which Facebook is held accountable or not the tools that we use in politics it's not like you vote the bums out this is a case in which a private company is making profound choices about the contours and the boundaries of political expression and we don't have obvious tools with which to regulate\nMove here about how Facebook became vulnerable to spreading disinformation has ... is attempting to combat fake news and the inherent problems in monitoring political content without violating\nUsers free speech\nFirst news\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ... here on Capitol Hill lawmakers will continue to circulate all day through a secure room beneath the capital where they are being briefed on a new FBI report on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Here's NPR's Tim Mak\nRepublicans who have been briefed on the report said that there was no evidence corroborating sexual assault allegations against the judge here's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham a staunch Kavanaugh defender\nWithout learn nothing I already know and I'm Glad the FBI is what they did\nTheir report is completed\nA key procedural vote is expected to take place tomorrow and that will likely determine the fate of Kavanaugh's nomination\nFor all the stronger\nIn terms of understanding the facts and I look for and I am ready to vote\nAll eyes will be an undecided Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake Tim Mak NPR News Washington\nEven as a Republican lawmakers are saying the FBI report shows no evidence of sexual misconduct or excessive drinking on the part of Kavanaugh others knew the nominee in college or earlier have counted that narrative tried Lincoln as a Kavanaugh friend from Gail who apparently was not interviewed by the FBI and its latest probe and spoke with NPR's all things considered today the\nBasically I was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think Britain ... confused that was passing out but the black new phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nRetired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has come out against the cabinet nominations today speaking event in Florida Steven citing what he said his Kavanaugh's potential political bias citing his Senate testimony\nSenate Republicans say the FBI report finds no evidence for the sexual assault allegations against the nominate but the lawyer for one accuser says that as no surprise from member station W E s a in Pittsburgh ...\nPotter is more like lava nod he represents truly sweat neck she says that she attended parties in the Nineteen eighties where she observed Kavanaugh drunk and pressing himself against women without their consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined usa data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing it response of\nYes exactly as he said you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going with all of their resources we're going to grow he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was safe\n[laughter] what are some of the of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they begin to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like\nA auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember in the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um\nWe're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out how to you tweak people's vanities and their passions and their susceptibility and their desires in order to keep them on the site the most important thing Facebook could do\nAnd this is how they measured it was made sure that people were\n... were signing on and staying on whenever you joined the company in your orientation you were taught about something very important in a metric known as el six or seven\nWhich means the number of people who logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement and eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns\nThe ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign on one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat a Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth and Facebook\nHave an ... is a staff writer for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break this is fresh air\nSupport for WABC comes from Leslie hind Dimon auctioneers a global fine art

with MORNING EDITION from NPR News on Ninety point one W. A. B.\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer Evan ... he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook has done a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors and give us an example\n[noise] this is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who was Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he'd become a conscientious objector to social media a said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth and vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong that our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executives come\nAnd talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects to the company's growth was a real wakeup call externally and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is an impeachable and the company has been done to acknowledge it hurt for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glaze dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore you\nKnow you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he has an and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we are doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world I'm\nVery often what he came to believe was that they would criticize them at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing and that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had a civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook but that was simply a sign that they were being\nBold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people said that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states it's and it's really imbedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively transparent in order 'em\nTo be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves but that put the\nOdds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed that being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their\nTheir ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nRight and and it had gotten the special exemption 'em to permit ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so this was it was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding you know that point at the end where they say who who paid for the ad\nThey said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're a new technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new innovation but as a result that meant that it was in a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics\nWhere in many cases of mysterious orange and it was very hard to know who was posting them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed Facebook employee with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to help the campaigns use the platform effectively how did they respond [noise]\nFor the Clinton campaign or rejected the offer 'em\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embraced it eagerly they were a much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates [noise]\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped them craft their messages they help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background color or changing the tax or the font how that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate\nSo later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa ... said to an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role\nIn the process how did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up [noise]\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress turnout among constituencies that they expected to be important to the Democrats including African Americans and young liberals and and white women and\nBite bite targeting that population using these incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their success and they've talked\nAbout it ever since I have an ... is a staff writer for the

Facebook ghost in the machine is in a recent issue of the magazine [noise]\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency and Russia um how did soccer bird respond to this [noise]\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in [noise]\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismiss it they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ... million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation\nAnd what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's why I'm to the company was in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nThere was a lot riding on that appearance I you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and he in some way\nIs vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or an ... senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads that it was such an obvious fact to anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same as everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye Korea or you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this\n[noise] it's become this consuming effort a Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaking one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads now we are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than TV does we're going to\nLet users be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "04"}
