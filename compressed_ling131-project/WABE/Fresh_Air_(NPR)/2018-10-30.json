films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nHad heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition and um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out

literal sibling abuse troubling and fascinating\nAnd why skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits whether inflicted from someone else would themself\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that in self punishing about that\nAnd there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you\nWhere are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate very briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm I'm going to be stars aren't have stars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general\nRecklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that Comey is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now\nLanded a kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of\nBeing so excited and exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in after the break\nThis is fresh air\nWith midterm elections around the corner keeping up with the headlines this political season can seem\nLike Democrats need twenty three seats on ... to take back control of Congress a teacher has to do the Kentucky state house majority leader Republican all things considered gives you the\nContext and analysis in news you need without all the noise here the bigger picture every afternoon from four to six thirty on Ninety point one W. A. B. E.\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly\nAh let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone because of nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn no excuse me she's Michael so\nOK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan no Homer see that would be but I Would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] like who is Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting\nThat you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess\nThe wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who ...\nTo think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so mean\nYou don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kid is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times change that was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you\nAwful [laughter] but it is it is not good to me then either I didn't like the idea that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I not that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity\nTo understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise] so um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I ... I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know\nThose people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] what do we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back this is fresh air\nThe next city line youngest an author mono goal of back talks about a theatrical peace based on her mother's journey\nThe ... year my grandfather was only able to procure one ticket and so the decision of whom they were going to choose was so excruciating and they chose my mother because they felt that the music would give her the strength to survive\nI'm lowest writes us joined us at eight PM mom W.
