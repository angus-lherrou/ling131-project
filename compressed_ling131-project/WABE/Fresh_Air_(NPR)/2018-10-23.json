suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this then the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act that did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport\nOr birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote this law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed and Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's a locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race and call box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turn out by ... percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally in twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called back due to plant that idea\nKobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a ... for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd ... had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university\nTestified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law called Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nChris called back has also been an advocate for a new question\nTo be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship argue a citizen [noise] um how does that apply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in\nThere was a review of\nEvery ballots cast between two thousand and twenty four canes over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there are only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think they're real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about\nEarly voting turn on his way up\nAnd a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this has alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that he wants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly at an early voting because\nHe feels like this is hurting the Republican Party and anytime it seems like Republicans are about to lose an election they invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud which they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation\nWell we've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election after we take a short break\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the balance the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a

rights and voting restrictions I guess as Ari Berman he's the author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones so he's been writing about voting issues\nHe said that twenty Eighteen can actually be a big year for expanding voting rights in spite of all these additional new restrictions\nThat we've been discussing and their initiatives on the ballot in seven states it would make it easier to vote and harder for states to gerrymander political districts so give us an overview of those uh initiatives on the seven states\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Terry twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiative that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration\nThere are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder non partisan redistricting and places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida\nWhere one point six million ex felons can't though that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida including one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy\nThat has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office and the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people\nScott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ... pounds in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as a Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights heat\nUp out of voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but cabin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the twenty Eighteen election right now\nLike chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\n[noise] it's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now would seem to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange days that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nHe says if he does keep farming

bill it can become technically legalize so that you could grow yet I think that's an exciting new potential market\nBut changing what you farm isn't something folks in North Carolina can do immediately tomboy he says some politicians understand that either the senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S trade negotiator\nWhat's hard about this current trading environment of course is that China is a big market for North Carolina farmers and this change has come suddenly for them\nAnd the effects of the trade war likely won't disappear as abruptly as

question and that was a question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that\nBasically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers\nSo they might have names that don't match on the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually enter the correct name incorrectly or because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize\nThe name and so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people of color are ending up on these pending registration lists\nAre there other ways that Brian Kemp as secretary of state has restricted voting rights\nYes so there was recently a very interesting report by the U.S commission on civil rights a very historic group that's been monitoring civil rights for for many years and they looked at the different ways\nIn which voting is being targeted and they found five different ways that voting is being targeted through voter ID laws through proof of citizenship lost to register by purging the voting rolls by\nCutting early voting and by closing polling places\nThey found that Georgia was the only state that has adopted all five of these voting restrictions\nSo it's not just one thing that Georgia is doing Georgia has closed two hundred and fourteen polling places in recent years they have cut back on early voting they have aggressively purge the voter rolls Georgia has purge almost ten percent of people\nFrom voting rolls one point five million people have been purged from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen so there's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot\n[noise] okay there's other states with voting issues to talk about but first we're going to take a short break if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for

A. B. E.\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nNot just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually\nDid anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally and the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but\nAnother part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in coal box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally\nIn the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me\nThat he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nCalled Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures its use to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk\nTo Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted\nThere was a review of\nEvery ballot cast between two thousand and twenty fourteen so over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think the real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about\nEarly voting turn on his way up in a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this was alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that he\nWants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly at an early voting because he feels like this is hurting the Republican Party in at any time it seems like Republicans are about to lose an election\nThey invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud which they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation [noise]\nWell we've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election after we take a short break\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones or he's been covering up all the voting issues and more that we've been talking about\nWe'll be right back after we take a short break this is fresh air\nI'm On your

talking about voting rights and voting restrictions I guess is\nBerman he's the author of give us the balance the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones so he's been writing about voting issues\nSee said that twenty Eighteen can actually be a big year for expanding voting rights in spite of all these additional new restrictions\nThat we've been discussing and their initiatives on the ballot in seven states it would make it easier to vote and harder for states to gerrymander political districts so give us an overview of those uh initiatives on the seven states\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Carey twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiatives that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration there are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymandered by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting\nIn places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida\nWhere they have a ballot initiative that would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can felt that the staggering number what that means is that\nOne in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state\nCan't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia and North Dakota and Kansas and other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts than\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons and Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as a Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he upheld a voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority\nOthers in that state but a cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law and he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to in ... words or promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive and his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld",
