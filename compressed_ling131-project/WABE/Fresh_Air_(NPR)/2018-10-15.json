very conservative men obviously I'm not a big are they were there for their own delights or or whatever but definitely didn't think they were going to be the guys that ended up on stage which they were\nIt was a lawyer on that was on the phone talking to his wife and three kids saying goodnight another guy just come back from overseas in Afghanistan this was a a little sport that he had a little job that I don't know if anybody knew about that he had and um\nAnd they were just very sort of conservative guy sitting there going drinking water one had a beer but that was it and next thing you know they're out on stage and uh it was very corny much more corny\nBut the women came in and that was one of the things that that was due to when we smack in the back and watched there was a birthday party there there was a a bachelorette party you could see that the women that were in there had had this night\nCircled on their counter for I don't know a month and they were going to go ... and no matter how it was the fun of it above them sort of bus in each other's jobs getting embarrassed acting more embarrassed so maybe they even were but they just had a ball and you know an hour

out what I meant if I was trying to give direction or saying let me do that um or at least not talk about me to show 'em and I like going over there and acting something out and then\nI'm actually when I went to Hollywood I had a production assistant job that I went out there for and I was interested in acting but I still wasn't able to shake hands with myself at that was really going to be a possible career and um\nSomebody like red didn't days confused and aging said I Want to meet you and sent me out on her read in the first read I ever had in Hollywood two weeks after that there\nWas a

to be a long horn egos God dog buddy I liked the sound of that and um I went to University of Texas and um she was I got to Austin\nAnd what that city was about and how it ... you know I fit into it and had fit with me as the\nFirst two years I've still thinking about going to law school but it's where I got at the time I got really creative and and decided you know what that's not for me and that's when I decided to get in the storytelling business and I didn't think it was can be acting I went to film school say behind the camera and the acting gig was something that\nThat is still too far fetched I've always said this is true the acting was never really even in the vernacular of my dreams so so how did you become an actor and I'm In film school I started\nWhen I Would be directing something or or the photographer or even the aide de\n... jumping on the other side of the camera and acting it out what I meant if I was trying to give direction or saying let me do that um or at least not talked about me to show 'em and I like going over there and acting something out and then\nI'm actually when I went to Hollywood I had a production assistant job that I went out there for and I was interested in acting but I still wasn't able to shake hands with myself that that was really going to be a possible career and um somebody\nLikely I didn't days confused an agent said I Want to meet you and sent me out on or read in the first street I ever had in Hollywood two weeks after that there\nWas with a calf stretching paint McCann and it was for a film called boys on the side which I ended up getting the part I'm and never had to take that production assistant job\n[laughter] so you had said dazed and confused seemed like an aberration to you Chris what you did you know the director Richard Link letter\nFriend you know I didn't I I met I met the cash and go to Don Philips on that film in a in a bar one night top of the highest Thursday night with my girlfriend at the time Tony stereos we went to that bar because I knew the bartender and you give me free drinks\nAnd he said he was in film school at me the other guy in a larger producer he's in prison to tell mama

be wracked with Israel come to this address tomorrow morning nine o'clock at this time it was already three am\nAnd I went down there six hours later and there was a script with a handwritten note on top of it and it had a this character that was what are some there was a had a few great great lines\nAnd some of them are famous you want to read the famous ones\nAh well the one that was like that fit me off and I was just like who is this guy is when they're out from the um the billiard billiards joined ladies walking by and order since checking them out and he was there at the character played by sausage and to his\nAshes you ... you know you better stop that and you can end up in jail was like no man that's what I like about those high school girls man I get older the day stay the same age\nAnd it's a it's a great it was ... that was the ... the piece for what are some that I was like\nThat's not a line that she is being let's just fall off and when I look back to that seat I
