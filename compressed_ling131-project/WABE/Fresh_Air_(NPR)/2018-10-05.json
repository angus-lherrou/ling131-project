some point and\nIt's hard sometimes to do it in our culture because I think people are ashamed of getting older it's in a shame definitely people don't hide their age the way they used to because it's point last saw anybody needs to do is go on Google so what [laughter] bother to hide it\nBut but still I think people are very often very self conscious about their age especially in professions where you're judged by your age and that covers a lot of professions but when you're judged visually by your age I mean I'm sure that's one of the reasons why so many people get cosmetic surgery\nYou know

I didn't imagine it would be a terror\nAnd I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do and I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I couldn't closed for position\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most basic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that [noise]\nSo that was a big shock and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried everything you can imagine had injections um MRIs I'm an MRI came back and said there was inflammation in my head\nSo I had my hip drained and the doctor also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear Scott\nTear what do you mean a chair how could I get a ... you know and I'm sure the tear it was there forever I just didn't know it and until it was discovered and or had gotten to a place that it was um needing to be fixed\nSo I contemplated surgery contemplated everything I could do to avoid surgery and ultimately about Mm eight months later I was on the operating table getting reconstructive surgery\nThe doctor didn't know to what degree the hip injury was when I went into the surgery and I'm a a one and a half hour or two hours surgery ended up being a four hour surgery\nAnd after the surgery I was a I couldn't wait bear for two months it was on crutches for two months and I was um [noise]\nVery often in a a machine that kept my uh the circulation going in my leg so that we could try to build new cartilage grown cartilage um\nSo I did the best I could do to rehabilitate myself and um we got back slowly and still had troubles and try to figure it out [noise] nine months later I got back on stage um [noise]\nAnd then performed ... more months and then I retired from the New York city ballet\nHow do you change your relationship to your body\nNeeds to be in pain and to not know if your body was going to work properly again your body as your source [noise]\nUh the source of your pride the source of your work the source of your identity as a dancer and it's also just like your home I mean we all live in our bodies that your body it was like a very special body\nDefinitely was my home it was my best friend [laughter] you know and we could talk we could fight\nAnd uh we always found way to make peace um throughout my career um\nYou know it started to tell me what to do and I stopped demanding from it\nSo I had to soften up and empathize with my body and have a little more compassion for it and be grateful for what it did give me which was a phenomenal thirty year career with arguably the best company in the world\n[noise] you know a lot of people think of LA as being um the ultimate in like femininity in like\nI think kind of femininity like really to to your approach it New York city ballet was ... some like more of an extreme sport I mean you got your body into shapes and NGOs and doing jumps in getting lifted in ways that truly seem to defy the laws of gravity and defies the laws of what the body\nIs physically capable of um would you describe a little for people who have not seen you dance some of the things that you did that what we're so a typical for you but not typical for others [noise]\nRight well I can take it back to when I was a kid um I was a very athletic child very energetic trial and that's why I started dancing is is it a little too much energy if my mom said let's get the middle one the middle child out of the house in the afternoon sticker somewhere where she can release energy so\nAnd in between each casting I Would go back into the hospital and spend a week and traction with the heads Halter on and leather straps holding my hips down towards the base of the bed and twelve pounds pulling on my head on his head Halter [noise]\nSo um it's an ... uncomfortable as that was it really helped me straighten out my back [noise] and then I Would go into this body cast for a month the time and my teacher said to me at the time living in Louisville, Kentucky she said you know you've done so well\nAnd I don't want you to lose your focus during the treatment right now so I Want you to come into the studio in your body cast and I want you to try to do whatever you can do we don't expect you
