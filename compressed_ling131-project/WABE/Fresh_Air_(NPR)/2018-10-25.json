they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nThe main recruiting grounds which I've also heard described as a hunting grounds\nIt's no longer high school basketball you know a high school game\nFeatures maybe one star the kid maybe six six and he's playing against a five ten kid\nSo what's the shoe companies created was the grassroots basketball circuit and that put all the best players against each other in these pressurized situations that's where the college coaches go to scout\nAnd the person who created this ... sometimes called the godfather of grassroots basketball and sunny was a brilliant salesman an a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized the two things one was to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realize that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town and scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you had these tournaments that occur uh in Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the more and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture forests\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're

it's known\nAnd it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a

E.\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so and a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball but you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in the industry and\nAmong journalists and many follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nI had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in ...\n... to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bride is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros\nSend him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another or get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that\nAdds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment but Tina is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanna Kentucky\nAt Louisville he also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville\nHe did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational on a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if it weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be\nNow he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville overstated and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him\n[noise] and she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the wrestling was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from ... office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the ... in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be\nPermissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involve Louisville\nOoh that was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n... and in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees of sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this in the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Geno has a pending case against\nThe University of

yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes

this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nBecause sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and under certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty

sunny was a brilliant salesman an a and a brilliant\nSort of hustler in his own way so he realized two things one was that to put all the best players together was going to create a better recruiting situation but he also realized that\nBig time college coaches really don't want to go to small town after small town that scout players they like to go to Las Vegas and stay in five star hotels or go to Chicago Orlando and stay in five star hotels and watch a bunch of the best players so sunny not only put the best players together\nBut he created a situation that's coaches loved\nRight so you had these tournaments that occur I'm In Chicago or Orlando or Las Vegas\nWhere the best players come in these prospects these kids their families take the more and we're talking about middle school kids and a lot of cases right\nAnd there are these people who are not agents but you might call them runners street agents who sort of specialize in building relationships you describe a tournament in Las Vegas I think in July you want to just kind of paint that picture for us\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they're being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last ten\nPatient of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation

A. B.\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\n[noise] so and a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's that that's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that\nThe college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in the industry and\nAmong journalists and many follow this world\nIs that\nMany of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep\nTheir hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut she had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you and NBA player\nBut of course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nSo Rick Pitino is that the coach was on the cover of the book um\nThe book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment but Pitino is a fascinating character um you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does it special\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanted Kentucky won at Louisville\nHe also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the\nMore key franchises in professional basketball in college basketball particularly at Louisville\nHe did something that's almost never done he won with out the best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks Hi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called lottery picks\nRick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational and a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court and its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the balls that came by\nBut he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is a a\nPredictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given his walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him [noise] and she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in\nCourt this incident\nA woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the restaurant was terribly embarrassing and I would say\nAfter that Pitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men [noise] the second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper\nAnd what struck the gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm\nNot very far from his office sponsored by a local escort and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and\nIn the in in the NC double lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was rude to be\nIn permissible benefits to amateur players and Louisville actually lost his two thousandth Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville\nMove it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\nAnd in a stripper gate case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Pitino has a pending case against\nThe University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college
