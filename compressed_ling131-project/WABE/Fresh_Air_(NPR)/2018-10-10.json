D screens so it's kind of ...\nBeing in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later you see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know that was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight still uh Ryan ... isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know ah [laughter] oh we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone\nTo someone so we had to say that what did we ain't getting ... from we we have to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know a soul sucking void now that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean\nA sort of you know ah this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really\nThemselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind\nFrom the feeling is right before the moon flight\nMasha put together a press state meant about the death of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping to land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a band of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGear and Heinz who plays ... is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um or that you can again but you can find a line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI I actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land that thing I wasn't going to be stopped and and uh you know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music wise if we could get in to Neal's mine space if we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would be fit to sing\nOkay let's hear some of that music and the moon landing music\nThat's landing music from just in her late to score\nFirst man and new movie that Neil Armstrong\nAnd his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\nThey're saying that your film has become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera from the moon\nIs it an excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative publication the Daily Caller\nAnd this is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown he was asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked do you think that people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think those are\nPretty much exclusively among the people who haven't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused I think uh uh obviously the wedding was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking up the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nOr we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes in the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess this game inches al he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nSupport for WABC comes

[noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapist in this incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous

D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not\nHaving to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then then the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by\nExtension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it\nLooks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up our question [laughter] ... not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone so we had to\nSay that what did we ain't getting ... from ... we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can ...\nSo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't then\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [noise]\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void now that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know ah this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state meant about the deaths of the men on the flight\nBecause they're planning for possible catastrophe mhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they don't masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and uh what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a given Heinz who plays ... movie holding his\nIs a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um or that you can again but you can find a line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nThe ah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio up between the capsule and kept calm or an ... control and what not um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you know listen to all of it on line and and uh\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going the way in that thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone it come too far at that point to turn around and and\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only\nTwo percent of the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know sort of felt like a music why should we could get into Neal's mine space that we can get into that sense of just relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music and this is ... music\nThat's landing music from just in her late to score\nFor ... and ... movie about Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming a freshman to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and whiplash\nThey're saying that your film is become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera from the moon\nAnd an excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to you\nThe conservative publication the Daily Caller and this is from September fourth\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown he was asked do you think that's upsetting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flags and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's asked do you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among people who had seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flack standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know showing\nThe the the physical sticking up the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely instead of choice not a political one to focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed

[noise] I Want to ask\nYou about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah and yeah so it's\nA ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about this\nIs that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it pre ... hockey and having that\nKind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nAny version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually seen the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks the music that are that Neal and so the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "10"}
