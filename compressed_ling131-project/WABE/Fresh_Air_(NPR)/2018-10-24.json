and mercy the full day notice brand will send him to a camp and his father Murray Wilson isn't really upsetting seen I mean\nGod only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that and that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's very upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in\nA way that approximate it [laughter] you know Brian loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're getting the singing and I had seen you actually playing of course\nYeah and that's seen that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just insane\nYou used to be in a band called moved and your guitarist and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably have formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of mercy [noise]\nListening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly bad sounds and smile I don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you had so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music he's still felt like a school boy about it you know um you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightning side of him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know [noise] um is just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening ... um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd we found that totally I ... yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you'd you know how to play those courts let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court not Brian or a guy named area and his and his band ... helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say\nLet me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and endless amount of piano and slowly you know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through piano through Bryan his his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voicing and that changes the entire sounded the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nUm so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss

know and and jump off of 'em and then suddenly bringing actors into which we're asking you questions were bringing subjects that you might not have even thought of\nAn emotion passes through them and it fills out something and suddenly you don't need that line that you thought was the\nEssence of the film or something I'm ... you know in fact there is a line that's cut\nFrom the film that I think is\nReally important which has worn the character named Moran Miller play by bill camp says to the kid Joe\nSometimes you have to do the wrong thing to prove that you're alive\nPulled me over when I read it um\nI couldn't wait to put it in the film\nAnd then the edit room we didn't need it\nInteresting because it it kind of says that when I probably shouldn't even Seamus say now\n[laughter] [noise] do you have a lot more anxiety as a director anything you do as an actor\nAnd it's such a different kind of anxiety tell me that in different [noise] well\nI just want a migraine and one is dumb I gave them and I think that for me acting is just a bit more lonely because you do so much of the work on your own and then you arrive\nKind of hopefully full so speaking and then you're what you're seeing partners in your director and but\nDirecting is I'm\nSo collaborative it's more like\nYou know playing in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of the you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean that arrogant latest mean that's the that's the job you're dumb\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used to that somebody is always asking you a question somebody or you have to make millions decisions that day\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Paul Dana we've probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he's directed his first film at an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the movie's called wildlife too will be back after a short break ...\nSupport for W.

films include there will be blood love and mercy Little Miss sunshine he's in a new Showtime series called escape at Dannemora\nAnd he directed his first feature film and it's called wildlife it's adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and us here you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they're discovering that there's oil there\nAnd um there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist and in in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another uh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWe were both here what\nAre you sure\nThe laws cages you\nJulie I'm going to be All right\n...\n\nWhat your shirt [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and ... and ...\nBut you have

bugs that much I Will never backslide whenever it was last with no\nLast but not in my ...\n[noise] [noise] but I'm much louder say it loud\nI\n\nMean did you do you accept Jesus Christ as your lord\nAnd savior\n\n\n\n[noise]\nGee the jewels [noise]\nWow [laughter] spoiled you know and Daniel Day Lewis in a scene from the two thousand seven film there will be blood\nActually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul Dana's character like slapping the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis a\nUs so getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up around here in in the film that that she and it's almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you were making it [noise]\nTo here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from London Marcy\nAnd I'm\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over at the end\nSo rough I Know but it's getting their wife or cause was [noise]\nShe likes me it'll get better that the vocal counterpoint tobacco track [noise] real soulful [noise]\nOr you don't want my advice for my lovely\nAnd just tell me what you think that she was so many [noise]\nUm I'm living on her own\n[laughter] we're still family\nFamilies don't fired her own father\nDon't want to start that argument again from arguing I say something you argue but don't say anything\nForget what\nForget what you don't like the song I never said that until\nI Would change the title\nThe country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five\nFifty before I\nDid you close your eyes like I asked you to tell me and I think if you close your eyes you can see place something's happening\nLike be blind but because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking about\nI closed my eyes didn't see a thing\n[noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with the right arrangements\nWith your eyes French horn on it and flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex Kesha\nFrankly if you really want to know I don't care for it\nTo wishy washy if you leave me why leave me\nLife will go on why go on living it's not like a Beach Boys on your brothers are going to have a love song it's a suicide note didn't you just say it could be something with the writer arrangement well I gave in another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my guess Latino and bill camp in a scene from love and mercy the full day notice Brenda Wilson and bill camp and his father Murray Wilson is a really upsetting seen I mean God\nIt was such a beautiful song and in fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's very upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way that approximate it [laughter] you know Brian loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I had seen you actually playing of course\nYou're not seeing that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just in the same\nYou used to be in a band called moved and your guitar is and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably have formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film love and mercy\nListening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly pet sounds and smile I don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you had so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music she still felt like a school boy about it you know you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by light inside him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to give give that I'm through your music to somebody else who is experiencing you know um it's just such a beautiful generosity and\nAnd gift and you're listening to the ... um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd recounted totally I get it yeah unseen their core change as in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named Marian isn't as bad um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd single doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say\nLet me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and and this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan his his left hand the bass notes\nIncredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um which you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sounded the cord and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time um so for him in the music cannot you know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and\nYou know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess as a ... day now who is now also director Paul day now his
