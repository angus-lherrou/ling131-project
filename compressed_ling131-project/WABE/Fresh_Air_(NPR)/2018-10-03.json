mind\nYeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah were you like the body and Catherine my and kept her on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was\nI think that that's fair a kind of um you know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a demented thing to do but then\nUnderstand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her\nI think for a lot of women when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent um what is that what is

donation is complicated IDF is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bed and say oh no why are you having sex right now\nTo have a baby 'cause there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise] it's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was\nNormalized in gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI shouldn't hang out with all the Hazaras have had such a great way where they can get drunk and ... and maybe I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out an unusual path to getting a child not

E.\nIs fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life\nStarting Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor kind of you name it [laughter] and adoption [noise] um\nSo it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications of trying to conceive [noise]\nUm she also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts with the Catherine on character\nOn her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip but to kind of sexy pose\nBut what's really happening is that she's waiting for her husband to inject her was whatever the hormone is that she's getting at that moment\nAnd it's a great shot to show how what\nShould be a very sexual process you know what I mean like yeah making love and then conceiving when you're having to go through fertility treatments it's it's like it's injections and pills and you know all this stuff that's like\nNot only not sexy but it also kind of is going to have an effect on your body 'cause you're you're ingesting all these hormone yes yeah um and I said can you talk about that shot can you talk about like framing it as something that looks like it's going to be really sexual erotic it's not [laughter] and there's also sounds\nSo before you ... you kind of come into the senior hearing Paul and Paul has an amazing kind of whisper voice and she sang screwed over and you're hearing brass and it sounds sort of like a your overhearing kind of a bedroom\nScene and then you arrive and then it's a shot of Katherine slower hunch\nUm you don't see any heads are you it's not attached it's kind of her lower body a laid out on the bad and then Paul arrives above her and pulls her underpants down a little bit to expose sort of her\nHunch and you see a wedding ring any lowers at and then he says are you ready and she says yeah and he's like okay here we go and he starts counting one two three and you think they're going to like try some neurotic act\nBecause there's all this preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the ... needle and an intra muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that as a medical situation\n[noise] and and to compare it to say pregnancy like instead of\nThe has been put in his hand or the partner are putting their hand on you know the president belly feeling their baby inside he's kinda like stabbing her with needles in her belly and her and her head and I'm a ... ... again it's just\nIt's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that\nProcess is just so so different yeah\nIt it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and the fertility clinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing a doctor you're seeing her legs on the ... through her point of view of yeah it was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter]\nYeah um yeah and I'm ... I actually um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility\nIndustry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix well\nThat leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies\nAnd her age and costs her and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs to her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in the novel\nOr on the cover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still solar trade for what\nIn college than than its ideology ally that I have a career in\nHis hand out just send them the bills for Iowa is an idea you\nCan play soccer or if I'm going to some for our ambivalent about having a kid [noise]\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog but before you jump changing the deadline is remember a ... start as soon as I finish the play a\nLot after I get the story published I finished the book he blaming me know enough about [noise] oh I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation [noise]\nLot of women have family here forty one I thought I could too [noise]\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem fault that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors ever talked about a lie in\nBed with her leg my old egg and we're in the middle of an IV at an oh what a surprise sperm it's like [noise] on a sabbatical [noise]\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not hey\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guest timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nMean blaming myself yeah you like the ... and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started to understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of the leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nTo pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other\nAnd then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her\nI think for a lot of women when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nI think it's traumatizing at first and then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about is it about\nGiving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent um what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of I don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or\nLike when people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt and justice is always a Talib size like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing in the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um\nEgg donation is complicated IDF is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and nobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bed and say oh no why are you having sex right now\nTo have a baby because there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise] it's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff realizing\nThat the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends\nBecause any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had to pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normalized and gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out\nI should and hang out with all the ... [laughter] that have had such a great way where they can get drunk in line bed and ... and I have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out an unusual path to getting a child not the you know\nOld fashioned way let's put it that way so I really found like that was a safe place to be like a and it gave me a lot of perspective\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Tom Ridge ink and she wrote and directed the new film private life which are as Paul Giamatti and Kathryn ... as a couple in their forties trying to conceive through various methods or adopt\nTo have a baby and that's about all the complications medical hormonal and emotional that happen as a result it\nOpens in theaters and will be\nFlex starting this Friday we'll be right back this is fresh air\nWABC begin serving Atlanta Seventy years ago in the early days we sounded like this\nSeptember thirteenth Nineteen forty eight of MIT WABC when I'm there for the first time in\nA long way you can do they view of this program are involved with Robert Hi this is NPR's MORNING EDITION\nAnd we grew into what you know and love today when it comes to the wild places it's not as this is double UAB serving Atlanta since Nineteen forty eight\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this special and from capital one\nCommitted to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere [noise] capital one what's in your wallet capital one in may\nAnd from progressive insurance offering its home quote explorer so shoppers can evaluate options in one place when buying home insurance custom quotes and rates are available online learn more at progressive dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess just hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life which is a comedy that also has a lot of drama to it about a couple of played by Paul Giamatti and Catherine hon who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various fertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict [noise]\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and sons of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of you if you joined films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise] he said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who was older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was only ... here yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well if you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character so you make\nFeature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is on\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing um in part because\nTo the dementia and part because he's just not you didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men\nNeed between you and between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well Parenthood during that time has majors so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we\nDid a lot of what what is your mother arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad\nAnd he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school\nAnd did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of began became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "03"}
