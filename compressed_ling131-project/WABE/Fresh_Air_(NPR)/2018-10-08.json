what I don't want to read this problems\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and that transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is struggling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but\nAs a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth and ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nI've always wanted to I Want to get on record as saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of it\nMen or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about reading poetry that I'm feels instructional or\nA has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing to this book in absorbing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels they're embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nBut since you've declined to read more pounds back and found that I'm going to say I'm not being ... in transit you know it's just\nIt's it's I I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly accorded me even though I could barely cardio June\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people in the recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it and which is just so strange\nBut um it's a sign of how I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um\nWas characterized by that by that description that he did ... been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied uh it was a seeker\nI wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself but would that ... deep in the conflict he wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't\nBut with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um and through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction he somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this shabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising

and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have the have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I've always wanted to I Want to get on record\nAs say what I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they are contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing through this book in absorbing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice well since you've declined to read more pounds by your father I'm going to say about being ... tankers are in transit you know it's just\nIt's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did\nSix of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely cardio tune\nHallelujah I think like two hundred people in the recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded at ... which is just so strange but um it just sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius west and fully knowledge when you\nKnow he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him and um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did they'd been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied or he was a seeker\nI wasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and that wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this shabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising in delicious you know this unexpected\nAbility to to fill you know twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the it was a company by commercial success and accolades and\nTo see him take his hat off you know and sank we jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life when I saw it\nProbably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what year it was it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and she sings a larger\nAnd he ended it with what struck me as a benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoy your solitude and I felt like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone enjoy your solitaire\nYou may be songs find you and your solitude yeah that's

goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear how you do you do meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless ground into the looking at its faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places [noise]\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older [noise] there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] and you grow older than you then you sort of see\nI remember um\nI remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain and we were sitting on the corner of Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nUm five six ... the don't remember so how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfection of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims and my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nYou know he's he always maintained a role\nUm in in our life despite my parents' separation so a caravan has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of
