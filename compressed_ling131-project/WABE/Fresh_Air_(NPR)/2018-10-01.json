resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter there's there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting it\n[noise] did you face consequences did you get troll do a lot as a result of having ... lie\nI mean the ... ... ... ... absolutely so troll to la attacked a lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the this administration at this really highly politically charged time where we're living through I'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places\nUm notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thank me and I mean that was ... that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter Brad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and assume version of American democracy\nWe'll be right back this is fresh air\nWABC began serving Atlanta Seventy years ago in the early days weeks\nSounded like this that's one of the voice of education that a lot of George W ab eat them your schools they said was\nThe only one way or an ... W Avi Muslims serving and again you know we grew into what you know and love\nToday from W ABC News in Atlanta I'm Jim Burress eighty three to thank you Atlanta\n[noise] this is double UAB serving Atlanta since Nineteen forty eight\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nAnd it kind of brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration\nSeries that have been reported by meller and other reporters at\nThe Washington Post you know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested in that you used the word lying\nWeren't lying when used in the same sentence as Trump is very controversial in the journalism world because line implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not you and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing ... is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have\nRun fascinating stories here at the post about a times earlier in his career when he would adopt\nPhony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there's a there is an ... here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin Nunes has the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nWell this is at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discussed sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow and not just raised\nA lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone rights of ... there was digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other\nMembers of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been\nYou know this and all and it's all a dead trail and I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nUh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia's trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of handcuffed\nNow ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refuse to go along they're sort of stock\nThey can't see a way past that it takes some months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose [noise]\nYou know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference and this was in late September [noise]\nUm was a letter to state election officials from off for leaders of Congress warning of an named ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mentioned of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets of stars they look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um so\nSo meanwhile John Brennan who is trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell are saying oh yeah if you say that public again say you're interfering in the election so Brennan recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um\nI don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it\nAnd then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like treason [noise] um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um the tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time um where political imperatives where loyalty to party\nOr party considerations seemed to overwhelm everything else including\nThe concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states what is more deserving of protection um and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we see numerous cases through this period in which um when\nSenior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them their impulse is to protect their party interests to try to protect the prospect of the Trump victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's it's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and they take a short break then we'll be right back this is fresh air\nAnd you wonder if you could make a difference you know something you could do that would have a positive effect [noise]\nWhat about something that benefits all W.
