would on his on his fairly come down to play baseball with me and so forth and then he went away to war and he he was killed in the battle of the bulge but when he died I was very close to him the way the family dealt with it was it just wasn't talked about\nIt just happened and you you didn't ask a lot of questions she just was what it was and so I think that was sort of built into family

nobody knew about it I mean that kinda stuff so so we had a close relationship but also\nI was a of a young mind just like all the other kids my age where you didn't want your parents are right you

of the interview after a break this is fresh air\nThis is not equally one W. A. B. E. Atlanta thank you for joining us for this conversation with that Terry Gross between Terry Gross and Robert Redford the actor\nI'm Dave Barry Swain joined today by the vice president of radio Christine Dempsey thank you for coming in thank you day well you know it's interesting listening to the interview there I expect to hear something about his past films and in a moment they are going to talk about\nButch Cassidy and Sundance Kid or how could you not you know talk about that film [noise] um but I you know when you're talking about this film all is lost I just didn't expect we would go much further we went then\nTo his childhood then into the grief that he felt with a loss in the family how his family covers laws and the one thing I Will say the consistent thing that we're getting from Terry Gross is she continues to do that she surprises us with our questions with her questions and we get answers that are revealing that's I think why\nWe love to listen to fresh air and that's why we're asking for your contribution make a donation of financial contribution to the station that money is used to help the for the cost of programs like fresh air which cost us tens of thousands of\nDollars a year you can make a difference right now it's six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety that six seven eight\nFive five three Ninety Ninety or W. A. B. E. dot org but that is just a drop in the bucket we actually spend much many many more dollars just getting all these all the programs from all of our vendors it's\nAh it's well over a million dollars that's what W. A. B. and then let me be clear we\nBeing WABC pay for the programs that you're listening to that town this crazy system works is we shall out millions of dollars to pay for programs like fresh air or MORNING EDITION or this American Life so you can hear them\nBut the expectation is that sure we'll pay that amount and you'll problem the expectation is that you'll help us with that bill so\nWe're asking for your support right now six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety W. A. B. E. dot org and this is unlike any other\n... you know the thing about this is a since you brought that up is the honor system is absolutely the honor system we're we're saying at in as gently as we can you know you can be [laughter]\nYou know a lot of New York I you know listeners decide you know the contribution that they want to make and it's based on the value that they feel out of a show like fresh or the consistency of what we get out of something like fresh or the guest that she brings on the things we learn about science and the environment and politics and nature\nJust just from fresh air so that's why we're asking for your contribution at six seven eight\nFive five three Ninety Ninety or W. A. B. E. dot org\nAh Atlanta or as a community you are responsible for a huge portion of his ... what is it now is eighty six percent eighty five eighty six percent of our funding comes from the community at large that individuals like yourself that's local businesses help us out to pay for this so if you think\nWell my ten dollars a month won't help what we're saying is it absolutely will and the best part is the amount that you give us up to you six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety or W. A. B. E. dot org\nSix seven eight five five three nine zero nine zero W. A. B. E. dot org ah this program is unique it exists on public radio because it's the only place that really could exist\nUh you wouldn't hear show like fresh air on a commercial radio station why because commercial radio stations have to play\nCommercials every five minutes or so to pay their bills\nThat's not how it works here we do it with your help and what your dollars by is the time for a long form interview like Terry Gross does so let us know that you value that and you'd like to support it by calling six seven eight five five three Ninety Ninety or going online to W.

I was already beginning to feel the\nThe urge to to do something to do something that would be a maybe more supporting more independent type films [noise]\nThe idea was that we would get some funding together and that we would buy up films that had been either poorly distributed like Billy ... birthday party or a dynamite chicken you know some of the documentaries because I always loved documentaries is always extremely\nPositive and supportive of documentaries and so whatever I could do to promote them even back then I think Seventy [noise] um we thought well what if we buy up documentaries that were either not distributed or poorly distributed and films that were the same put them into a package\nAnd with for the college market went right to the colleges and say okay we're bringing this to you\nAs you're listening to the show sometimes it's easier to make splurge on line that you can listen and then make your contribution at the same process or don't\nForget the Web address it is W.
