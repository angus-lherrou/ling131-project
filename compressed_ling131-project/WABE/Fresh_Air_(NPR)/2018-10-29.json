{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WABE", "content": "And that is also causing you know in addition to the media aspects of it um you know these unconscionable events that are happening throughout the world not just in the United states throughout the world\nFor for ... what's ... what's why responsibilities and in the news media do we you know there was this talk of well you all are always putting would said politician is saying you're always every ... every time Donald Trump tweets y'all report it every time Donald Trump does is your report it are we doing too much\n[noise] yeah I think that's a really good question I also agree with um the previous a gas this is not only a media story this is primarily political story and these killers could have had a mental illness could have access to guns that there shouldn't have there is this is true but we live in a\nA ... over the last couple of years in a political environment where previously all of these thoughts may have been present but these people didn't act now they act in an environment where previously and think about things I think about because they're hearing them from the highest perch from the office\nSo there was supposed to be any of the media is still really three political speech and the way it is not all rallies are equal if you have somebody inciting violence talking about slender reporters against the wall talking about lock her up talking about inviting people to hack\nTheir opponents servers this is no longer a political rally this is this is a hate speech and incitement to violence and I think the media should reported but couch it in that language and then I'll I'll\nStick with you for a second and we'll also would rule and I think you just answered that politicians can play I'm thinking back to in a ... then candidate Obama and McCain we're in a in a McCain was speaking and a woman who called that these things about Obama and and you know sort of became said no\nThat's not true imagine this look this looks like a hundred years ago we have moved so beyond the basic understanding of political opposition as political position as political competition politics is about competing but we no longer think about it that way we have changed\nUnderstanding of politics for the last couple of years to do for politics to be about domination\nWith all means necessary about hating your opponents as if they're no longer are human beings I mean I think we really have to understand it a solution to this crisis that we're in is a political one it's a crisis of leadership it's a crisis on understanding what this country was built about it\nTo some understanding what democracy is\nGoing to let them or you want to chime in and let me say something about the McCain situation liberal when he was talking with the lady when she said what she believes ... about rock among the very minute he told her your sources are incorrect what'd you believe is wrong her entire view watch her entire life\nUnfolding in that very moment we have to say to people what you believe is wrong this things that happened\nOver the last Seventy two hours and was a mental health people deal with mental issues every day they don't go out and they don't murder they don't kill even off their meds they don't destroy society so we can't keep run into it ... it might be able to have let's just stop looking for that\nAll of these people not only did they have a social media trail\nUm the description of the shooter the synagogue shooter was high they said Hi criminal they've had other acts and just like the caller Lou I'm guessing the phones that there's so much already there that went and checked and it also does go unchecked in the media okay if they've got\nA rap sheet a track record all of these things that didn't happen in the social media sites\nWhy wasn't that in the media why wasn't it before why was suppressed why is there a great suppression that goes on in our\nMedia and we find out oh the FBI noses ... these people they've been following them for years they've had incident after incident that they continue to be able to exist in our society and you got certain sectors of society that don't want to see these things punishment because of how it makes their community look\nSo they bring these people back into their community and these things continue to happen\nFor the burden we talk about the message and the messenger do you think people are making some distinction there between well this is my candidate so he or she must be right as opposed to really focusing on let me look at the message and then let me fact checked on my own or folks just paying attention to the messenger 'cause that's the cameras of their political party\nI mean it's absolutely the messenger or you know it's a people I call it willful ignorance a lot of people will forever and it's the unwillingness to do the ... the work the heavy lifting that we have to do\n'em in order to figure out what people are actually saying you know people are able to I was which looking at political ad today and I will say well it was but they were clearly I mean it was\nAbout four lives back to back and I made that deduction because I turned around and went to the ... the candidates website and I read the Web site that was produced by the candidate and all of it uh that was in that ad was challenged based on what that candidate put out\nUm and so I think that people have to think for themselves as stopped following um you know these folks who are just\nReally run by power they want power they want to um wield the power over other individuals and they really don't care about you they don't care about you are getting arrested ultimately they're not coming to get you out of jail like you think that they are\nUm and then you know as the previous guest said from the Southern Poverty Law Center you know the folks and as the social media experts is that people just re brand themselves and they start all over again\nUm but we can track what they have been doing and what they've been saying um and so I think that we have to definitely address this whole idea of people just not doing the work like you have to think for yourselves\nProfessor how much power is airing them in in in the narrative and and political speech professionally and how much power isn't there\nIt's unlimited and I think what we have seen over the last Seventy two hours is what happens when you have the strongest people in the country used political narrative and political language to incite violence\nAs we wrap up will ... Pittsburgh will the events of the tree of life Senegal we'll let\nSpur any action to change any of this and your lawn and gab fly understand now gab is already found a new hosting provider mhm you know from that platform\nThing I ... in one of the tips you played earlier that um it was mentioned sixteen Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen twenty Nineteen or twenty Nineteen next year is something we're watching very closely in when we track storms we track all this we're looking at what um the\nJanette from an experiment that happened um years ago to the year two thousand caught we live in public twenty Nineteen is going to be a critical time for that\nEverybody having an audience everybody having a ... ah some of the things that we're going to see a Nineteen Seventy to twenty twenty that's fifty years since Vietnam Kent State and you talk about what today sounds like it sounds like that time\nAnd so we got to look and see what we do then I like the one of your shows earlier went back to Mr Rogers and said if you want to find the hope uh look for the helpers we need to turn the lens on their helpers right now\nProfessor burden book Pittsburgh change anything I Wish I could be as helpful as you'll into 'em but I cannot know we are we live in a country whose foundation is based on racism or sexism then a phobia the oppression of many groups of people\nUh and so we deal with that and we started actually doing something about it it's always going to continue this is not new it's not you know people were like oh my God how did this happen in America have you looked at this country over the last two hundred years like have we really looked at what we do what who we are\nIt's going to happen again and it's going to continue to happen and so we make some very specific changes and I like uh you land is I'm suggesting that is a good a suggestion but until we start doing the hard work of looking at and accepting who we really are as a country as our national identity\nIt is still and rife with violets\nAnd the perpetuation of it no nothing is going to change ... what do you think\nI absolutely agree with professor Britain and I also think what's really important to call things as they are which is why I started by saying that I don't always think that everything has two sides oh well you wouldn't be the first\nOne [laughter] only the social media person I have to hope that you still think connected over to your land here\nIn single burden you land allow to march ... thank you all for being part of this program I really appreciate it thank you very much [noise]\nAnd that's it for today's program closer look is produced by Candace Wheeler ...

or slash closer look and of course listen to a close look weak nights at nine PM stay tuned in any point one WB Atlantis choice for NPR I'm Rose Scott [noise]\n\nSo the synagogue shooting rubber ... criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist he's globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish\nYes the global is is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and I was worried that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often that the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global is with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because\nThey they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and\nThey believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized him for being too accommodating of Jewish influence and I'm Wondering here\nIs it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national that's been on the other hand you son in law Jared is Jewish\nA daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get a sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but it's the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration and white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement um\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform the towers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about\nGap is pretty small and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users um but uh it really embraces this\nSort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people I'm gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab you know I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and that was when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages\nHe was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue I'm\nIn storefront is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so\nWhat are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storefronts um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our ... and a choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's heartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating a phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement to then have somebody\nGo into a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nEliza ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Garrett black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n\nAfternoon this is fresh air on Monday point one W. A. B. lens choice for in the [noise]\nCity live we have two very different take on here in\nThe fall through the ages the west Side Story in the Atlanta Shakespeare come to me the luggage scale as\nAs rights is going to be a mom W ...\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we mounting those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from Garret blackouts\nThe subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning like people are better than white\nNational not nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race is like yeah but in particular I ever earned white nationalism is it that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance and by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away or things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue because I haven't read it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride then or\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs sort of subtly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races\nOther ways that white white nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would\nOrganize little teams that are apparently on line it's ... that would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points uh we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride would talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\n[noise] I find really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that\nImmigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people make these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language and finds you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and they are and fat in the in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting in the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and you're racist nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how to we're going to define who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time and there's no biological\nWine because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually wide by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick

now are said he's not a nationalist he's a global is its global is the buzz word for Jewish\nYes the global is is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and I was worried that the president himself and and many people close to him have used often that the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global is with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world\nWhy because they believe the Jews have worked their way into ...\nHuge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because\nThey they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this\nIs sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power they say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here is it's confusing to white nationalists to feeling the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a nationalist bent on the other hand\nHis son in law Jared is Jewish\nUh ... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get the sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nI think that they are a little bit confused but if the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration am white nationalist were widely condemned over the last fifty years by every politician or with any power in the country and and and now they feel like they have a politician who sort of is doing this dance of\nEmpowering some of their ideas speaking about some of their ideas but doing it with with enough room to provide himself distance from the real racism and history of bloodshed that's at the heart of the movement and\nSo I think white nationalist they do not believe that Donald Trump is a white nationalist at they don't think that he exactly identifies with their ideology but they think that he agrees with a lot of their ideas and that he's breathing real power into a lot of those ideas in a mainstream political space\nAnd in that context they're happy to be confused\nThe social media platform that Bowers used is called gab and it sounds like it's the alternative social media platform for people who are basically thrown off of Twitter or Facebook because of their racist anti Semitic statements so what can you tell us about gap\nThat gap is\nSmall and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have these ideas\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and Bowers when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In storefront is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nAre some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade\nAnd and the reaction is mostly that\nWell it's probably isn't quite the way to go about it he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter and stuff\nBut are are over with and uh Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's heartbroken and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels small waves Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism plays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popularize the movement to then somebody\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ... I think it's it's ...\n... is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air [noise]\nIs ... ... one W.

shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nGoing to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha slow who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included ... the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing\nEverybody and that that's the that wasn't what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nThirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and weren't prejudiced than people of color or then Jews which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away a things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect at with with a lot of voters and and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has it gotten other politicians elected in our country is well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue 'cause I haven't read it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they stormed front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride than\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts that were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they would go into the parking lot and they would hand out these CDs sort of suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was rebranded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races there are other ways that white\nWhite nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out of the rhetoric so can you talk about that on that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line it's wads\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and would talk about white pride talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and tried to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was\nJoining because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism a white supremacy\nAnd yet Garrett you were describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against due\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they do they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalists when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even
