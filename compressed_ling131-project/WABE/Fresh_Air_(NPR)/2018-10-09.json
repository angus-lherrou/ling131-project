uprisings ... the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring at the time a lot of people talk about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone the\nTrouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then\nAuthoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media and a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking and what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use is a journalist and turkey who retweet something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands of Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say\nTo what you buy can all be monitored and has brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness so for example if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent\nIf you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a\nFree charges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd I what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could have imagined\nIs the network side effect your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence of for example there are certain um places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the apps that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by\nThe year twenty twenty well the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ...\nAnd a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was

broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm [noise] this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nTwo things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and mapped out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them essentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals remaking battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out\nSmartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message where residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving and one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake followers created to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral\nRight but the fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically uh bought accounts generated out of water known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these uh physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power in politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nBy it and now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspects\nOf a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for tendency Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you solve similar campaigns plane out on Instagram to ah there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing the echo effect and to the broader population including the media itself\nOne of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether it's swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about

weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how a social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were in ...\nSeeing the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of law is it something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you solve both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on ... do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that these social media platforms are private companies are and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just ... but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking\nAnd so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nThe auto club worked hand in hand with the city to do that and turn the street in front of their historic headquarters south of downtown ... into kind of testing ground for new ideas like what is the first traffic signals\nYou don't have a concrete base Senate rose up fourteen feet\nWith signals to go or stop\nStanding at that intersection today you can\nSee the legacy those efforts a street that is much more order than the old days but also more dominated by cars Norton the historian says that may not last\nThe victory of automobiles in the Nineteen twenties is proof that what streets are for can be changed innovation he says is a powerful force the popularity of scooter ring is actually I think pretty good evidence that people are looking for something different\nAnd if we in two thousand Eighteen take the same kind of approach of reexamining our laws are social norms and our infrastructure\nWe can reinvent streets again and there's no reason why we shouldn't\nLike it or not ease scooters could someday become just another part of our streets gate in Los Angeles and making the credit to Reno for marketplace [noise]\n\n\nThis followed all the way out to do some economic inside perhaps into the big

a journalist and turkey who retweet something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands and a Turkish prison so governments can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China's presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say\nTo a what you buy can all be monitored and has brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness\nSo for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent\nIf you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a free\nCharges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles sort affects uh how attractive the person you're gonna be able to go on dates or even Mary\nAnd I what's notable about this what goes in a way that or will never could've imagined\nIs the network side of it your score reflects not only what you do but what everyone else in your network does so if for example your brother is not being positive enough about the regime online your score will go down so then you'll go to your brother and say hey you know get it together\nAnd this is this a strange way of using technology in essence to steer us to a behavior that at least in China the government wants\nSo people who who have phones and do a lot of social media will have a social credit score the aim is so that eventually everyone will get one\n\nThe goal of it is to achieve a what's known as mass control to steer an entire population towards a certain direction\nIt's not just the idea that um you will have your online activity but the government will force you to have this kind of Internet presence of for example there are certain um places in China where there are police checkpoints physical checkpoints where they will check your smartphone to ensure that you have the votes that allows monitoring of you\nWrite and just just to get a sense of the region does I mean do we know how many people now have social credit scores in China is it hundreds of thousands tens of millions\nI Believe it's tens of millions this is a gradually escalating process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs and credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a

donate thanks\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this what do they do\nSo it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the\nCampaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered then all of us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives at these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund or images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can\nUsing the Internet means and the like but it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cause and you know gain badges and the like\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts these were in essence fake follow worse\nCreated to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real on line following by driving your messages viral\nRight but the fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically uh bought accounts generated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost you think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these uh physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election and we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and\nThe result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big an number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAh it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on line\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to er there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing the echo effect and too\nThe broader population including the media itself one of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it\nAnd so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether it swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it was ...\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and social media ...
