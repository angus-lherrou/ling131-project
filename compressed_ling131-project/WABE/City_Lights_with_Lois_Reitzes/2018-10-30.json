... co wrote with Lee Cohen she joined us last friday from the studios of NPR West to talk about this story\nWell you know lowest about twenty five years ago I woke up after being engaged to play the green piano concerto myself\nAnd I thought wow this was the piece that my mother always told me about when she was a little girl growing up in Vienna the dream that she had to become a concert pianist and make her debut in that piece [noise]\n\nMaybe I could write a book\nMaybe I could find a way to tell her story if I could bring it especially the young people\nBecause I felt that the messages and the story very much because my mother held on to music and the darkest times\nAnd went after a dream a despite so many obstacles and challenges I felt that those messages would really really inspiring impact my readers the audience is if I could ever get it out there and so I Am an example and I tell this to young people now when I bring the story\nOf someone who never gave up on a dream and it was it wasn't easy and I went through rejections and lots of stuff along the way and finally I caught a book published called the children of last in line\nAnd so to speak the rest was history for me I got it launched\nAnd I'm so many wonderful educational foundations believed in the power of it\nOn the Milken Family Foundation facing history and ourselves and they helped me to grow and an educational initiative built around the book and the performances um\nThen my path crossed about I Would say about eight years ago with his phenomenal artist by the name of her she felt her he fell in love with the story and he took a chance on me he says\nLet's see if we can adapt this for a one woman a theatrical production\nSo I plunged in really not knowing much about at all about the theatrical world I mean after all my background was a concert pianist but I had a fire in my heart to want to do it and I studied\nHe took a chance on me he bought me an audition that the gas and play house we open the show a called the pianist of rules didn't land based on the book\nAnd it was was wonderfully received when we went month after month after month and then he started touring me and the last set of years he's brought me really across America and recently to London and two shows to a um theatrical run to the St James theater [noise]\nAnd um [noise] along the way I kept growing my educational mission because I felt it was so important to try to ... ... in large the audiences to young young students and so we've grown that\nInto what we call the wheels didn't read aware ... through the foundation we gift copies of the books to school districts\nAnd then we do an abridged version of the show in a large theater I'm\nJust in a few days now here in Los Angeles I'm going to be bringing the Wilson read to twelve thousand students at the door the channel to Brazilian in Los Angeles just came from ah Portland where thousands have been reading it\nAnd then I'll make my way to Pittsburgh were nearly I think Seventeen thousand students are reading the book right now and we'll experienced uh experience the show so when my past crossed with ambassador steward Eisen staffed\nWho saw the performance in Washington DC about half a year ago on behalf of the defiant requiem foundation\nKey I saw the power of the story and the potential and then he came to see my performances again recently at the Kennedy Center where we did the theatrical run and he bestowed upon me the great honor to come to Atlanta and bring this performance ah\nTo the to this year's Stuart

charities that move thousands of European children to safety in England\nThat was a mixed blessing that can hurt transport\nWhat was the impact Tom families sending children way\nRight or a powerful question as you can imagine I often ask myself what was my grandmother feeling that day when she put my mother on the train\nAnd said goodbye to her and actually that particular scene at the train station which my mother told me about over and over when I was a little child is the number one reason why why I set out to tell the story and want to share it with the world [noise]\nMy mother would put me to sleep at night or sometimes in the piano lessons when she taught me and she would tell me how her mother\nAt the best one ... train station took her face in our hands and begged her to keep a promise which was to hold onto your music and I'll be with you every step of the way through the music\nAnd my mother you know just didn't want her mother to see that she was crying but she made a vow that she would hold onto that music and that her mother would be there with her\nSo at the age of fourteen she was put on that train\nAnd I often wonder what did my mother feel as the train sped away and the story then becomes what happened to her when she arrived in England\nAlong with these other ten thousand Jewish children who are all scattered to hostile to homes or to farms different parts of England\nAnd my mother begins this incredible journey or that actually takes or near brightened a into a place called peacock\nHer where she was put to work she worked as a seamstress\nAnd at night time she would sneak down to the parlor where the piano was an ... allowed to play the piano so she played above the keys and imagined that her mother and father were listening to her and her sisters and it's a very pivotal moment in the story because even though she's safe and has plenty to eat [noise]\nShe thinks her self as the music feels her up this was not why they chose her\nBecause to go back in the story my grandfather was only able to cure one ticket\nAnd the family had three daughters\nSo the decision of who they were going to choose\nWas so excruciating\nAnd they chose my mother and she would often tell me because they felt that the music would give her the strength\nHow does this story move from\nPage to stay well\nIf you're lucky enough you meet someone like her she found her\nWho takes the chance on you and has the genius to um combined music music and storytelling\nWhen I met him I had a little prototype because the book could come out\nAnd the publishing house with Tammy around the country to do book signings and different things and they felt that the power would also be through the music so sometimes they would roll is spin it into the bookstore um and I would do a little taste of it\nSo I kind of a of model of what I wanted to do but I had no clue of how you would bring it to the theater\nAnd it was my lucky day when it crossed with a comfortable artist who then took the embryos so to speak and gave birth to the baby he designed an extraordinary set\nOf um incredible golden frames ... through which he projected a world lost\nA the Europe that
