explored\nGreat question so\nFrank Rich the New York times theater critic of many many years says that ... are the last song writing team that connects us what a great Broadway show sounded like in the Arab before rock and roll and they were writing in the sixties seventies eighties nineties and up to now\nSo they're the inherit hers and body errors of this very old tradition of Gershwin and Cole Porter and Irving Berlin\nBut they have also been consistent innovators in how music is used how songs are thought of and conceived within musicals they\nThey write a certain kind of glitzy brass the show busy tune but they'll often put it in context that is very surprising they they're songwriting is incredibly accessible and catchy\nBut their choice of stories to musical eyes are often incredibly challenging and dark and in that sense this sort of boy\nMeets girl boy loses girl gets boy gets girl back again model of what musicals has often been for many many years with sort of turned on its head and as we talk through today will also look at the way\nThe kind of pure Rogers and Hammerstein model of what a musical theater song looks like we're sort of turned around a little bit in their use\n... ... America on Broadway in the late Nineteen sixties some theatre goers were taken back that there was a music cold\nSat in Berlin during the rise of not see that point didn't come up ten years earlier when the sound of music for say hit\nBut that had a happy ending it didn't have the new ... story of cabinet rank how was Cabot re\nA more a reflection of the Nineteen sixties mindset in French during which time it was written um even though the story if cabaret sets in late Nineteen twenty ...\nMy alley from the Nineteen Seventeen students filling in for that and this cabaret she was not on prop ...

American song buck\nEastern Morton who has written several books about Broadway musicals has said that Chicago is eight too easily underestimated show\nAt Chicago was a Broadway success and an Oscar winning best picture movie music ... what deserves more appreciation than that I think probably\nWhat he was responding to is that when the show came out it was in the same general era of a chorus line and which was such a runaway hit that you you know in red set all these records for how long it ran given the strength of the score the brilliance of conception\nThere there probably were many people at the time who thought this should run forever I think what's happened as um as time has gone by is that uh\nCargo has sort of proven that it you know there's this revival started I think in Ninety six and continues to run than they made the movie in the early to thousands that won the Oscar so to some degree I think\nThat that person writing again might say well now it's ... re assessed enough to know what a major major musical it's been\nOh I I think the score is sensational ... what should we start with from Chicago let's start right at the top all that jazz\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay we're in the seventies but still are back in the twenties and all that wonderful\n... that sound and oh ... ... that winning ...\nYou ain't kidding so um to just take a step back\n... ah have\nVery different personalities candor grew up in the mid west in Kansas City both Jewish kids and they came to New York well he came to New York I'm Fred ab grew up in New York\nThey ended up um one went to Oberlin and then Colombia the other one to NYU and then Colombia and they started working in the in the musical theater universe and they shared a music publisher\nAnd the music publisher said you guys have to meet each other and they brought them together and they started ... immediately according to both of them they just clicked\nCandor can improvise at the piano and have an idea and just play along\nAnd Arab can can edit could evidently improvise in rhythm and at first so they would just start messing around with ideas and one of the things that you know going back to these these musicals that are set an earlier era is both of them talk about\nImmersing themselves in the musical or the literary world of an earlier era to really so here they're writing\nWhat they call the vaudeville where they took a bunch of styles from an earlier era and gave each of the characters are kind of a big number that was\nReferencing a star or a style from that era which they just totally immerse themselves in and they kind of nail it and the big idea here is that\nA um a a murderer a woman who is who is killed a lover becomes a kind of sensation or uses her infamy for her own ends to kind of become famous as a of vaudeville in in that area and so they were really beginning to talk\nAbout something that I is still very present today where people talk about [noise]\nUh I heard Roger Stone the the political commentator say it's better to be\nInfamous than not known at all and this idea of driving how do we get our a storyline and make ourselves famous and make ourselves successful is sort of at the center of what Chicago's about now going to go into this idea of what the form it is that makes it so innovative on top of that\nThese a lot of these songs can exist in The Mind's eye of the protagonist\nSo instead of again bursting out into song the protecting us ten sort of fancy herself her she's a she's a woman who's killed her husband but as her\nHer unhinged mine she's a budding star so she's consistently casting all of the people in her life as these these sort of huge show stopping figures in vaudeville house let's listen to the press conference rag\n\nWas raised in one more stark reminder of\nThey stole my hot are waking\nUp this there's enough water beautiful morning in Oklahoma\nYou know no and again going back to this idea of how they're using song\nShe pictures her lawyer as a person able to sort of hold stage and and become the the giant\nPuppet master and he holds a press conference to work the press and get her more fame and also kind of control her story and in most staging of it are in the film rendering\nShe's sitting on his lap as a sort of dummy a kind of a ... and you see the press as the sort of Mary Annette being manipulated by him so\nThey wrote a song it functions it tells the story it's not anybody bursting into song it's people in a sort of fantasy world it's it's really kind of a mind blowing of how complicated and weirdly simple it is\nThink there are many people on the campaign trail right now we're talking about climate change although I don't know maybe after this report perhaps more people are talking about it but what do you think it's going to take for us as Americans to finally do what coral described and tell our lawmakers like we do not want this country to turn into a scene from the day after tomorrow you have to do something right now\nTo things um first of all the most encouraging trend is that businesses are ... are now

[noise] one week after\nThe release of incredible to came back Scott ... of the Jurassic Park installments this time Jurassic World all in ...\nAnd those I hate to spoil the plot for you what this was a movie about dinosaurs who get Boston cause problems for you but [laughter] um [noise] this movie was just not very good I'm just going to say that over the airwaves but it's still grossed over one billion dollars so apparently [noise]\nSomebody like that [noise] the sequel but the sixth one is already being planned and you would think there'd be some kind of limit to how much mileage you can get out of a plot of dinosaurs getting loose on an island\nBut um [noise] people keep coming back to it and what is nice about the whole franchise is one aspect of Michael ... she knows writing but I think he's very respectful to what's come before him and so all of us know the famous John Williams Jurassic Park themes\nMichael has assumed leadership poor ... secret franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek planet of the apes drastic park where maybe other [noise]\nSame component would say I am not going to follow that [noise] um but he treats the ... Williams in others very reverential lean also brings his own spin\nAnd new music to the table um there's a segment in the opening track of the fallen kingdom which is another plenty title this title makes me drastic [laughter] heritage [noise]\n\nOr\n\n\n\nJust tell her symphonic writing so good I think he must have a blast just kind of picking up percussion instruments and when you use brash and would wins and strings and of course he brings in the old Alfred Newman choir in the back here to give us a kind of\nOther worldly president ... uh which makes it very ... Kim and makes it seem more important than in fact I think sometimes can make a bad movie a little less bad [laughter]\nI um I Love his writing Andy is a sense of drama that he brings to a lot of the soundtracks another fabulous cue from ... is the march of ... which brings some big brass into the mix to vilify one of the villains\n\n\n\nAnd after dinner [noise] my mother and my brother and I um got pretty heated argument [noise]\nThere was maybe a little bit of wind and whiskey involved\nAre but we got this big argument about the election and what struck me was that we all were on the same side we all voted for the same person varying levels of enthusiasm but all on board fully all in and I was just thinking gosh if we are\nArguing like this and we were all wind what's going on other holiday tables and then as I started talking to friends of mine who had gone home to whether it's Illinois Ohio St Louis [noise]\nUm and start talking to other family mind I was realizing that this election has permanently changed the way we go into holiday dinner so [laughter] I think for a long time you were able to sidestep the political conversation but now it is it's very difficult to do that so I wanted to take that\nGeneral kind of feel of of uncomfortable with the holiday table and just blow it up\nAnd there is some blowing fight ... writing and directing this movie package to try to strike that balance between a family comedy and the horrific drama I mean at the same time\nI was um you know I I when I was young I saw this movie that you might know called Mrs Mitt ever starting earlier Carson William ... amazing I remember even as a little kid\nBeing taken it how even though it's one cohesive movie\nIt has to get a feeling of two different stories right the first kind of part of it is life in this ... English village during the war and you know it's kind of funny and stuff and then the second half of it as the Nazis in the house and we have to hide so I I knew\nThat um you know there are movies that exists a lot of movies in the seventies did that bubble and did that I didn't name where you kind of walk that line there's something very tragic happens and there's a big joke so um\nI I knew that was my goal and I didn't know if it was going to work really until my editor showed me the assembly of the movie and then I think we all breathe a sigh of relief because we knew on some level that the the balance\nWas was there and I know you are a\nGood friend and collaborator with Jordan Peele few years in Amsterdam we do have their to theater company there there were times watching get out that I wondered if this was\nThere were times watching the oath that I Wonder if this was a bit of a tribute\nAnd ... there was a good public or\nAnd a mile to get out um to\nJordan Peele give you any advice or were you thinking yes\nVery much um first of all I had already written a draft in my movie and then I went to the premier of get out and I came home at night and I said to my wife I Can't go to sleep I have to do another rewrite because they heeded some excess special and and I wanted to tweak my own story [noise] ah but Jordan was one of the first people to see it and she\nShe gave me a great compliment he said you've taken your soul and put it onto a film and uh but then he also gave me some really good practical advice which which kind of relates to set the tone when we were talking about which is [noise]\nYou know in the earlier cuts of the movie um you know I Would have something kind of crazy that happened or something dramatic or violent and then I put it you know a joke to cut it\nAnd what I was doing is I Would put another joke which recall on comedy putting a hat on ... or ... and Jordan was like yeah I think if you put in too many jokes after something dramatic it will be kind of\nBuild dull everything and we'll make the audience a sharp to what you're trying to do so that was a really huge kind of went back and just did another call of a whole bunch of kind of jokes or things that we were kind of funny and uh it made the movie a lot better\nBecause it is not easy to can ... and you're doing that in the ... yeah it is it's\nIt's tough but you know I think we have our goal was if you play everything is kind of real as possible even with kind of heightened characters who were on their own different political arenas um you know the more real and grounded it is I think ... the easier it is to kind of blend genres well\nSpeaking of over the top character\nIn the post your character isn't used\nTo unseat avidly listening to pod save America yes Jon Lovett did it in his voice you know how you play it in the heart of podcast host [laughter] and your\nYour character and Chris is watching lots of cable news it's a wonder his

um Donald Trump I knew that he was very obsessed with loyalty probably because he was involved with rights\n... father John McCarthy and I was very obsessive McCarthyism and stuff so I knew that loyalty was this big thing and as we were deeper and deeper in the process of writing and shooting and stuff things would happen in real life like I had already started writing a draft of it and then there was always remember early on there was a\nA cabinet meeting where they all went around the circle and like I'm proud to be loyal to you and then a few weeks later he you know a famously kind of
