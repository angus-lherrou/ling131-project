I Know there are listeners who will be curious\nAbout um the way in which you land a variety of style and\nOur particular artists who wins buyer you didn't mix classical and the other form\nI think there\nWell I have an appreciation for fusion artist period\nUm I think it's difficult for me to talk about what I Do without talking about I think kind of the first mother really of living ... who's though he cheating and Zoe cheating I think kind of popped onto the scene is a looping cellist maybe almost a decade ago and she's been doing really amazing things and while I'm not heavily influenced so much by\nHer style just what she does in terms of creating these beautiful landscapes and and using looking to do that is you know that's definitely\nThat's definitely an inspiration\n[noise] but I'm a much more interested in some ways and uh you know people who break the boundaries between you know it it best out of the genre walls right so one of my very favorite artist as many men embed hunt who actually have some time here in Atlanta and now he's out in LA and he's a soul\nFunk full a rock punk\nRight and and so all of those elements are very much in his music not necessarily in every single song but he chooses a genre that matches the emotion that's important for him to communicate and he's competent enough to do so um\nI Hope I'm confident enough to do so but you know my music is the intersection of classical and jazz you know I I Would say totally with regard to skills and and chords and and song structure I'm a I'm kind of a classical musician\nBut in terms of well not so much lung structure classroom edition but I'm a jazz artist with regard to you know I had an improvising and then just style in general you know the kinds of ways that touch my instrument or create sounded like\nAnd I like to use that intersection then to travel to spend some time and there was I don't know if you would know that there's that percussion beat as I go go beat from DC so there's a little go go there and you know sometimes there's funk music there's definitely reggae I'm there spoke this classical so I just enjoy traveling you know life life\nIt's a wonderful blend
