he brings in the old Alfred Newman choir in the back here to give us a kind of other worldly presence out which makes it very ... makes it seem more important than in fact I think sometimes can make him a bad movie\nA little less bad when I um I Love his writing and is a sense of drama but he brings to a lot of the soundtracks another fabulous cue from ... is the march of ... which brings some big brass into the mix to vilify one of the villains [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nArguing like this and we were all lined what's going on other holiday tables and then as I started talking to friends of mine who had gone home to whether it's Illinois Ohio St Louis [noise]\nUm and start talking to other family mine I was realizing that this election has permanently changed the way we go into holiday dinner so [laughter] I think for a long time you were able to sidestep the political conversation but now it is a ... it's very difficult to do that so I wanted to take that\nGeneral kind of feel of of uncomfortable idiot the holiday table and just blow it up\nAnd there is some blowing fight ... writing and directing this movie package to try to strike that balance between a family comedy and a horrific drama I mean it at the same time\nI was um you know I I when I was young I saw this movie that you might know called Mrs miner for starting earlier aggression William ... amazing I remember even as a little kid\nBeing taken it how even though it's one cohesive movie\nIt has to get a feeling of two different stories right the first kind of part of it is life in this past store all English village during the war and you know it's kind of funny and stuff and then the second half of it is the Nazis in the house and we have to hide so I I knew\nThat um you know there are movies that exists a lotta movies in the seventies did that bubble and did that thing where you kind of walk that line there's something very tragic happens and there's a big joke so [noise] um I I knew that was my goal and I didn't know if it was going to work\nReally until my editor showed me the assembly of the movie and then I think we all breathe a sigh of relief because we knew on some level that the\nThe balance was was there [noise]\nAnd I know you are a good friend and collaborator with Jordan Peele out a few years have you ever in Amsterdam we'd go out there to theater company there there were times watching get out that I wondered if this was\nThat ... times watching the oh is that I wondered if this was a bit of a tribute\nAnd ... there was a good public or a are worse than a mile to get out I'm\nJordan Peele give you any advice or were you see can yes\nVery much and first of all I had already written a draft or my movie and then I went to the premier of get out and I came home that night and I said to my wife I Can't go to sleep I have to do another Iraq because they he just did some excess special and and I wanted to tweak my own story [noise] uh but Jordan was one of the first people to see it and she\nShe gave me a great compliment he said you've taken your soul and put it onto a film and uh but then he also gave me some really good practical advice which which kind of relates to set the tone when we were talking about which is [noise]\nYou know in the earlier cuts of the movie um you know I Would have something kind of crazy that happened or something dramatic or violent and then I put it you know a joke to cut it\nAnd what I was doing is I Would put another joke which we call on comedy putting a hat on the ... or ... and Jordan was like yeah I think if you put in too many jokes after something dramatic it will it kind of\nBuild dull everything and we'll make the audience a sharp to what you're trying to do so that was a really huge now we kind of went back and justice\nAnother ... of a whole bunch of kind of jokes or things that we were kind of funny and uh it made the movie a lot better\nBecause it is not easy to can bind ... and you're doing that in the ... yeah it is it's\nIt's tough but you know I think we ... our goal was if you play everything is kind of real as possible even with kind of heightened characters who were on their own different political arenas um you know the more real and grounded it is I think ... the easier it is to kind of blend genres well\nSpeaking of over the top\nCharacter in the soles your character is a news\nJunkie avidly listening to ... save America yes John ... yeah you're his voice you know how you play it has been part of podcast host [laughter]\nAnd your your character and Chris is watching lots of cable news it's a wonder his wife can\nLive with this let's listen to a bit of Christ the news junkie\nSo Chris I'm I'm signing at\nHow is that possible dude\nWhere were the guys we were the

right now this is first hand\nWhat God [noise] is that first hand it it it's it's like third hand\n[laughter] I got to tell you I cannot believe that I'm an NPR and the word for word [laughter] but as I said so taste thank you and that is true I was going for a tasteful you say that\nI'm with America's\nPolitical situation changing\nOn an almost hourly basis for their times\nWhen like your character you would be checking your iPhone or find didn't need to\nChange something in the script constantly constantly you know initially we knew that the idea of a family fighting about politics and Thanksgiving was kind of a setting for the movie but I needed I needed this this other thing that's kind of overriding government threats and and [noise]\nYou know even though we have a fictional president and our movie um the more I started reading about um Donald Trump I I I knew that he was very obsessed with loyalty\nProbably because he was involved with Roy Cohn who was involved John McCarthy and I was very obsessive McCarthyism and stuff so into the loyalty was this big thing and as we were deeper and deeper in the process of writing and shooting and stuff things would happen in real life like\nI had already started writing a draft of it and then there was always remember early on there was a [noise]\nA cabinet meeting where they all went around the circle and like I'm proud to be loyal to you and then a few weeks later he you know a famously kind of ... your loyalty you got to be loyal and and it was this weird kind of case of you know\nLife imitating art that was already imitating life so we were just kind of like what's gonna happen we gotta get this movie out as\nWell another important theme in the movie is the relationship between your character Chris and his brother who is played by your real ally brother the actor John\nBarren no we have a clip of Christ and pat let's listen to the tournament is right now right there from\n\nOptics are studying ... hours seven term congressman and head of the Congressional Black caucus\nThe LA [noise] unbelievable [noise]\nWhat did he do nothing mom into anything getting nothing he led a copy of the oath on fire

politicians to be in handcuffs ... [noise]\nWhat a hot topic [laughter]\nOkay a lot of that ... sounds like Morse code but we get the idea of the relationship the Chris and his brother Patrick who clearly have different politics is any if pat\nBased on ... on no no no no I mean only the Simpson him and I will argue about stuff um you know politically were free on his younger than me so easily you know he's a little cooler and stuff but yeah no he's not like that but if it was so\nGreat having him play this part because I knew he was a great actor he had you know I'd seen him do a play at the stepping off training center in Ohio that race that great great great great actor and I knew that you know there's a lot of great actors out there but none of them\n...

E. dot org you can tell a lot about ... from the titles she chooses for his various projects brown and friendly and now the terrorists but I played on on TV\nWell we went a little bit deeper with the Iranian foreign comedian when he was in Atlanta and sharing his Netflix special immigrant came out last year laws talks a lot about his ethnicity and that act\nWe revisit a conversation now that we had which are probably about\nWhat it's been like being a proud immigrant in the Iraq\nI first started my career earlier my career I as an actor of Middle Eastern descent they start sending you out on auditions and um you at first it was a couple of you know just regular whatever security guard or a guy robbing a store or whatever then it was like oh terrorists and there was another terrorism ... and I ended up doing a couple of those\nAnd I really felt bad doing it I just didn't like doing it so I told my agent and I and managers and stuff I said guys I don't want to do anymore these\nSo I have been able to not do any more terrorists parts now\nAgain being Middle Eastern they're still gonna be a lot of times where people will call you up and go hey I got this guy's a falafel shop owner do might play have ordered a cab driver and know honesty I didn't I didn't mind those as much because in my opinion when I when I go to New York city or when I'm In Los Angeles I get in a cab\nIt was a lot of times it was a Middle Eastern guy when I Would go to a falafel place it was a Middle Eastern guy I worked as a kid in marine county in northern California I worked in a deli and the manager was an Arab American guy um so I think those characters I Know\nAnd so I don't mind play some of those characters so superior donors to characterize playing ... was an Iraqi immigrants who was a businessman who moved to Chicago bought up a lot of buildings and was trying to buy the donut shop that was owned by John harsh\nNow in my opinion even though in the show he would say a lot of inappropriate stuff he was kind of the Danny DeVito character from taxi or the ... character from cheers\nIt's still was a lot often it was a what I felt like they were giving me a lot of punch lines which was which was good\nAnd also I talked to the writers about they were actually a very good about saying let's not just make it all\nIraq centric Arab centric um unless if we're saying like oh you Americans are complaining here you know back in my country is a lot of that stuff is fine but I thought that they did a pretty good job with this character the thing that I liked about the character even though now\nAs an actor I Want to now the next character I Do I'd like to do without an accent I'd like to just do something closer to myself\nI'm this character had an accent 'cause he moved from Iraq recently but the thing that I liked about it was every week when we would be on air I Want to be on Twitter people would be talking about how enjoy how they were enjoying this character and in my mind I'm thinking okay they're watching a ...\nThey're the Arab American who has a ... you know has an accent and they're laughing and sub cautiously I feel like that is in Deering immigrants from that part of the world to people in America\nYou check off quite a few diversity boxes but scant tiring for people whose job it is tough to be funny or who just want to act do you ever wish you could drop politics and just tell jokes\nThat you could do a show and it could be a career I'm before that it was like oh shows are just something that I guess has done is sort of government service\nAnd we knew that nobody watched any Canadian TV mhm um but it was always on um you know other than hockey no one watched anything so um so so when I see TV came along I went oh wow Canadian TV can be hip and and uh and\nReally a great fun to watch\nIt's hard to imagine it's hard to look back and imagine now that like at one point\nYou know because nobody knew who the kids in the hall were and like there was a there was a point is rapidly approaching it again [laughter] there was a there was a point before success but ah but looking back now how do you see any of your own influence in uh in contemporary comedy now\nUm sometimes I arrogant Lee think I Do ... um and then sometimes I actually hear from people that that uh we did have an influence ... you know I I I Know that uh I'm a Freda are missing has has a set very kindly that uh\nWhen they're working on something else on Portland area that they would think OK well how would the kids in the hall and this and then they'll they'll actually referenced us directly\nYou know and I think I think there was I think they may have been some influence on like key and Peele short on you know I could definitely see that and I think they kind of carry on like sort of the film like stuff that we were doing yeah they did it better than\nUs [laughter] the other big show that you're you're known for news radio or is still one of the funniest goofy workplace comedies that's been on television that that that's my opinion obviously I agree with that whole yeah I I went back to that I gather all yeah I Love that show\nUh I mean you could even see it as a precursor to shows like parks and recreation or super store which one of your former workmates is yeah the tall and I can't remember his name [laughter] what was it that made that show work\nI I think it starts with the same thing with the kids all starts with the writing I think and button is really had a great a pulse Simms was a great writer and a had a a really strong sensibility about what he wanted to show to be\nAnd he put together a really sort of a very hip young\nGroup or writers to work on it and and again it was a\nHe was you know he was dealing with like universal things was you know again why they get that I don't think feel stale and\nOld yeah for for for a show that was about a news program there was no news [laughter]\nKnow topical like topical it get references to Pataki is that yeah that was that ... character was constantly working on a Pataki interview that was that those are are almost a news the I mean and you\nMentioned more and the the I mean some of the credit needs to go to the fact that\nAs an ensemble all day all put together a great group of people yeah uh yeah I mean you know it was I mean I I think it was one of the best casts ever forever uh put together in of seemed to I've certainly thrilled to be a part of it\nI mean uh everyone remembers Jimmy boroughs who directed the first bunch of shows we did he said he liked it it was like a ... says like on cheers you said you know there was you could go to any one for the laugh\nAnd he said that was true of our cast that you'd go to any one he had complete faith and every single person in the cast\nI mean it it comes through in\nThe in the performance is I mean and the the show really sort of nailed this sort of manic energy of a an and really took advantage of the hum of the format of the show as a as a multi chem sitcom\nYeah it was it had a very uh especially the pace the Jimmy set for it\nWas very sort of fluid and very ... very theatrical in a way I'm not ... not that it was over top performers in any way 'cause I think we kind of did a very naturalistic style of acting on the show yeah but that everything was constantly emotion people were always moving\nA you'd get I'd be especially in the early days when I was in every scene or I Would be exhausted so because I Would constantly be running all over the set yeah it's something like a joke would be set up in one camera and then it would pay off\nIn the in the next shot yeah and it was like and everything was always is is that everything was always in motion everything was always overlapping and uh\nIt had a real kind of a Howard Hawks kind of feel to it if you if you like old movies folks\nUh that sort of match cap energy yeah I always say like the like the best the best example of how all sitcom should be shot is or his girl friday\nAnd a which is an old Howard Hawks movie and uh that's kind of what news radio felt like when we're making it if you know we did very long scenes we do like ten ten minutes without a without us without a cut yeah you know and which you don't not many people get to do any more [noise]\nThat was comedian Dave Foley
