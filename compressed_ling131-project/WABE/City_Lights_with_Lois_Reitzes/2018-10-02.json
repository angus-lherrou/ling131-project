Cole Porter\nBill ... Robinson Richard Rodgers when ... and she says she knew everybody she worked with everybody they all respected the heck out of her when Obama gave his inauguration speech as\nThe forty fourth president of the United states he actually reference lyrics by fields he said in the speech starting today we must pick ourselves up\nDust ourselves off and began again the work of remaking America and this alludes to the song pick yourself up from the film swing time that she wrote the lyrics for\nSo why do we know more about her why is her name not a household word I think you believe that sexism has something to do it that I'd\nSo I mean if we made a list of all of the people who were the important musical theater contributors as writers certainly there are a lot of great performers as women but if we made a list of all the folks who are on the other side of the foot lights there wouldn't be that many women who are part of the list and I actually\nThink that in some ways sexism has been hard baked into the American theater\nFrom its very beginnings in fact a lot of critics say that the first American musical happened in Eighteen sixty six just after the civil war\nAnd uh the there was this show which\nThe reason is credited as being the first big musical is that it had a plot and then there were songs interspersed throughout throughout this show but here some some other weird facts about it it it ran five and a half hours long [laughter] so it's called the black crook and it was based\nUp sort of spouse like tail of a deal with the devil in the sixteen hundreds all the critics said it was terrible the songs were from other things they were thrown in kind of haphazardly\nSo low is why was it the biggest hit of the year and in fact of the decade ran for four hundred and Seventy four performances because it could expand it well\nThe critics panned it but the largely all male audience didn't get enough because there were a hundred ballerinas [laughter] showing a little bit of leg\nOh am I so you can make an argument that the the launch of the American musical happens because of the objective vacation of women\nAre the ballet gave way to the field\nIt's kind of started this tradition and so there's it's very common for women to be sort of up on one side of of the theater is kind of objects\nBut they're just hadn't been that many people who are making theater so Dorothy Fields comes along she is the daughter of a great vaudeville in a guy named Lou fields who was part of of vaudeville team called Webber and fields and they were famous for amongst many other jokes this joke that went something like\nUm who is that lady I saw you with last night and then the other one said that was no lady that was my wife I yeah\nHas to let her daddy didn't want her in\nThe U.S he didn't he didn't in fact when she announced that she was writing songs for\nA review that was going to happen on Broadway he famously said that is no thing for a lady to do and she cleverly said I Know like I'm your daughter\nOh that's great well let's listen to the first song ... chairs and this date from the year Nineteen twenty eight\nWho may be a good hobby to learn that\nMaybe they do they do\nNow you know when you're not that that really\nNegative negative negative thing and they get they get to\nVote very big and they get their mind they [noise] they don't think I think it's your job or you're going to let some of that and I\nDon't think they know [noise]\nYou'll just cleverness as lyricist was recognized pretty early she was in her early twenties and she started collaborating with some songwriters of the day we're working for\nCompanies that were trying to get their songs on tour and she got hired by reviews and then eventually by the cotton club which that was a big gig the cotton club was a major\nPlace where African American performers would present it and a vis vis number did they could do was meant for cotton club review\nWhen it premiered it's already got suggestive lyrics lyrics or things like you love me and I love you and when you love it's natural to dig it to do [noise] um but evidently the star of this um cotton club review actually put in even more suggestive lyrics kind of scandal is lyric so various fields with\nUh her dad hung out with her you know who is this was you know going to be a proud moment and the columnist Walter wind chill back the you know it's a packed house\nAnd she whispers over to our father\nThose are not the lyrics that I actually wrote and evidently Lou fields right after the number ran up on stage took some applause 'cause he was famous and said everybody I just liked to announce\nMy daughter did not write those loose [laughter]\nWell it's an interesting start to as long and remarkable career but what you're saying about um the continent club picking the south into ... to ... this was a milestone not only for feminism but also for race relations\nI think that there there are had been a bunch of white writers\nFor cotton club reviews and among some Harold Arlen who we've talked about before and everyone thought he was black yeah yeah and and uh I think the cotton club as a place where\nIn fact there were much more porous lines of collaboration and many of the other places in the U.S there ... there was more of a natural way of people just trying to put out good work\nThere was some controversy about the next song we'll hear I believed it was a lawsuit on behalf of fats Waller ... that she actually composed the song and not Jimmy NICU but\nThere was no to speak about the words that never came in to the complaints the words were written diet or the fields\n\nAnd [noise]\nBeen to New York [noise] [noise] um this day\nAnd it is quite a testament to David said there is that I now hear him when I hear Billie Holiday um the sunny side of history\nSo that someone was written for review and um [noise] I think one of the things that is so interesting about it is that of course it's a standard in a classic\nShe was very young when she wrote the songs and she's already showing such a deft handling of phrasing she gets a tune and she's able to place very colloquial lyrics\nIn in into the the musical phrases in a way that actually enhances the musical phrases\nThat I think you every person needs to do what's best for them or in my case I don't know who was so there's no point\nUm I I\nI I really think you know it's all about violation whatever form it takes is all about having your power taken away from you so whatever way you can reclaim your power\nI'm not going to judge and if that means naming that's great and if that means not naming that's also great I Do think that what Mara was talking about\nOf of ah you know a holding someone accountable you need to name someone in order to hold someone accountable and that ... not just ... in on the individual level but on the societal level and start looking at ways that we can hold

match the patriarchy\nChapter five is about beauty and opens with the question how does this patriarchy cosmetically didn't find us and how do we reconcile feminism with pressures to conform to beauty stand\nAgain we could talk for several hours or ride a doctoral dissertation on this book would you boil it down for us would you explain what you are trying to achieve in this chapter\nSo in terms of looking at beauty through the lens of patriarchy\nAgain we want to figure out what is patriarchy telling us to do and why\nAnd how much [laughter] aim is that taking up in our lives because we are essentially told we have to look a certain way and if we don't we don't fit into the conversation we don't fit into the world and the right way and that's that is pretty heavy\nSo but there's also this tension but I think is always gonna permeated feminist circles and conversations even up to today that wants to\nCreate a litmus test for feminist of Kenya wear lipstick and be a feminist can you actually care about you\nKnow trying to emulate Kamkar dash in beauty a static and be a feminist because of all of the patriarchal baggage that comes with women cosmetically I'm kind of defining themselves\nAnd the fact of the matter is that the answer to those questions is yes because feminism kind of has nothing to do really with whether you wear lipstick or not [laughter] but what we wanted to do was\nGive people the context of where those problematic areas are and beauty and what where those norms and expectations of how women ought to look like what where those come from and sort of the pressures they exert well also recognizing that a lot of people us included\nFind a lot of fun and self expression in beauty practices I'm wearing makeup Caroline by the way is wearing a bold thread lip it's a state of ... re let's stick as all [laughter]\nVery shy at like ... what topics like beauty especially there there's a tendency for us to see it as like something you can either have and be a feminist or not and it's like a purity test right right right\nAnd what we're offering is not a prescription of how you should live your life but rather again hopefully\nSome guidance for women to at least understand like why this beauty scenario exist to begin with and not\nHave to feel the need to apologize right foreign drawing wearing lipstick or um what would be considered traditionally feminine style clothing\nThere are so many things we impose on our so this book underscores what a mess it is just to sort through\nAll of the various identities and issues women have to

in one way just how real the need is for the kind of information that that Caroline and I are hopefully offering through and ladylike to validate that those kinds of\nTo validate it that kind of massage any Israel and it's not just on line and they aren't just you know bullies in a basement on the Internet um but that it's a symptom of\nSomething a lot bigger and it has a lot of different manifestations some of which seem totally benign you know but the fact that\nUh need us our cheesy and needs a bodyguard for an event where we're going to talk about women from history is outrageous\nThis book is hot off the press you mentioned Luis C K and three years ago could you ever have imagined that your completed volume would come during the me too movement no\nNo because we had no idea that we would be reading a book after Donald Trump was elected\nDo you think\nThat\nIt has extra weight the causes me to or do you think you too is just one more example of what you've been talking about for a year I think me too is um\nAn indication of what you were asking us earlier about communication and women speaking out but more than that women being heard um and so what I'm hoping friend lady like is that it not only give some context perhaps for me too but it's also part of that wave of women speaking out and being heard\nYou probably have listeners and you will have readers who do\nNo what color you are and one of the things that his best surely the wild on in this book on lady like is\nThe way that the book who dresses the intersection of race and gender\nYou are very comfortable blaming sing blaming things than using words like white broke [laughter]\nYeah tell us more [laughter] [noise] I think it's\nOur responsibility especially as a\nTwo white women born and raised in the south\nTo be extremely conscientious of how\nWe present the realities of race um because also\nI mean obviously this issue is not just exclusive to the south but it's so much stereotypically identified with it and also to construct of lady could which restricted really the respectability of women to being of a certain class and obviously of\nThe white race and at the time after the civil war you have these early early fashion magazines um and time culture magazines emerging for black women specifically addressing the lady who had a problem\nOf\nEncouraging them to dress in particular ways that could get around us actually like just the racist attitudes that people were walking around with 'em and they were part and parcel of the concept of being\nA lady and I think that that still ripple through feminism to human today\nRight and we knew as Christians said as to I'm white straight women that um we\nWe ... we owe does your audience to to continue our\nDedication to presenting more than just our perspective to making sure that as a reader you don't come away with the idea that certain issues only affect certain people that we're all affected by sexism by these is ... and ... yes sometimes it is worse if you are not white\nIt's difficult to uncover so much of what you have written about and and not\nFeel your temperature in your blood pressure how can you can deal with well\nI think one big thing is that we do know it'd be different if every literally every man around us was spewing hatred and vitriol and trying to literally and figuratively silence us but we do know that that's not true across the board obviously\nUm and I think one thing that has helped me maintain perspective is that so much of what we write about when we write about the patriarchy\nIs like\n... it just the air around us it's not necessarily that individuals are saying do this don't do this but it is more of like a social\nContext to a lot of our existence is and so that I mean at\nThe risk of making it sound even heavier um than it would be if it were just an individual person who you could you know yell at um I think that one thing that's nice to keep in mind is like this is like a collection of social attitudes and we can push back against that\nYeah because it\nSmashing the patriarchy\nIs not about smashing men\nUm and and ladylike is that much for men and boys as it is for women and non binary people because the crux of on lady like is a rejection specifically\nOf the ladies shaped box that women have been forced into over years\nUnder this system of patriarchy and women can be justice complicit in a reinforcing sexism and double standards\nAnd uh being cruel to other women just as much as men can so this isn't a takedown of\nMen but rather hopefully a guide for us to see just these systems and also the remnants of history that are still reincarnate throughout a our current time and that it's something that we all have a stake in\nRight and also that lady like an feminism at large benefit everyone not just women not just the women who are reading this book but we all have something to gain and saying oh\nIt doesn't have to be like this I thought it just was like that because you're a woman so you have to be this way and you're a man see you have to be this way if we look at why these things these beliefs these construct exist then we can say oh\nThere's another way to beat to think to access to interact to communicate and I can separate myself from those restrictive boxes whether it is a lady shaped box and you're expected to be proper or whether it is a macho man shaped box Caroline birth and\nKristen konger congratulations some on lady luck and thank you very much for joining me thank you thank
