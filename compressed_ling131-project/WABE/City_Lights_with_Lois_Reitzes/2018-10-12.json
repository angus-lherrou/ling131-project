times where people will call you up and go hey I got this guy's a falafel shop owner do might play him what are the cab driver and honesty I didn't I didn't mind those as much because in my opinion when I when I go to New York city or when I'm In Los Angeles I get in a cab\nIt was a lot of times it was a Middle Eastern guy when I Would go to a falafel place it was a Middle Eastern guy I worked as a kid in marine county in northern California I worked in a deli and the manager was an Arab American guy um so I think those characters I Know\nAnd so I don't mind play some of those characters so superior down as a character I was playing ... was an Iraqi immigrants who was a businessman who moved to Chicago bought up a lot of buildings and was trying to buy the donut shop that was owned by John harsh\nNow in my opinion even though in the show he would say a lot of inappropriate stuff he was kind of the Danny DeVito character from taxi or the ... character from cheers\nIt's still was a lot often it was a what I felt like they were giving me a lot of punch lines which was which was good\nAnd also I talked to the writers about and they were actually a very good about saying let's not just make it all\nIraq centric Arab centric um unless if we're saying like oh you Americans are complaining here you know back in my country is a lot of that stuff is fine but I thought that they did a pretty good job with this character the thing that I liked about the character even though now\nAs an actor I Want to now the next character I Do I'd like to do without an accent I'd like to just do something closer to myself\nI'm this character had an accent 'cause he moved from Iraq recently but the thing that I liked about it was every week when we would be on air I Want to be on Twitter people would be talking about how enjoy how they were enjoying this character and in my mind I'm thinking okay they're watching a character that Arab American\nWho has a ... you know has an accent and they're laughing and sub cautiously I feel like that is in Deering immigrants from that part of the world to people in America\nYou check off quite a few diversity boxes but scant tiring for people whose job it is tough to be funny or who just want to ask do you ever wish you could drop politics and just tell jokes\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact it's funny you say that because people and when I get ... sometimes people will go what's your what's your goal is a comedian what are you trying to do like that and I think they're leading towards the political goal and I say no I go my number one goes to be funny\nThat's what anyone's goal is as a comedian I Want to be funny now if I could if I can have a message underneath my comedy that I feel that that's going to another level I feel that that's the guys that I Want to emulate like Richard Pryor that George Carlin is that's what they were doing\nUm so you know be honest with you during the Obama era I didn't have as many political things going on\nUm and also my kids I have two young kids now seven and nine so they were born when Obama came and so there was a lot of kid material going on so my my material probably did go a little bit away from politics\nBut then once Trump gets back in it's like you got to start talking politics again so even if people see my show or even if you watch the image of special there's sections of the special where I'm doing family stuff\nThis political stuff and then there's just silly stuff\nAnd you can see some of that silly stuff in the comfort of your own home comedian mobster brownie its most recent special\nThat they would think OK we'll have with the kids in the hall and this and then they'll they'll actually reference us directly you know and I think I think there is I think they may have been some influence on key and Peele short and you know I could definitely see that and I think they kind of carry on like sort of the film stuff that we were doing yeah they did it better than us but [laughter]\nThe other big show that you're you're known for news radio or is still one of the funniest goofy workplace comedy is that's been on television that that that's my opinion obviously I agree with that the cool yeah I I Will either that or will gather all yeah I Love that show [noise]\nUh I mean you can even see it as a precursor to shows like parks and recreation or super store which one of your former workmates is yeah the tall and I can't remember his name [laughter] what was it that made that show work\nI I think it starts with the same thing with the kids all starts with the writing I think and but news radio had a great a pulse him so it was a great writer and a had a a really strong sensibility about what he wanted to show to be\nAnd he put together a really sort of a very young group or writers to work on it and and again it was a\nUse you know he was dealing with like universal things was you know the game when they get that I don't think it feel stealing old yeah for for for a show that was about a news program there was no news that we didn't know topical like topical it get references to Pataki is that\nYeah that was that ... character was constantly working on up attacking interview\nThat was that was that was art or almost a news the I mean and you\nMentioned Mara and the the I mean some of the credit needs to go to the fact that as an ensemble\nOf el put together a great group of people yeah uh yeah I mean you know it was I I mean I I think it was one of the best casts ever ever uh put together in of seems you know I've certainly thrilled to be a part of it\nI mean uh everyone remembers Jimmy boroughs who directed the first bunch of shows we did he said he liked it it was like a ... says like on cheers you said you know there was you could go to any one for the laugh\nAnd he said that was true of our cats that you'd go to any one he had a complete faith in every single person in the past I mean it comes through in\nThe in the performance is I mean and the the show really sort of nailed this sort of manic energy of a ... and really took advantage of the hum of the format of the show as a as a multi chem sitcom\nYeah it was it had a very uh especially the pace the Jimmy set for it\nWas very sort of fluid and very ... very theatrical in a way I'm not ... not that it was overtopped performance in any way 'cause I think we kind of did a very naturalistic style of acting on the show yeah but that everything was constantly emotion people are always moving\nA you'd get I'd be especially in the early days when I was in every scene or I Would be exhausted so because I Would constantly be running all over this at yeah\nIt's something like a joke would be set up in one camera and then it would pay off\nIn the state in the next shot yeah and there was like and everything was always is is that everything was always in motion everything was always overlapping and uh it had a real kind of a Howard Hawks kind of feel to it if you if you like old movies folks\nAh that sort of mad cap energy yeah I always say like the like the best the best example of how all sitcom should be shot is or his girl friday\nAnd a which is an old Howard Hawks movie and uh that's kind of what news radio felt like when we're making it with you know we did very long scenes we do like ten ten minutes without without us without a cut yeah you know\nAnd which you don't not many people get to do any more [noise]\nThat was comedian Dave Foley that's known for his acting days than TV sitcoms news radio and kids in the hall all\nDay Foley making call back to ancient Greek theater and Howard Hawks films\nIt gives you insight into how a wonderful comedic mind works and if you're anything like my colleague Mike John Kerry you've\nBeen watching and laughing at they fully for years and here on city lights you get to hear him in conversation about his craft [noise]\nI'm Lois right says you're listening to city
