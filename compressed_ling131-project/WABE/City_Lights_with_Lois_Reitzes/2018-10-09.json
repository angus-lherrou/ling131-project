overcome by the Holy Spirit and start speaking in tongues uh started on a martyr bus which I go into detail describing and the first piece\nAnd are giving sermons to unsuspecting strangers or I it was really actually great for me because it taught me how to memorize long passages of Bible verses which is very close to Shakespeare so you know gave me a leg up [laughter] um [laughter]\nAnd after that she started meeting up with a group I called the street creatures ganging down to the right across from underground Atlanta on the corner of Alabama and peach tree outside of five points downtown [noise]\nUm and that's it's about me healing with that after I confronted her about what it felt like now the play has ten character I found it in\nAll of whom are played by your words nice characters based on actual people or um ... are you sort of creating ... posh\nThere are composites there are two composite and they are um minor characters I'd say they are the two people that picked on me in

mother gave up her well\nEducated ... career she was a pharmacist yes I'm to follow her spirit so to speak um what was your reaction how old were you there\nWas raised with my mother being very fundamentalist Christian at for my brother was not he um he's four\nFour and a half years younger or older than I Am\nSo I was used to her I'm always proselytizing talking to us putting scripture she would write scriptures out and put them on the walls and give us a Bible studies before we left the house and we would have to memorize scriptures in versus\nUm so I always knew her as that when I turned twelve it was when I was twelve going into that really pivotal moment of puberty\nAnd that's when she kind of found her I don't know revelation enlightenment whatever you want to call it and that's when she felt like God was leading her out of pharmacy onto the street corners of Atlanta\nAnd working in fast food restaurant um this is information I did not include this earlier versions had this but [noise]\nUm so what did I feel I was I was primed to believe everything my mother told me so when you're primed to believe everything that your loved one tells you it doesn't really you don't have room to be um to care about yourself or to think about how it affects you\nAnd that's how I felt did you believe um the the message the word of God yes [laughter] yes I did\nI did um [noise] it's a very fragile place to be as a young person when someone is loving you providing for you and giving as they feed you nourishment for the body they're also feeding a nurse meant for your mind and there is no um physical abuse\nThere is no demarcation of abuse in the home so I just believed everything because I loved my mother of course you love and you accept yeah\nWhen did you stop accepting or begin question I started questioning\nAt Seventeen uh in Nineteen Ninety five the Atlanta Atlanta was getting ready for the Olympics in Ninety six and I started meeting people are asking questions about\nShouldn't and before we go and then we're low on time but I Wonder what role you think this will have and how officers in Chicago engage was Chicago wants to just make things better or worse or

move forward at a much faster pace with better training and\nMore transparency ...\nBecause now they know that\nWhat they never thought what happened and being exposed being caught and being tried could happen again I think uh they need to start better training for the officers I Do agree with both um the judge Cornell and major Frank claimed that the community needs to be involved it needs to be less\nMilitary base and more community friendly and just to add to that inspires out that has been dropped into neighborhoods and a half a million or what I Am a white Irish female\nBlonde hair

you care for them and so many of us love to eat\nAnd appreciate good cooking and home a homemade meal I mean for me that's just how I've grown up um I you know my father always cooked I we had big family meals and I I just sort of inherited that and my blood I think\nAnd I think you and body that notion of making space at the table both actually and so metaphorically I think you know you are a person when I've watched you over the years and as we've known each other over the years you\nAlways look to broaden the circle in Britain people and um even you know when you started the shop and you had people who were there just flinging suit but you didn't have them there is just singing soup you were doing all of your daily operations with the staff right extending ...\nLove and helping grow them as people and you know I just think that your notion of of broadening the family by making space at the table is just absolutely sort of runs through everything you\nDo [laughter] I have ... you can really\nUm tell a lot about one's character because it does involve to send her house do you describe rage and he's shaking and ... in clued in racing\nAnd cooking so comforting to me you know and

be taken out and waited on [laughter] my other people I'm Glad you're going to be J didn't cook for a living so that's so true I think when you look for a living and it's just a whole different ball

and\nI think that she learned she learned so much from the beginning to the end of this piece that you'll you'll see but I think she thinks that that's the answer\nUm but it's not necessarily the answer to what she's looking for but for her that's like how she shows her love to demand is like I'm going to cook for you and I'm going to save you and make you a better person and then it's all

what is the play\nIt tell us about love and the ... [noise]\nYou know we are talking yesterday about this and one of the things that I think is really beautiful about this is that uh I think in some ways Julio like many of us started out with this notion of I'm looking for this sort of perfect\nThing and every man she wouldn't meet she would try to have that perfect thing instantly and would sort of a ignore\nOr any of the imperfections are the quirks of these men in an attempt to sort of have that perfect thing\nAnd I think personally what this play embraces and talks about is that the perfect thing is not what you're looking for the thing you're looking for is the thing that is\nUm difficult and beautiful and complicated and something that you have to work to a really good meal isn't something you just grab off the shelf in a box and throw on the table right you want to pick these really nice ingredients and sometimes there's things you're not sure how they're going together and you mix them and you\nMake this sort of beautiful thing out of it but it's not that you look at it instant you know the very beginning and it's perfect and that's why you have it\nYou know there we were just apple picking a couple of weeks ago and they said you know don't worry about that stripe on some of the apples there was a frost\nAnd it made the strike but the apples are delicious and you know is that sort of thinking about it may not look exactly perfect or it might not be perfect instantly it's going to take some work and some combining and some effort\nAnd some sacrificing and some compromising um and then that's what you're going to end up with this beautiful at the end and I think that's what she she learned she eventually got married and twenty twelve right um so after many many many years of this disastrous states she found\nI think an imperfect but wonderful\nPartner and relationship might\nDirector Rachel May with actress Gemini laugh is and who appears in the one woman show I Love law stung made spaghetti produced by George ensemble theater opening night is October twenty fifth act the Roswell cultural art\nSet her support for WNBA comes from the Atlanta symphony orchestra presenting rebels love letter to Greek mythology the ballet deafness and Chloe Thursday on Saturday October eleventh and thirteenth details that they are so dot org classical series presented by Delta Airlines\nYear after Harvey Weinstein and me to New York is enacting the country's strictest workplace sexual harassment laws that story on the next all things considered from NPR News I'm driving home Atlanta from foreign 'til six thirty a Ninety point one WABC\nYou need facts and understanding and contacts and watch what you get from Ninety point one there's something else you can get a one year did you do subscription to the New York times it's yours with an early donation at ten dollars a month to WABC but\nOnce the member Dr starts later this week the New York times thank you gift jumps to get ten dollars a month so please make your early pledge now and she lives in New York Times at W.
