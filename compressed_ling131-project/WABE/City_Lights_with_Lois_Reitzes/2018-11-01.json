officials say they're starting to get a better handle on damages from Hurricane Florence and say there are substantial submitted damages from the storm and our poaching Seventeen billion dollars that's a big increase\nAnd one of the interesting moves that that universal film made is depriving the monster of his voice why I don't understand that\nIt's it's a good question I think there are a number of potential answers one thing that I bring out in the book is sound is quite new and film when this film is being made to being made in Nineteen thirty one sound really only became\nCommonplace in American films between Nineteen twenty seven in Nineteen twenty nine so you're talking about filmmakers who really learned\nA powerful range of tools\nBut I think it shifts the monster into a more childlike or more animal mode and I think that that makes him in some ways both more sympathetic\nBecause he can't voice all of the things he's experiencing it makes them more sympathetic\nBut in some ways it also makes them more monstrous\nAnd is that what Hollywood for what James Whale who directed the Nineteen thirty one version was aiming for do you think it was you know the thrills that a Hollywood was looking to get out of the audience\nIt's definitely a horror picture and there are lots of ways to read the book and lots of ways to make the film and there is a way in which the creature and the novel is almost a Hannibal Lecter kind of figure he's\nExtremely intelligent he is a manipulator he frames people he commits crimes and shifts the blame is a much more malevolent\nKind of a villain this can be a thriller we've seen people make movies that are comedies we've seen people make movies that are psychological thrillers out of this book James Whale is making a very particular kind of horror film\nAnd yeah I think that that there is a a dread that's created by that mute hulking monster interestingly\nCar law went to the great silent actor Lon Chaney this\nBoris ... who played the moments\nRight and and he went to Cheney specifically because Cheney was the most famous one of the most famous actress of his day and well known for playing monsters and Carla realized he had no lines\nIn the script and nothing to say and he went to Cheney to to figure out how to play this part and there's a way in which car last performance in Frankenstein in Nineteen thirty one is one of the last great performances of the silent era\nBecause Carl off gets tremendous mileage out of this character through very subtle gestures\nHe's their express [noise]\nUm I watched the Nineteen thirty one film in preparation for this interview and\nUm I was struck by the range of a motion and he was able to convey without any lines but without some of this deal that aspect of what we associate with silent film performance is\nIt creates a feeling of a sympathy yes and he said uh some compassion which actually are actually using the book too but his express more intellectually\nBecause in the book is that he said the monster talks and talks and talks about how bad where he was treated as a child it's all correct his father did abandon them but the Carlos performance is much more visceral\nFrankenstein Catherine Ross knickers sit in one of the contributors in your anthology she makes a point in her essay\nThat the monster is fundamentally a moral creature what capabilities does he have any acquires them instantly with life\nHe has a terrific intellectual abilities you can read and express them so very eloquent we which by the way to me again or underlines how amazing it was it in a two year old girl could put this kind of dialogue and this kind of description in her book\nHe wants to read he wants to learn and best of all and the most moral part as he wants to be accepted by humanity\nSo there are some really sad sees re tries to make friends with the regular people for a gay really they are both in the movie and in the book does that particular thing comes through in all the adaptations\nAre they accept him up to a point and then when they see that he's physically ugly all bets are off the ball game is over\nAnd when my ...

asserting that essentially\nWomen are people and the moment at which all of this is happening in Britain is the same period of time where we're seeing the birth of the abolition movement to ... and the African slave trade and there are all kinds of people\nAt the time that Mary Shelley as writing this book they're all kinds of people who weren't treated like people who are constituted or understood as as being devoid of whether it's because they're right because of their race or because of their religion or because of their gender and part of\nThe argument\nOf the novel it's it's a deeply humanist argument what the the creature is saying is by being aware\nBy being a conscious being\nI have certain rights I have certain qualities that have to be respected and that's an idea that it's not just impressive coming from a teenager which is certainly true that is a radical notion\nIn the early Nineteen century that that all human beings\nHave sort of some innate quality that is morally and ethically to be respected by all their fellow base\nYou know and that that actually shows up in reality because the fact that always fascinated me is that the\nThe English band slavery decades before the U.S that they were really on the ball ... about that and another point does the word monster has become attached to the creature that Dr Frankenstein made been actually Shelley's husband Percy\nWhoever it was a poet and knew how to choose words never called that that creature a monster recalled them being\nAnd that's really a nice neutral word he could have gone in any

Cohen she joined us last friday from the studios of NPR West to talk about this story\nWell you know low as about twenty five years ago I woke up after being engaged to play the green piano concerto myself\nAnd I thought wow this was the piece that my mother always told me about when she was a little girl growing up in Vienna the dream that she had to become a concert pianist and make her debut in that piece [noise]\n\nMaybe I could write a book [noise]\nMaybe I could find a way to tell her story if I could bring it especially the young people\nBecause I felt that the messages and the story very much because my mother held on to music and the darkest times and went after a dream a despite so many obstacles and challenges I felt that those messages would really really inspiring impact\nMy readers the audience is uh if I could ever get it out there and so I Am an example and I tell this to young people now when I bring the story\nOf someone who never gave up on a dream and it was it wasn't easy and I I went through rejections and lots of stuff along the way and finally I got a book published called the children of closed in line and so to speak the rest was history for me I got it launched\nAnd I'm so many wonderful educational foundations believed in the power of it\nOn the Milken Family Foundation facing history and ourselves and they helped me to grow and an educational initiative built around the book and the performances\nUm then my path crossed about I Would say about eight years ago with a phenomenal artist by the name of her she felt her he fell in love with the story and he took a chance on me he said let's see if we can adapt this for a one woman a theatrical production\nSo I plunged in really not knowing much about at all about the theatrical world I mean after all my background was a concert pianist\nBut I had a fire in my heart to want to do it and I studied he took a chance on me he got me an audition at the gas and play house we open the show a called the pianist of rules didn't land based on the book\nAnd it was was wonderfully received when we went month after month after month and then he started touring me and the last set of years he's brought me really across America and recently to London and two shows to a um theatrical run to the St James theater\nAnd um\n[noise] along the way I kept growing my educational mission because I felt\nIt was so important to try to ... in large the audience is too young young students and so we've grown that into what we call the wheels didn't read where ... through the foundation we gift copies of the books to school districts\nAnd then we do unabridged version of the show and a large theater I'm\nJust in a few days now here in Los Angeles I'm going to be bringing the Wilson read to twelve thousand students at the door the channel to Brazilian in Los Angeles just came from\nPortland where thousands have been reading it and then I'll make my way to Pittsburgh were nearly I think Seventeen thousand students are reading the book right now and we'll experienced uh experience the show so when my past crossed with ambassador steward Eisen staffed\nWho saw the performance in Washington DC about half a year ago on behalf of the defiant requiem foundation\nKey I saw the power of the story and the potential and then he came to see my performance is again recently the Kennedy Center where we did the theatrical run\nAnd he bestowed upon me the great honor to come to Atlanta and bring this performance ah to the to this year's Stuart ... lecture yes now the story\nIs based upon your mother is\nHow ... how do we say your mother was one of those children in the ... transport the children's trains that uh were supported by British charities that move thousands of European children to safety in England\nThat was a mixed blessing they can to transport\nWhat was the impact Tom family sending children way right very powerful question as you can imagine I often ask myself what was my grandmother feeling that day when she put my mother on the train\nAnd said goodbye to her and actually that particular scene at the train station which my mother told me about over and over when I was a little child is the number one reason why why I set up to tell the story and want to share it with the world [noise]\nMy mother would put me to sleep at night or sometimes in the piano lessons when she taught me and she would tell me how her mother\nAt the best one ... train station took her face in our hands and begged her to keep a promise which was to hold on to your music and I'll be with you every step of the way through the music\nAnd my mother you know it just didn't want her mother to see that she was crying but she made a vow that she would hold onto that music and that her mother would be there with her so that the age of fourteen she was put on that train and I often wonder what did my mother feel as the train sped away\nAnd the story then becomes what happened to her when she arrives in England along with these other ten thousand Jewish children who are all scattered to hostile to homes to farms different parts of England\nAnd my mother begins this incredible journey or that actually takes or near ...\nA into a place called peacock manner where she was put to work she worked as a seamstress\nAnd at nighttime she would sneak down to the parlor where the piano was and she wasn't allowed to play the piano so she played above the keys and imagined that her mother and father were listening to her and her sisters and it's a very pivotal moment in the story because even though she's safe and has plenty to eat\nShe thinks to herself as the music fills her up this was not why they chose her\nBecause to go back in the story my grandfather was only able to procure one ticket\nAnd the family had three daughters so\nThe decision of who they were going to choose\nWas so excruciating [noise]\nAnd they chose my mother and she would often tell me because they felt that the music would give her the strength to survive\nHow does this story move from\nPage to stay\nIf you're lucky enough you meet someone like her she felt her\nWho takes a chance on you and has the genius to um combined music music and storytelling when I met him\nI had a little prototype because the book could come out\nAnd the publishing house with semi around the country to do book signings and different things and they felt that the power would also be through the music so sometimes they would roll a spin it into the bookstore um and I would do a little you know taste of it\nSo I had kind of a of model of what I wanted to do but I had no clue of how you would bring it to the theater\nAnd it was my lucky day when it crossed with a missing comfortable artist\nWho then took the embryo so to speak and gave birth to the baby he designed an extraordinary set of um incredible golden frames ... through which he projected a world lost\nA the Europe that we know that his last and the kennel sat on the frame and then there was a broken frame around the entire\nStage to again represent a world that has gone from a he designed incredible lighting he grew the stage
