then we come up to the ... which for me is the heart of the whole peaceful and I've played this piece for for many years uh and but just recently in preparing this particular performance\nA realized something about this ... which I never had before and I absolutely believe that I write although I've never heard anyone else think about it or read I actually went and looked around as much as I could see if anybody else had this idea\nBut it's a I think that this low movement is actually a ... and that it's probably based on the great by Chicago first of all the violence in the same key or the ... has a little impulse on two on the second beat of three and it's a theme and variations\nToo well I did not know the insight to and I'm not sure I extracted [laughter] we do have a bit of this

thirty or warm bat no I'm Jessica ... fish is a monumental work Beethoven string quartet didn't beat flatter opus one thirty\nWhy is this piece extraordinary even\nFor ... ...\nI think it's um it's the opposite of the Archduke it's the struggle of Beethoven himself and he is kind of trying to um get an answer between where words cannot express and they're also music cannot even express sometimes\nSo there's a lot of inner struggle into it\nIndeed it is um some times Roche sounding the smear I'm at ... ... we're going to hear a bit of the beginning\n\nOh can't guy we just had that

the second and\nThird and fourth there we usually kind of think of them as a unit kind of we you know try to go through them as one unit and then with the ... of the piece the ... the fifth movement\nAnd then every single moving is so so different you know and then the second woman in the press though it's so short but it's so I'm just so striking and then the third movement the mood is so different\nWhen we were her scene where like let's try to talk about what is the kind of test this movement like oh it's kind of all year long has a dog is like oh it's kind of go I'm walking a dog

with Carole Walker shortly after the highest\nAcquired jubilant monitors in twenty Seventeen we talked about fact work starting with its title\nI think um\nI have a tendency towards long titles that are kind of over shoot point a little bit but I'm always looking for something that's more poetic than dogmatic and in this case I Am because I was concentrating on Stone Mountain or some of the ideas around Stone Mountain I\nI really felt that it needed to be to express a kind of enthusiasm that went into the creation of of a monumental carving [noise]\nFor people unfamiliar with your work you use ... and the jubilant martyr shows about a dozen scenes would you please describe some of them\nWell it is a cut from a large sheets of black paper\nAnd I and I began with a kind of a riff on on the um three horse men who appear in on an Stone Mountain car on the side Jefferson Davis and and Robert ... they're not true or\nOr well studied portraits are portrayals of the men on horseback but I I did find it very curious that one of the attributes of the carbon on Stone Mountain as a sort of unfinished and the horses have legs and and they appear to be sort of disappearing or\nBeing swallowed up by the mountain or by water some unseen force\nSo there's a some central horse figures as a figure that is being hung but there are figures that have [noise]\nGross stereotypical sort of negroes features so called and\nUh there are figures that are meant to conjure up a kind of the ideal of the lost cause the soldier with the broken sword monumental\nFigure on top of the heap of bodies I think one of the one of the um rifts one of the motifs or one of the jokes that's the sort of reporters in the work is uh\nSomething about horses and meals and so there are a couple of people in the pantomime horse you also\nHave been in the public eye there have been many conversations about your work and one quote that gets thrown around a lot from our critics is\nThat the work is that the recall showing the ridiculous ... wholesome depiction some the antebellum south\nIf that's what you would call it if that's what you do your hardest to call it what Charles here just stopped tier ...\n[noise] I mean sometimes find as a word but it's not exactly what I think that I'm doing in fact I think that I'm a I'm a an accidental satirist [laughter] there's the title of your autobiography\n[laughter] that you know I think at the young um\nWell a young artist or as a in graduate school and when I started thinking about what was\nImportant to me I also started thinking about I started to you about the limitations um that was presented to me as a black woman American artist um and some of those limitations have been you know handed down from generations of\nOppression and neglect and then some of it was also handed down by a generation or two of black arts movement you know sort of reclaiming of the of the creative space for people just like me so that in a funny way I'm really deviating from your question\n[laughter] anyway [laughter] I I've\nFelt as a painter print makers sort of compelled to go\nTo go in and go hard on the idea of reclaiming history and also questioning that history that must be reclaimed and somehow I had any sort of it's almost like two competing interests from outside of me battling for\nPrimacy is is this sort of like over arching\nSteps conceptual conceit of my work and then there's also me it was kind of like I don't really want to be in this fight [laughter]\nSo it's sort of like those are the three things
