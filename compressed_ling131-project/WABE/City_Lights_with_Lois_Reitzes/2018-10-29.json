Elizabeth\nUh but the idea was to always reaffirmed that this is the social order so this is actually a play about a register side this is someone who violates that and what happens to someone and of course of the country as well when someone does that\nAre so or Macbeth is encouraged by the supernatural or to move a little quickly uh toward his intend to destiny and he takes a short cut in whole chaos ensues [laughter]\nNow you have something which I think it is a wonderful um device if you will on your programs on your website\nWith each play with each production you talk about where it registers I'm the bard dominant or or do you say ... or ... ...\nYou know I uh I I Want to say it's probably a a a three or two\nI think so too so what does that mean perhaps for people who've never attended a play by shakes\nMeans it's an easy road or I Would say that it's simple to follow the story that you don't have to know a lot about Scott history to understand what's happening\nThat is reliable or or in this case probably most of the study that in high school [laughter]\nMatt this is the third time he has this protection that um this production with you in the lead in the title role has been staged at the Shakespeare Tavern\nHas your approach to the character evolved I'd have to say that\nAt the third year here or there is an interesting phenomenon where where'd that first year at the gate and you're so imbedded in the homework your your your dissecting the text and wandering around the parking lot until three AM and really soaking it all in and aggressively\nTackling that and at this point after three years so much of it so much of that homework as in the bones\nThat there's this lovely phenomenon where you can go out on stage really feel the energy in the audience on any particular given day\nAnd just experience the world of the play without having to have a very active you know ... percent of the driver's seat of your own mind trying to\nActively participate in make conscious choices it's almost a subconscious experience ah everything kind of lets you just feel that you're feeling and the given moment and and and experience at a very\nVibrant land actively and that's that's fun at least to some unexpected treats\nIt's a joy to watch too I have to say that it\nWill tell us what the choice of that world well\nIt's a very articulate we put descent into madness over a course of\nTwo hours in Fifteen minutes I mean the the the track that Shakespeare lays this person to go through and and then the ... the mental little loop de loops in hopes this it's it's an obstacle course for the soul and to have\nThat dissent 'cause it's in some ways I think a study on evil and what makes a human being become such a monster 'cause there there's a superficial out into the guy the monsters and to have it\nSo many delicious scrounge just words to chart the ... the mental degradation from from this person and being promised of the world\nAnd being promised him more time with the almost ... an impervious to danger and that that and have that in his relationship with his wife and how how that can create such an entity of evil\nI Love your metaphor about on coal course for the fantastic well let's let's talk about how that relationship how would you describe the relationship of Mac bath with lady Mac that well I\nI think in ... as I cast of our company we've we've gotten at a sort of embedded in our thinking that they have one of the best relationships in all of Shakespeare and I I think what Danny and I had a daddy heard the young lady who plays lady might be\nA we we've been able to find how the relationship changes over the course of the show and and how it how almost there's if you pay attention to how they communicate with one another\nHe says a very little to her they don't really have many philosophical debates on the morality of of doing these things it's it's there's a pressure there and\nSeeing how that relationship kind of degrades over the course of the show that can not only contribute to make these mental degradation but also heard descent into madness because I don't want to give her any spoilers or anything of several hundred year old boy but they still turn out very well for her either a\nAnd a ride around that climactic focal point to the end of act to when we have the banquet scene and we've already established that we're supposed to put on a brave face big smiles everybody we're supposed to be entertaining our friends and\nDisguising the bell would have to make our faces wizards of our hearts disguising what they are getting\nThe little bits of almost passive aggressive ah\nThat mental tug of war and how we relate to the world around us and how we\nMental crisis it's been fascinating\nBut they're finding those little moments back and forth about the rich kid the say opens with the ... and then what follows is the lead hacking and slashed shame his weight and making that process the come true\nWhat is the role of the supernatural ...\nWell the the which is ... they're called the weird\nSisters now that W. E. Y. A. R. D. yeah as opposed to weird which is what how it generally gets translated and ultimately it has evolved in our culture to be the arc typical\nWhich is with the pointy hats and and and the cauldron all of that symbolic edgy kind of can trace its DNA back to this play\nA but in the actual play or they go back to North mythology which is a\nA I guess the most terrifying thing ... you know warrior would ever face would be wounded and disabled on the field of battle after his friends have left\nAnd he would be confronted with the scavengers on the field of battle which tended to be known as the weird sisters and they took on a mythological a stance there because they were the people who would terminate the lives of the wounded warriors so that they could pillage the bodies and\nIt's hardly ... why are they women why do I feel like well\nThere is a there is a patriarchy and their ... their and their original sin and all that stuff to get out layers into that and and that is not necessary and actually this play does not exemplify the best of our culture\nAny way shape or form however\nThat's the root of it and also you see it in the Monty Python which is that you know cutting the thread and they tend to be old and haggard it's we know that men play these parts for Shakespeare and\nIn our play we have three women are two of them are actually just three lovely women and they uh uh they play other parts as well they played men parts and they they they and they play the women but there is a a femininity that might not have been in Shakespeare's\nA a a original and they are and there is well you know we kind of camp it up with a cap it up and say it's flashy you know we have elected a tree Shakespeare Hugo pageantry that's the way\nThat we've we have electric lights and our theaters and week course we take the audience with us with that and there's fog affects and we have puppets which uh I had a phenomenal puppeteer for for several years and uh it's um\nIt's it's it's a lot of fun with the witches but what they do is they advance the course of the action by by but might have actually been Macbeth true destiny to became they say hey you're going to be this and then he starts taking shortcuts and that's where it all goes haywire\nIt's unfortunately not surprising to me because these are the people that that white nationalist believe are working hard to undermine our country through bringing immigrants through a hoping to bring more refugees to the country and through trying to empower people of color in the country so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Lights with Lois Reitzes", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "29"}
