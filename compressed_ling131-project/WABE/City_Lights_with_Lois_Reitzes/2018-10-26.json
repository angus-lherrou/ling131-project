[laughter] really good [laughter] I'm they speak the truth [laughter] but you set out to be an actress I did yeah and you do\nPerform when the situation is right like this one quick to like to cook while you're acting\n[laughter] it's terrifying [laughter]\nI think it's going to be a lot of fun ah the closer we get to the actual performance but uh\nAnd I was just saying to Rachel yesterday actually the more cooking and chopping I can do while I'm Talking on the more comfortable I feel so I have I think it's going to be a great experience but it's definitely a daunting one to think about\nI Would sing the logistics would be very challenging I mean ... I have\nNo doubt you are very focused on your preparation and the ... all your ingredients in here and you're not only having this big book you're speaking through another character\nAbsolutely worried about the experience for just a second though is is that you know I don't think we said this is that she Jenny is alone on stage it's a one woman show and she is standing at a kitchen counter and she is making at the ... do\nWell on you as sauce and homemade pasta throughout the play 'em and there are just a few tables on the stage as well and those people get served the food that she's making it truly is an experience and when we were having the conversation yesterday I said well do you want the garlic pre peeled\nDo you want a little garlic press and she looked at me and said no no I'll chop [laughter]\nIf you're on my [laughter] but I don't know how to\nMake fresh pasta yet so uh I've enlisted my other chef friends this week to start that process you know the old fashioned way by hand\nRachel this seems much fun and yet not easy to do well\nHow do you approach this at this stage director out there and half of getting if she wants her garlic you\nSo true to its name friends is actually an art exhibit on the fence can you sort of talk about the thinking behind a putting work up in a park like this well it's a\nPerfect way to show photography where people can have the experience of encountering these images in the course of their daily lives and oftentimes when you're not expecting a this is an art exhibit it that's when it can make the biggest impression on you because you may be\nUm you maybe in a place where certain images will speak to you or you have time to read\nUh the captions and understand the projects or we find that the case a lot of people come to us and say\nI have really strong feelings about this and I just happened upon it you know while I was out walking my dog or out for a jog so um it's really a perfect way to accept that public art and you don't need a lot of infrastructure or special\nEquipment to show something like this\nYeah this is a it looks like a vital better I'm just a touch to chain link fence ... really simple um with with that sort of reaction from people in mind can you walk me through how you go about cure eating the work that goes up on the fence\nSo this is a really big international exhibit and there is a jury panel of about forty sort of industry experts I Would say\nThat ah all work together to select the images that go on the fence there's an open call for ... trees so anyone can apply and people apply from all over the world\nI think they had over two thousand entries this year the concept is that you tell a story and six images are less and the images need to have a consistency and an interesting scene and they need to be consistent and\nGreat at telling the story so we uh we jury them down to in this case forty one because\nWe have one of our photographers here what's what's bring you in\n... I'm One of the photographers on the fence and this is my um series part of the series animals' lives revisited\nAnd they're composites where I've taken a picture of the animal as well as the background and then sometimes I add other elements to it as well but then I add texture so it's more of a pay truly quality\nI used to paint and I guess it comes from that factor\nThe one I'm immediately drawn to this is a towel with the um with the tornado in the background can you tell me about this image\nWell I took the background picture in Illinois and I just happened to be driving by when it was like a severe storms the tornado was not there okay I made the tornado [laughter] but I think that the cows attitude is like\nA ... perhaps [laughter]\nBut it's a seeking shelter from the storm you actually you know he needs a little help there [noise]\nYeah the cows local here Georgia okay and sometimes I use real animals and sometimes I use taxidermy animals 'cause the Fox is taxidermy I've had several people ask me how did you get that he's still I said he was very still [laughter]\nThe detail in your work um and as you said the sort of textural imagery that you're that you're using can you talk about seeing in this particular medium like printed onto vinyl it on the phone\nSo I think it looks great because I have\nActually printed the some of these on canvas the glass form on campus because they do kind of lean towards a painfully quality so the canvas you know\nJust as another layer of texture\nAnd okay so as a as a returning participant of Atlanta celebrate your talks we can talk about what um what the organization does for photographers like yourself\nWell it gives them a platform in it um exposes you to a lot of other photographers which is often inspiration for yourself gives you the chance to hear people talk to have a lot of speakers during the um month almost two months this time [laughter]\nAnd it's a lot to look forward to I mean not just photographers too I think anybody interested in art\nWhich should be everybody\n[laughter] and I mean your your work is also you're being shelled alongside as as you mentioned an international grave artists\nRight we actually have three artists from Georgia featured on the fence this year and that's just an incredible incredible feat a forty one artist from around the world and we have three from Georgia for the first time ever so we've been uh exhibiting defense project\nFor I think this is our fifth year now and we've really been pushing photographers to apply a this has exhibited in eight cities around the country actually seven cities around the country and Calgary [laughter]\nSo uh it's uh it's seen by millions and millions of people and it's great exposure and we're just so pleased that bringing it here we hope has nurtured photographers into getting that kind of exposure\nWe are based in Atlanta and send our name so we feel the sort of booster is quality of promoting local photographers and providing a platform for them but uh in addition to bringing\nFeature speakers in and bringing artist in to a ... for the Atlanta audience we also feel it's important to promote Atlanta Georgia artist to the world and this is a\nWe feel like indirectly uh a result of that having these are ... and it all over the world while so part of an international consortium of photo festivals ah\nFifteen member festivals around the world and we talk to each other and do cross programming and that's another way to raise awareness of our local talent here in places outside of Atlanta\nNo along the along the southern hundred foot stretches sense there's a lot of really interesting images lot of really great colors but\nThe sort of lack of of color I'm over here get negative space to sort of drawing lights on and tell me about the work of a new show\nSo these this this series is a done by an artist who spends a lot of time in Africa and I was thinking about the fact that the landscape is changing over there so much and people keep them encroaching on the habitat of and these animals yet everyone has this collective sense of loving\nThese animals are part of our a sort of our human\nLexicon in a way these animals from Africa there are so iconic yet we continue to encroach upon them and endanger them so this artist is exploring that\nIdeas and came up with this concept of\nSort of making the landscape vanish so that the animals are isolated and we get to kind of experience them on their own in this dream like state because the the artist is always dreaming of them being safe and not in danger so it's it's\nA metaphor for the concept of the artist has really beautiful\nWhat'd you call this a gallery except for\nKind of a gallery exhibit because it's shown in cities uh it's really we've we talk about it like a traveling exhibition and if you look\nThat way is the largest traveling exhibition of photography in the world and we're so proud to have it here um we're we're near another Georgia artist project who couldn't be here today Daniel Edwards a project called black outlined blue and I think it's really important project\nA it was featured in New York Times and uh Daniels in Africa\nAmerican photographer whose parents are police officers and so he was struggling with\nHow to feel about law enforcement and how to feel about being black in how to reconcile\nThose two things and so this is a photographic exploration of those thoughts where he's photographed police officers in uniform and\nPut those pictures next to the police officers and they're playing in the street clothes and so you can see them as officers and as civilians and\nThink about what goes on in their mind these are just people and they're here to serve and so he's exploring that uh the photography it's a great project\nYeah and it's really interesting that\nAt the same time as the photographers working on humanizing\nThe subjects the names of the of the photographs just list them by dads number that's really interesting\nThere are a lot of great projects here and it's worth spending time in coming back so if you have a dog\nCome hang out and what some great art while you're walking your dog\nThat had a great thing about the fence is that\nYou've got the time to actually look at each one whereas if it was in the gallery per se they may be a lot

then the way that the emotion that he did vote for me to sing it\nIs just as such despair and even hopelessness that can be found right in the midst of struggle and pain and hardship and you know\nThe imagery that we have of the people who fought\nAnd did everything that they could during the civil rights movement you know is one of strength and ... and certainly there are moments of despair in of hopelessness and so to be able to evoke that feeling you know that needs to be healed to\n'em so definitely we're on the other side of that but still there was this despair there was this is
