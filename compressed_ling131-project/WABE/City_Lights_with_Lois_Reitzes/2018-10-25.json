director to knock shake ... bold and joined us to talk about this show\nAnd we're going to revisit that conversation that\nMany places in Europe and France especially embrace chat after World War one and bike World War two jazz was properly acknowledged as America's greatest cultural export\nWhat a\nTiered should be a greater acceptance of African American musicians and creative as we now know wasn't entirely as welcoming as I said she didn't\nBut for the purposes of the story how does the European War time experience informed of\nWhat you've hit the nail on the head of the two guys who actually developed as the real club in that way up to ... or as war buddies during work\nTo state in Paris after the war and began singing together I'm starting in night clubs all over Paris and ended up with a place called the Mars club towards the end of their stay there and thought or\nAs you rightly pointed out it looks like there's no problem you know I'm a white guy Europe white guy were singing together everybody loves this I think this racism thing has blown up over [laughter] and so uh let's go back to Atlanta and start a jazz club in Nineteen fifty eight\nOh okay well\nNice try um but that's that's not the story that there is so much more to the plot to it and you will tell us more to say\nIn addition to or to your wonderful talent as an actor you are an experience director\nWanted you to you about taking on this play in particular I Love the fact\nThat I'm Susan booth are incredible artistic director she had the good sense to pair people from opposite sides of the world in terms of me and fill up I think that when so often a lot of play play rights are paired with directors that\nSounds like them think like them and I'm going to continue their um agenda and what's interesting about the pairing us fill up and I is that where you have two different generations with different genders of different races and different experience that I grew up in Africa\nAnd he he lived here in Atlanta Georgia so um\nWhat I bring to it I think is that I'm asking questions from an outsider's perspective and what was really exciting about this play is that\nUm there is a universal story of building the stream and I'm ultimately it's an American dream but I Love the um\nHow Jazz is that the the soundtrack of this story which is a quintessentially American story and all the conflict um and the cultural which as we can pull from the history of jazz and put it into the story\nUm it's something that is just beautiful challenging exciting and I get to sit in a master class witness to deploy to have you ever directed a play with music ... this is the first time and that was what was really appealing to me to was the music I'm you know I grew up\nPlaying the piano and clarinet\nBut um I mean the teen Tyrone Jackson and Philippe deploy these guys are geniuses and just being able to be in the room listen to them jamming figuring things out um tweaking songs it's just been a really exciting process\nAt its heart this is the story of two friends trying to live out their dreams how are these men and what keeps them fighting for what they want to our these men who what keeps them fighting full that's ... that's a\nGreat question because it's right at the heart of the play the the players are actually a ... of the ... their friendship the friendship that developed in\nIn Europe came to America and they want to do this thing together they want to create a utopia they want to create Camelot here in Atlanta with each other because they\nTheir friends they they understand each other weirdly and they sound great together that the camaraderie of singing together is a bond that it's hard to explain but it's also a absolutely\nBinding when you when you sing harmony with someone at it really can you look them in the new sing with them\nIt create some kind of odd synergy but you can't get in any other way so they're they're they're actually welded up the soul\nAnd the fact that the dream and that can waters into place that can last forever or the dream collapses is the heartbreak of the ... story\n[noise] fill up your talent\nExtend to several areas and is well known this talent to extend to compensation and tell us about the music you're up for next\nWell Tyrone Jackson wrote the most of the music and I wrote the lyrics are we collaborated on the song starting almost a year ago and Tyrone Jackson is a monster this guy is credible player he plays all over town and all over the country in fact\nAnd it's been a thrill for me to work with her 'cause she's a better player than anybody I've ever worked with before in the last seven hundred years I've been in show business\nIs just a a an unbelievable guy to work with and we both came out it from the perspective of fifties jazz especially cool school Miles Davis Gerry Mulligan those guys\nAnd he knew that music and when I said you know this should sound like coal trains green and blue you know that is a and I won't even finish the sentence and he would start playing it on the piano\n[noise] you know this brings to mind um\nWhy you went to the creative effort and toil I'm sure of providing original music for this play I mean why not just huge fifties jazz stamp darn\nWell that yeah and that was a consideration at first that we would just use the the group in the play is based a little bit there sound at least his base a little bit on ... and Ross who were actually came up tiny little bit later in the early sixties but there were a vocal trail that sounds kind of like what our guys show bike in the play [noise]\nBut uh [noise] part of their creative process in the play was that they wrote their own solved instead of what you know ... mostly did where they started off sing ... that they wrote lyrics to an anti raw started writing your own songs but um [noise]\nThat that's going to you know I think take awhile to to seep into the to the bloodstream of of the country and voters um as you know but I think over time it'll affect\nYou know how his story is written going forward um that's important um to me as a reporter and somebody who values the Fox and things are substrates so I think that's one thing that I'm you know I think will happen over time\nAnd rest what about you before we have to go you do to smack you spent well your team spent more than a year and a half working on this a hundred thousand documents what do you hope will come up to us before we go\n[noise] I I don't know that we hope for any particular outcome our goal is generally just to set the record straight I think Donald Trump\nOr last hope for something I'm sure you hope that people don't just read this and go okay thanks [noise] no I said you're absolutely right I think we hope that curious people will have some of the questions they've had about Donald Trump answered\nThat when he says he was never really scrutinize there's a public official until a couple of years ago and

cheese memoir by the same name and she got to a point in her life where she was trying to figure out what her path was because it didn't look like marriage and kids and all of the things she was sort of hoping for\nAnd she worked in publishing and she uh decided to start writing about her dating experiences and the fact that she always gives away something too soon to the men and it's cooking\n[laughter] and then she thought you know this isn't really a great story weaves together her Italian heritage and her love of cooking and her disastrous [laughter] and uh and then she ended up writing this really funny wonderful book that has now been adapted to apply\nWere you aware of the book be for the play\nI I was not to I uh met with the artistic director of the theater she told me about the play in about the woman so once I started researching Julia uh then I became aware of the book and which is I've ordered so I can also read that at the same time [laughter] to me you are famous is a chef\nA restaurant tour a cookbook author\nOf the love of the laptop I calm now [laughter] I'm going to hire you as my [laughter] in really good [laughter] I'm they speak the truth [laughter] but you set out to be an actress I did yeah and and you do\nPerform when the situation is right like this one what to like to cook while you're acting\n[laughter] it's terrifying [laughter]\nI think it's going to be a lot of fun ah the closer we get to the actual performance but uh\nAnd I was just saying to Rachel yesterday actually the more cooking and chopping I can do while I'm Talking on the more comfortable I feel so I have I think it's going to be a great experience but it's definitely a daunting one to think about\nI Would think the logistics would be very challenging I mean as a chef no doubt\nYou are very focused on your preparation and does and bling lawyering grief in here and you're not only having this big book you're speaking through another character\nAbsolutely worried about the experience for just a second lowest is that you know I don't think they said this is that she Jenny is alone on stage it's a one woman show and she is standing at a kitchen counter and she is making at the pasta\nBanyas sauce and homemade pasta throughout the play 'em and there are just a few tables on the stage as well and those people get served the food that she's making it truly is an experience and when we were having the conversation yesterday I said well do you want the garlic pre peeled\nDo you want a little garlic press and she looked at me and said no no I'll chop [laughter]\n[laughter] but I doubt\nHow to make fresh pasta yet so uh I've enlisted my other chef friends this week to start that process you know the old fashioned\nWay by hand Rachel this seems so much fun and yet not easy to do well how do you\nFashionable hair sort of like a a puppy make over probably make over and so these are the foreign after pictures I'm clearly they were taking a and then put us up together into one image but you get to see the before and after of the donkey haircuts and it's perfect for the dog park so we put this one first yeah [laughter]\nSo true to its name fence is actually an art exhibit on defense can you sort of talk about the thinking behind a putting work up in a park like this\nWell it's a perfect way to show photography where people can have the experience of encountering these images in the course of their daily lives and oftentimes when you're not expecting a this is an art exhibit it that's when it can make the biggest impression on you because you may be\nUm you may be in a place where certain images will speak to you or you have time to read\nUh the captions and understand the projects or we find that's the case a lot of people come to us and say I have really strong feelings about this and I just happened upon it you know while I was out walking my dog or out for a jog\nSo um it's really a perfect way to accept it public art and you don't need a lot of infrastructure special uh equipment to show something like this\nYeah this is a it looks like a final better I'm just attached to a chain link fence really simple um with with that sort of reaction from people in mind can you walk me through how you go about cure eating the work that goes up on the fence\nSo this is a really big international exhibit and there is a jury panel of about forty\nSort of industry experts I Would say that uh all work together to select the images that go on the fence there's an open call for entries so anyone can apply and people apply from all over the world\nI think they had over two thousand entries this year the concept is that you tell a story in six images are less and the images need to have a consistency and an interesting scene and they need to be consistent and\nGreat at telling the story so we uh we jury them down to in this case forty one because\nWe have one of our photographers here what's what's bring you in\n... I'm One of the photographers on the fence and this is my um series part of the series\nAnimals' lives revisited and they're composites where I've taken a picture of the animal as well as the background and then sometimes I add other elements to it as well but then I add texture so it's more of a pain truly quality\nI used to paint and I guess it comes from that factor\nThe one I'm immediately drawn to\nIf we can do with the um with the tornado in the background can you tell me about this image\nWell I took the background picture in Illinois and I just happened to be driving by when it was like a severe storms the tornado was not there okay alright I made the tornado [laughter] but I think that the cows attitude is like\nA craft [laughter] but it's a seeking shelter from the storm yes you know he needs a little help there [noise]\nYeah the cows local here Georgia okay and sometimes I use real animals and sometimes I use taxidermy animals 'cause the Fox is taxidermy I've had several people ask me how did you get that he's still I said he was very still [laughter]\nThe detail in your work um and as you said the sort of textural imagery that you're that you're using [noise] can you talk about seeing in this particular medium like printed onto vital it on the phone\nSo I think it looks great because I have actually printed the some of these on canvas people asked for him on campus because they do kind of lean towards a painter like quality so the canvas you know\nJust as another layer of texture\nOkay so as a as a returning participant of Atlanta celebrate your talk we can talk about what um what the organization does for photographers like yourself\nWell it gives them a platform and it um exposes you to a lot of other photographers which is often inspiration for yourself gives you the chance to hear people talk to have a lot of speakers during the um month almost two months this time [laughter]\nAnd it's a lot to look forward to I mean not just photographers too I think anybody interested in art\nWhich should be every body [laughter]\nAnd I mean your your work is also you're being shelled alongside as as you mentioned an international group of artists\nRight we actually have three artists from Georgia featured on the fence this year and that's just an incredible incredible feat a forty one artist from around the world and we have three from Georgia for the first time ever so we've been ah exhibiting the defense project\nFor I think this is our fifth year now and we've really been pushing photographers to apply a this has exhibited in eight cities around the country actually seven cities around the country and Calgary\nSo it's a it's seen by millions and millions of people and it's great exposure and we're just so pleased that bringing it here we hope has nurtured photographers into getting that kind of exposure\nWe are facing Atlanta it's in our name so we feel the sort of blue Suresh quality of promoting local photographers and providing a platform for them but uh in addition to bringing\nFeature speakers in and bringing artist in to a for the Atlanta audience we also feel it's important to promote it Lenin Georgia artist to the world and this is a we feel like indirectly uh a result of that\nHaving these artists beams and it all over the world well so part of an international consortium photo festivals a\nFifteen member festivals around the world and we talk to each other and do cross programming and that's another way to raise awareness of our local talent here in places outside of Atlanta\nNo along the along the southern hundred foot stretches sense there's a lot of really interesting images lot of really great colors but the sort of lack of of color I'm over here the negative space to sort of drawing attention tell me about the work of a new show\nSo these this this series is a done by an artist who spends a lot of time in Africa and was thinking about the fact that the landscape is changing over there so much and people keep them encroaching on the habitat of and these animals\nYet everyone has this collective sense of loving these animals are part of our\nA sort of our human lexicon in a way these animals from Africa there are so iconic yet we continue to encroach upon them and endanger them so this artist is exploring that\nIdeas and\nCame up with this concept of sort of making the landscape vanish so that the animals are isolated and we get to kind of experience them on their own in this dream like state because the the artist is always dreaming of them being safe and not in danger\nSo it's it's a metaphor for the concept that the artist has really beautiful\nWhat'd you call this the gallery exhibit\nIt's kind of a gallery exhibit because it's shown in its cities\nUh it's really we we talk about it like a traveling exhibition and if you look at it that way is the largest traveling exhibition of photography in the world\nAnd we're so proud to have it here um we're we're near another Georgia artist project who couldn't be here today Daniel Edwards a project called black outlined blue and I think it's a really important project\nI was featured in New York Times and uh Daniels an African American photographer whose parents are police officers and so he was struggling with\nHow to feel about law enforcement and how to feel about being black in how to reconcile those two things and so this is a photographic exploration of those thoughts where he's photographed police officers in uniform and\nPut those pictures next to the police officers in their planes you know the street clothes and so you can see them as officers and as civilians and\nThink about what goes on in their mind these are just people and they're here to serve and so he's exploring that uh the photography it's a great project\nYou know and it's really interesting that\nAt the same time as the photographers working on humanizing\nThe subjects the names of the of the photographs just list them by badge number that's really interesting\nThere are a lot of great projects here and it's worth spending time in coming back so if you have a dog\nHang out and look some great art while you're walking your dog yeah\nThat's a great thing about the fence is that\nYou've got the time to actually look at each one whereas if it was in a gallery per se they may be a lot of people and this when you can come back to for the next couple of months [laughter]\nActually you can come back to it through November first at lectures celebrates photography the fence is on view
