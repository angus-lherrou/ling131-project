... get a ... a surgeon who treated countless rape victims in this war torn country\nWell part of what's going on here is not just the fraud political environment but this one seat is so important that Justice Kennedy was our center vote and this really will install a conservative very conservative majority and the Supreme Court potentially for decades assuming no unexpected health developments for justice rather leave the court [noise]\nUm the other thing that I Would say is that ah it can be a little early to tell exactly what will get from judge Kavanaugh we should never make very solid productions but I Do think that the president got exactly what he was looking for in all likelihood and news and the people who voted for the president some of them holding their noses when they did it\nWanted exactly this and so the right in the country was deeply invested in this this is probably is higher priorities they can have\nAnd this was just said the Democrats really haven't really gotten how important the Supreme Court is maybe this will be the wakeup call for them or other people will say that actually has caused conservatives to really realize the stakes of having control of the Congress and so maybe they'll be motivated it it will be interesting to see how it\nPlays out you know a lot of people have compared this to what happened in Nineteen Ninety One with Clarence Thomas and of the sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill which you broke you covered how\nWell one thing that it's sort of interesting is that the Judiciary Committee then was dysfunctional because it was all male and didn't take her allegation seriously to begin with however it was more functional in a bipartisan way\nJoe Biden was in the chairman the Democrats actually controlled the Senate they actually kept Republicans in the loop pretty much about everything that went on\nA they didn't do they didn't send the FBI down to interview a Anita Hill without telling the Republicans what they had done\nAnd whenever they conducted an interview they did it jointly between majority and minority council they didn't do that this time now the Republicans say we offered yes as far as I can tell they did offer to let my the minority cancer participate but they got the offers usually a ten ten o'clock the night before\nSupport for WABC comes from leap frog celebrating Twenty years of

only eight and they could be tied um the justices tried very hard not to have those conflicts you can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to battle out out of a lot of if any cases because\nOf what he said well Tom Goldstein President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there a before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nCould he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well\nThe Clintons might be a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of\nThings involving liberals and conservatives then yes there's I think zero percent chance that he's going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the front issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage in the like I can see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and ask for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this era of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all Nina what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade but we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are\nAre popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against well\nI don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise at the right well who knows what that means you can fill into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation but there is a right to same sex marriage is a binary light switch on light switch off thing I can see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to\nIs all kinds of things that go with it like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them developed photographs of your same sex wedding\nAs Supreme Court is like a marriage of nine and they're not getting out of it for a maybe forever so they have to figure out a way to live and work with one another that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of bad feelings beneath the surface and worries about the court is an institution\nSo a couple of things you know several of them have been through very hard confirmations Justice Thomas justice ... to some extent justice Gorsuch the chief justice to some extent\nSo there's going to be some level of sympathy and empathy a because we've been there and we know how unfair it can be second they really care about the institution so without blaming anybody they're going to have hated what happened because the institution\nReally can only survive it has no army ... doesn't have any way to enforce its judgments as has often said to it relies on public trust in being a fair and neutral institution and it has been portrayed as not that\nAnd it's also as a consequence incredibly important that they individually BP's perceived that way and so when they give speeches when they go to meetings when they just talk to people they they try incredibly hard to make sure they're convenient impression\nAnd I don't think anybody thinks that that was the impression that was left by the final set of testimony by bright capital indeed you saw him right himself with some regret about that just given the special circumstances and stresses at the moment\nYeah what about that or an op ed in the wall Street Journal from a nominee for the Supreme Court and after he had given an interview to Fox News both news organizations owned by Rupert Murdoch but um\nWhat did you say I Would advise and that was not good placement that he should have put it in a liberal newspaper not ... not on a conservative editorial page he should have made sure that the readers of the Washington Post which is after all his who was looking\nAt at this today or the readers the Washington Post we're getting negative editorial and uh he should have had that it was not good placement at the very least\nHow well the other justices\nWelcome him a with a fairly open arms I think\nYou know they they do really recognize as Nina put it so well the incredible need to be college all they get three months off from each other during the summer to take a little bit of a break but despite all their disagreements they recognize they have to get along and that they are the only functioning branch of government practically\nAnd so I Would be very surprised if there was any overt\nOr indication to him that anybody was trouble now the chief justice has a very special role in administering institution\nThere may be some efforts you know to kind of increase public confidence in the place as a as a nonpartisan institution but I Would I Would be shocked if there were troubles inside the building that were over\nThat as time goes scene or the publisher of scotusblog we're going to

Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWe found in the last week is there are certainly\nSome Republicans coming out I'm probably had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least for a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week\nA lot of them felt number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford they just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting to it so it's a little far as the Republican Party at this and um I I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that way Trump doubled down and attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think cabinet eyes slowly I just think all hands are fairly leaving confirmed in the end um galvanize that are even more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today a talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital and some of them said to me\nI think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized\nWell I think the Dominican as of right it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are\nI Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just by Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the president that we're seeing right now it's conditional on this issue we've seen that happen over and over and over again where a Republican voters in Republican elected officials will join Trump's side", "show_name": "City Lights with Lois Reitzes", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "06"}
