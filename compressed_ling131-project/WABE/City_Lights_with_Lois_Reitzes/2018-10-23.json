which is quite interesting um but I was really struck by that statement I'm Jessica and I looked at together that said\nThat his photographs or simple statements of was simple statements of thoughts and feelings that he wanted to let the camera speak for him and said there's enough\nA lot of editorializing and his work um but I think that when you think about a photo of photographers voice you have to think about um\nThe roles that they get to play as the edit this is the author an editor so he makes a choice about what kinds of things he's going to document\nUm and I think particularly if you think about him leaving this and then going off um to Chicago and and photographing the riots I mean that's something\nQuite significant he's a freelancer who puts himself in the middle of that space\nIn order to document that I'm In a white freelancer right in the middle of of a lot of turmoil and upset\nUm in the south side and west sides of Chicago I'm In order to document that so I think that\nAnd he certainly saying something about poverty in some of those about dignity I'm about human equality and you see that over and over again and his photographs throughout the south as well as in um northern um industrial centers\nI've to the point you made about narrative and his choices very well taken because we can glean none of them are from the emotion he captures in these photos of the funeral but from looking\nAt his other work we certainly come in for that he was very sympathetic\nTell us a little about the title of the exhibition\nWhat's a quote from psalm thirty five\nUm cell weeping main door for a night\nUm this is the first part of the first part of the exhibition titled the parts that we left off is the part that says the joy comes in the morning\nI'm so far a lot of listeners that's probably going to be pretty familiar um and it also was I'm quoted often by Dr King in his speeches probably most notably in the I have a dream speech\nAs\nWe approach the\nFiftieth anniversary the observance of Dr King murder is has been so much that [noise] and so much of what we look back\nHas been the tragic that why is it important to relive this chapter the funeral\nIn particular\nYou ask just a moment ago about the title weeping main door for a night um the second part is that is left off but I Would say there's a way in which that can be posed as a rhetorical question it says what joy comes in the morning fifty years hands I think it's an important question to ask ourselves um\nHas the promise of that work them realize how might we reflect on that how might we consider um these moments five decades to go in and and use them as a lens through which to look at the experience that we're having right now I'm One of the things that we often say is that um\nHistory\nOut by studying history we understand what happened in the past and can use it then to frame where we are and the president but also to plan for the future\nAnd so what does all of this telling us about the present moment that we're in there about how we might plan for the future I think that those are critically important questions history is is very much alive um and that the kinds of things um that Dr King um was fighting for and ultimately died for\nUm human equality a peace I'm\nA full realization of civil and human rights for every body those are local and national and global questions today as much as they were then\nParticularly aren't Columbus point that history is very much alive in that fifty years seems like\nA large amount of time but when we\nThat these photos and we see the children and the photos and ... was wonderful like capturing these faces a these children we look at them and think\nThat little boy is fifty five year old man now I'm ... this

how this like I see what this means to them and and their lives what it meant at the time and and living in the fifty years past um has\nMeant and and and how it is formed them as people um and I
