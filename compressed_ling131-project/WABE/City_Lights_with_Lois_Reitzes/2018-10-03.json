into brain science and we're just convinced that that missing five ounces explained why they should uh pretty much call the shots\nI wasn't aware of that until I read that in your book and it occurred\nTo me maybe it's like exercise may be that missing five ounces is because women\nAre using their name or that all the body fat that the brain was exercise when what was left was just the essence of intellect and knowledge and I'm digressing\n[laughter] we have a very tone debris as you enter the our neurologically efficient yeah [laughter] well the the\nBook is crammed full of information and anecdotes and it's a lot of fun to look at\nThere are several charts and graphs and even a Venn diagram of intersection now ... whose idea was to present information why\nWell okay let me start by saying we knew we were going to have the book illustrated and we were going to work with this wonderful illustrator\nTyler setter but when you write a book for the first time you discover things about yourself I discovered I Can't think visually Kristen on the other hand realized\nShe really really thinks this really [laughter]\nYeah there we did not set out to a present as many and so graphics as we ended up\nUh doing but since the book is so all encompassing and because like you said these individual chapters about money bodies brains all of these could be their own books\nI found myself trying to distill these ideas that are really complex than layered in an easy to grasp kind of way because a lot of is still a lot of a lot of ...\nOr five of us about beauty and opens with the question how does patriarchy cosmetically didn't find the U.S and how do we reconcile feminism with pressures to conform to beauty stand\nAgain we could talk for several hours or ride a doctoral dissertation on this book would you boil it down for us would you explain what you are trying to achieve in this chapter\nSo in terms of looking at beauty through the lens of patriarchy\nAgain we want to figure out what is patriarchy telling us to do and why and how much [laughter] aim is that taking up in our lives\nBecause we are essentially told we have to look a certain way and if we don't we don't fit into the conversation we don't fit into the world and the right way and that's that is pretty heavy so\nBut there's also this tension but I think is always gonna permeated feminist circles in conversations even up to today that wants to\nCreate a litmus test for feminist of Kenya wear lipstick and be a feminist can you actually care about you know trying to emulate Kamkar dash in beauty aesthetic and be a feminist\nBecause of all of the patriarchal baggage that comes with women cause medically I'm kind of defining themselves\nAnd the fact of the matter is that the answer to those questions is yes because\nFeminism kind of has nothing to do really with whether you wear lipstick or not [laughter] but what we wanted to do was\nGive people the context of where those problematic areas are and beauty and what where those norms and expectations of how women ought to look like what where those come from and sort of the pressures they exert well also recognizing that a lot of people are included\nFind a lot of fun and self expression in beauty practices um and wearing makeup Caroline by the way is wearing a bold red lip it's a state of ... let's stick as all [laughter]\nVery little of fighting for like ... what topics like beauty especially there there's a tendency for us to see it as like something you can either have and be a feminist or not and it's like a purity test right right right\nAnd what we're offering is not a prescription of how you should live your life but rather again hopefully\nSome guidance for women to at least understand like why this beauty scenario exist to begin with\nAnd not have to feel the need to apologize right foreign drawing wearing lipstick or a um what would be considered traditionally feminine style clothes but\nThere are so many\nThings we post on our so this book under scores what a mess it is just to sort through all of the various identity to ease and issues women have to grapple I mean\nYou don't think about ... see a little girl\nYou know she doesn't know right that she is not supposed to be certain things be interested in certain things and yet you cite research that I'm says as early as six years old ...\nYou'll be talking with her alongside of in the Adams about their new book\nAs women who've been studying feminism for years ... work and the wave of hate that followed it affects your approach to what you do\nYes in the sense that the\nOnline threats and attacks that are still ongoing to this day she gets death threats every day on line\nUm demonstrated\nIn one way just how real the need is for the kind of information that that Caroline and I are hopefully offering through and ladylike to validate that those kinds of\nTo validate it that kind of massage any Israel and it's not just on line and they aren't just you know bullies in a basement on the Internet um but that it's a symptom of something a lot bigger and it has a lot of different manifestations some of which seem totally benign you know\nBut the fact that need us our cheesy and needs\nA bodyguard for an event where we're going to talk about women from history is outrageous\nThis book is ... press you mentioned Luis C K enact three years ago could you ever have imagined that your completed volume would come out during the me too movement no no\nNo because we had no idea that we would be reading a book after Donald Trump was elected do you think\nThat\nIt has extra weight the causes me to or do you think you too is just one more example of what you've been talking about for a year\nI think me too is um\nAn indication of what you were asking us earlier about communication and women speaking out but more than that women being heard um and so what I'm hoping friend lady like is that it not only give some context perhaps for me too but it's also part of that wave of women speaking out and being heard\nYou probably have listeners and you will have readers\nWho don't know what color you are and one of the things that his best surely the wild on in this book on lady like is\nThe way that the book dresses the intersection of race and gender you are very comfortable blaming thing blaming things than using words like white folks [laughter]\nYeah tell us more [laughter] I think it's\nOur responsibility especially as a two white women born and raised in the south\nTo be extremely conscientious of how we present the realities of race um because also [noise]\nI mean obviously this issue is not just exclusive to the south but it's so much stereotypically identified with it and also the construct of lady could which restricted really the respectability of women to being of a certain class and obviously of\nThe white race and at the time after the civil war you have these early early fashion magazines I'm entitled culture magazines emerging for black women specifically addressing the lady her problem\nOf\nEncouraging them to dress in particular ways that could get around us actually like just the racist attitudes that people were walking around with 'em and they were part and parcel of the concept of being\nA lady and I think that that still ripples through feminism to even today\nRight and we knew as Christians that as to [noise]\nUm white straight women that um we\nWe ... we owe does your audience to to continue our dedication to presenting more than just our perspective to making sure that as a reader you don't come away with the idea that certain issues only affect certain people that we're all affected by\nSexism by these is I'm ... and ... yes sometimes it is worse if you are not white\nIt's difficult to uncover so much of what you have written about and and not\nFeel your temperature in your blood pressure how can you can deal with well\nI think one big thing is that we do know it'd be different if every literally every man around us was spewing hatred and vitriol and trying to literally and figuratively silence us but we do know that that's not true across the board obviously\nUm and I think one thing that has helped me maintain perspective is that so much of what we write about when we write about the patriarchy\nIs like\n... it just the air around us it's not necessarily that individuals are saying do this don't do this but it is more of like a social\nContext to a lot of our existence and so that\nI mean at the risk of making it sound even heavier um than it would be if it were just an individual person who you could you know yell at um I think that one thing that's nice to keep in mind is like this is like a collection of social attitudes and we can push back against that\nYeah because smashing the patriarchy\nIs not about smashing men\nUm and and ladylike is as much for men and boys as it is for women and non binary people because the crux of on lady like is a rejection specifically\nOf the ladies shaped box that women have been forced into over years\nUnder the system of patriarchy and women can be justice complicit in a reinforcing sexism and double standards and uh [noise] being cruel to other women just as much as men can so this isn't a takedown of\nMen but rather hopefully a guide for us to see just these systems and also the remnants of history that are still reincarnate throughout a our current time and that it's something that we all have a stake\nIn right and also that\nUm ladylike and feminism at large benefit everyone not just women not just the women who were reading this book but we all have something to gain in saying oh it doesn't have to be like this I thought it just was like that because you're a woman so you have to be this way and you're a man so you have\nTo be this way if we look at why these things these beliefs these construct exist then we can say oh\nAnother way to be the tips\nTo exist to interact to communicate and I can separate myself from those restrictive boxes whether it is a lady shaped box and you're expected to be proper or whether it is a macho man shaped box Caroline birth and Kristen konger\nCongratulations some on the lady luck and thank you very much for joining me thank you thank you so much\nOn lady like kissing stores

joined me in Studio to talk about why Hitchcock and flying now\nUh so I think that it's Hitchcock just remains his sons remain timeless examples of great filmmaking and I think why now I mean I I Would say we should always be looking at Hitchcock's phones\nAnd has to be discussed at the same time when when I first was becoming familiar with Hitchcock there was a line of arguments that argue that Hitchcock was the ...\nYou know look at what the women and his films such as ... and the birds is is undergoing Janet Leigh agenda leading up exactly and\nUm she part of what he addresses in his films this obsession I mean that's definition of vertigo I'm an neurosis the voyeurism and we're window you know which is a brilliant film because it\nStars all American Jimmy Stewart who we really like but this man is sick\nAnd I think it's a you know ... and I know I'm ... and for a moment just to say his use of actors whose casting of actors and is directing of actors\nContrary to this idea that he thought that role like cattle or he gets amazing performances from his actors but my larger point going back to your question is about\nIs Hitchcock massaging as perhaps on some level but he is also\nOne of the foremost filmmakers of his time who picks the vulnerability of women under patriarchy that if women are victims in his films it's because he sees them in a very traditional Victorian way is the most vulnerable members of society\nIt's not purely that but that element I think this is in an otherwise he could not make films that are so sympathetic to heroines like Rebecca like notorious like suspicion uh and and many others\nI think one of the cornerstone pieces of feminist down theories sort of what God that area of the field started a which is Loren movie's visual leisure and narrative cinema written and Nineteen Seventy three\nUses it essentially her the premise of her argument is is based on psychoanalysis I'm not going to go into that but it's essentially like the language of cinema is patriarch on that women Are Forever the objects of that cinema they're never in control of the gays they are always objects that the gays\nAnd she uses her to go anywhere window as her examples to other examples to illustrate that\nPoint and talking about for instance how the character of Lisa played by Grace Kelly and we're window is always is there to be looked at she's there to be seen\nAnd you know she works in the fashion industry and she's parading around in these gorgeous out sets\nBut there have been opposing perspectives on that argument which is sad but at least says the one who gets it done I mean she's the one who goes over and I kind of giving away parts of the year that she's the one who is actually moving getting things accomplished she's the one who goes over to the lord\nDepartment and so I think it's just important to keep these two perspectives in mind 'cause I think they're both\nValid I think they're both they you can certainly make a a very convincing argument on on both sides and this is one of the reasons why as a feminist film scholar um I find his work so fascinating and it's always fascinated me because there's just there's so much complexity and there's so many different ways you can approach that's\nOne of the overarching themes and Hitchcock films I mean you could say that's involved drama is power who has power and which characters have power over which couch how do they how do they manifest that you know and we're window Jeff has power because he spent spying on his neighbor once one neighbor is aware of him power shifts so on and so forth\nBut power is also his technique it's his power over the audience and in that very broad sense technique and theme are United and Hitchcock is a very classical filmmaker his best films which we're showing are very classically structured I mean Shakespearean structure\nUm everything fits in every decision he makes you know and we teach intro to film and we analyze a film with students will say do you think the director really thought of all this detail\nFor certain directors including Hitchcock the answer is yes\nHe thought of every detail every camera angle every bit of lighting I enjoy a board\nAnd all of his films shot by shot so\nSo would you say that Hitchcock was successful as a director of both entertainment as well as our\n... and you and I think in certain films he tends towards one side like vertigo for instance which is a math is already talked about that but he's definitely airing towards the arch Moore the artistic side there because that is I found that isn't classically constructed and to contrast that with\nRear window which I think I I always tell my students this is just a perfectly constructed found every thing visually narrative lead us introduced at the beginning gets resolved at the end sound even sound motif that got introduced at the beginning and the opening sequence get resolved at the end\nI mean in that case it's both art and entertainment but I think vertigo for instance as I found that was a not well received when it was first made because it was so far afield from just a classically constructed film I mean at the film operates\nOn yes this this idea of obsession and desire and it's very circular\nAs students have said it's like there's multiple movies and one and that is not ... and I think that's why people didn't respond to it very well initially but now it's become a little bit so that in a in the latest sight and sound pull of the best films ever made um it
