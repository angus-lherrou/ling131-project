first solo record it and it didn't twenty Seventeen when she released moderation nation\nEmily joined us the day the album came back to share her new music\nAnd tell us the idea behind the title well among ration\nIs a flock of starlings and I've always been drawn to birds I'm not sure why particularly blackbirds\nAnd I saw a video footage of him or Asian of starlings and they do all the shape shifting fluid movement in and out of each other no one really understands why and even if they think they do I still don't think we know\nBut they think baby it's to ward off pray but anyway it's this beautiful soaring togetherness of this flock I saw it as a metaphor but what's happening in this country as groups of people formed together in their communities and their movements without the higher Grammy\nAward winning folk artist Amy Ray began her start to fame with the Indigo Girls where she remains after taking it so low in two thousand one with her punk rock album stack\nShe's back with a new American feel\nAmy's newest album holler combines traditional country southern rock gospel an blue grass she tells the story itself honky tonk than being born in the middle of the civil rights movement\nAnd me his album all sir has guest appearances from the likes of dirt trucks from the Allman brothers band and skill\nAnd she's with us now live in Studio Amy Ray welcome back to city to lie is good to be here really is so and his new album is so exciting and I think what's interesting is that title is\nHoller [laughter] but you have such softness\nAt at noon every way which first tell us about um the north Georgia pirate Byron Hurt but\nReese who inspired one of your songs on the\nYeah well he was but I I'd first discovered in I live in up into long ago now first discovered is perjury um through a documentary that I saw that someone had made up there that I saw a little theatre up there the ... theater and then I went and\nRead as many points and books as I could and and just read about his life he he died rather young he was a farmer by by trade and a poet [noise]\nUm and he got free well known 'em but he ... he struggled with poverty and he committed suicide young just both his parents had died from TV and um but the thing that strikes me about him is just as poetry is is incredible it's some\nIt's classic you know and he he was also writing during a time when a lot of things are purging up about race and so there are also things in his short like books and and fixing that you wrote that was tackling some of those issues as well and\nAnd he was kind of a a I don't usually he spoke for the for the ones that couldn't speak um including nature including people that had no voice [noise]\nUm so it was a beautiful man and he just he inspired a song on this record but he inspired a lot of my writing after I started reading him 'cause I just um it gave me even more attachment to where I I live you know where I go home\nAnd stuff and part of that comes through resoundingly well much of that of the sense of place comes through responding late but what ... crashing about\nYour take on the country and living in the country is you're inclusive addict too\nI was hoping you would perform fine\nSo you know do we have a sense that there is any pushback to this idea that this is just another sign that the monarchy ain't what it used to be oh\nAbsolutely and they're always going to be the haters out there they're always going to be the haters do not read the comments on the daily mail on line it will break it is just horrible they're always going to be the haters\nReading the comments on any news website if you'd like to read it just don't do don't do it it will ruin\nYour faith in humanity so yeah I mean I I just think

I bought the broad would have been\nA cause for great hilarity ... among his audience is\nUm but I didn't want to do that speech in a way that didn't honor Shakespeare's attention or to say that she she doesn't mean it says to the seventies and eighties um during the women's movement there was a lot of sort of doing this production\nA in a way that had Kate sort of wink at the audience like I don't really mean this or that sort of thing and I don't think that's true I think she does\nAnd so um the the rest of the resident company kind of gave me no choice but to direct it they're like for going to do it nobody else wants to represent the artistic director you win or lose as [laughter] so I had to spend a lot of time thinking about how can\nI uh get Kate to submit to ...\nUm but have her ah have agency and have her do it willingly and be something that she wants to do as opposed to something she's forced to do or broken\n[laughter] I've never been five with\nWhat they think they're supposed to solve [noise]\nHey Mr famous Langston from real if you\nI didn't catch it the wrong time did I ... character cash 'em no small irony for the nickname they're either even though his name is cash is she's she's somewhat conflicted about the white for\nA at first yes yeah for a second I I think he is someone who is looking for a way to feel like his life matters and him discovering this power\nDid she write songs about revolution ... starting out way back with the coup you\nAre proud to be an activist yet\nAnd it's a\nParent in the movie that you have a very new launch take\nOn the idea of revolution and protest cash isn't going up against politicians he's up against a corporation and\nYes the artists are not entirely blameless they're very complex ideas which he talked about translating\nWhat I was trying to get across with all of my work\nIs the idea that there are some basic idea is that we all can agree on we all I think most people would agree\nThat we should have a world where we have some say in what's happening around us right and so then you get into the nitty gritty of that like who does have the say over what's happening around us and what is the economic system that allows them to have more say than us and so then\nBeing an artist for instance someone who's\nTried to talk about these things I also realize that so much of the left hides in academia an art as a way to be able to have a regular day and decide that they're doing the right thing I'm One of those people these critique surround\nThat that are that are in the movie around are to me also talking to myself there's a ... a union organizer\nThere are played by Stephen ... from these people know him from Walking Dead and stuff and uh\nThen there's a Tessa Thompson plays the artists and they have a conversation where um she has an artist and saying look I'm doing the same thing you are and he's like notes\nNothing like what I'm doing and that that's the conversation I'm always having like what what am I doing that's materially changing\nPeople's lives and and and so why it's nuanced in the film is because my view is pretty clear that\nWhat we're looking for when we talk about social justice when we talk about fighting racism at the core\nWhat we're talking about this us having control over the world around us and the key to that has to do with us having control over our work but if you're not connecting what you do to the struggle that has to happen if you're not actually\nUsing your art in conjunction with the movements that are doing the thing you know has to happen then you then\nYou're just putting it off and you're you're you know um so\nI remember you know a couple of times um people saying while I was very influenced by your work that's why I'm an artist that's the wrong thing that I'm teaching people then\nBut I have also had people saying I'm very influenced by your work that's why I'm an organizer [noise]\nRiley wrote and directed the film [noise] sorry to bother you which is available now on I too am doubt they're digital format [noise]\nBoots Riley speaking about the relationship between art and activism something we find ourselves talking about quite a bit on city lights [noise] Hi I'm Lois rights is here with you and Scott Stewart\nAnd we hope that if you have not yet donated to W.
