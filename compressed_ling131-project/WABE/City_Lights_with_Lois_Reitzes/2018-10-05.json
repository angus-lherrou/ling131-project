B. E. we're back with\nW. H. B. E. city like St Louis rights is revisiting a conversation I had with the author ... McLean on her latest novel love and ruin\nWhich delves since the life of writer and war course bombed and Martha Galvis horn also known as Ernest Hemingway third why\nWhat's interesting to me is that the very beginning they were only allies and supporters of each other's work they fall in love and Madrid and Hemingway as well as being her mentor\nUm look teaching her all about sort of the nature of war and how to survive in this besieged city was also encouraging her work when she went over there she didn't really know she wanted to be there and be a witness but she didn't really know what she would write about it\nOr to whom she would send that she had no\nAs I said no credentials no formal post there\nAs a journalist and that she watched what was happening in Madrid she became more and more drawn to the stories of ordinary people\nAnd well Hemingway and his fellow mostly male journalists were off in the trenches reporting on adult statistics and tactics and\nArtillery and all of those things she was doing something that actually never had happened in journalism before which was paying attention to the ordinary stories of the people there whose lives are being ripped apart by war\nThe women waiting in lines for all day for ... or that children who are walking to school to the streets through trails of blood and and this was what she was drawn to and she began to write about that Ernest encouraged her to send her first piece to call your magazine\nWhere she had the fake letter from and they took it immediately and then they took another and suddenly she was on the mast head and very quickly within six months\nShe went to you know from being a war tourist or a fraud as a correspondent to being one of the most important voices coming from this war and and it really did she changed the face of journalism\nAnd although at the beginning he admired her courage and her independence and is her spirit and her and her all of this her bravery in and her writing\nWhen Spain fell and they both went to Cuba to begin writing their books\nThan they can to be at odds you know his work took everything over and she was struggling he was working on for whom the bell tolls which would become his in Spanish civil war masterpiece\nAnd sell more books in that day when it was published in Nineteen forty than any other book and history save gone with the wind [laughter] and she of course was struggling to write a novel to that almost disappeared the moment\nThat it you know hit the shelves [noise]\nNo matter what else happened covering for work earnest and treated and this awful marvelous war were tangled up inside me like the story of my life I wouldn't keep them I couldn't but they were mine\nAfter spraying Gail horn spent the better part of the year traveling through Europe and writing\nMore pieces for college hurts you mentioned a moment ago that she changed the face of journalism was that what we referred to as a human interest or\nI Would say that she was she was born with a loud social conscience you mentioned her father who was a prominent obstetrician gynecologist in St Louis her mother had always been involved in human rights and women's suffrage and you know they were very not just liberal minded\nBut there are minded\nAnd active in their social views they took steps they did things\nAnd she was always going to be that sort of person that being said I think she was very surprised to go over to Spain and find herself completely born away and to this career and when they began to fall\nCall your center you know throughout the countries of Europe sort of basically taking the pulse of those countries that were about to fall into the shadow\nOf fascism and you know all these nations are tumbling toward\nWorld War two that all the journalists on on hand and being at the time sort of predicted that this would happen if no one intervened\nBecause Franco was forming these terrible alliances with Hitler and with Mussolini and these were dark times and suddenly Europe with a very different place and I think she lost some faith\nAbout I don't know she's she learned some love lost some love for Europe and and all these people were like you know bearing their head in the sand not for not paying attention\nAs was FDR's shadow was FDR who she you know consider to be um\nYou know I'm a friend and ally points in our life\n... what happened when yellow horn joined him in a way in ...\n[noise] so this is my favorite part of their story and so when Spain fell in the world was falling pieces Hemingway decided he wanted to go to Cuba to begin this novel which would become for whom the bell tolls away from the pressures of family life\nAnd he asked her to join him basically saying you know the world might not be here tomorrow but\nWho is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to a defeat\nWho chose to vote no announced or no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nWith China and when she had which he said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way it has to I've known to many other women like this\nAnd and she is behind in North Dakota by us ... about as much as you mentioned is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck\nShe also chose to vote no and a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right and you know I think that's I think he got three democratic votes\nAnd um and it was assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee even if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh is until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd and so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think by what the Republican but Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president of the United states admitted that she was a credible with yeah Philly decided ...\nKavanaugh's performance which she\nSorted kind to apologize for in the wall Street Journal editorial\nThat performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both Schumer and McConnell\nSet in their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true for the country for the Senate for the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it devolved at at the end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states and its standing\nWhich is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United states\nWell let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh's testimony as the bitter wrist\nPartisan testimony in memory he said that this was a nominee or had\nHard right conservative George jurisprudence and then the dam broke there were questions about him according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school a completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\nSaying that hidden sinister meetings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great indignity that there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had and it's a vote that went for Kavanaugh\nThis is special coverage from NPR News [noise] [noise]\nOh\nYou're listening to that special coverage you've been listening
