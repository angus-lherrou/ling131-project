I moved I was I grew up acting when I was a kid in Atlanta I mean I I\nDon't mean to brag but I did Six Flags over Georgia commercial although yeah ah one of the first times I got a big paycheck and it was big too a Thirteen year old I did a chick fillet industrial\nUm of course we did not film on Sunday\nAnd uh so I I grew up doing theater\nMoved to LA\nHad some success beamed up on Star Trek I got to where both the man sex in the city um but not the kind of\nNot the kind of success I had hoped for and truly out of the blue a friend from college an old friend from college emailed me saying I'm putting together a new public radio show in New York and we're looking for a host you have anybody might suggest and\nI I was not happy in my marriage and I was not happy in LA and I kind of you know the famous story about Dick Cheney he was he was supposed to find vice presidential candidates for for George Bush and he became vice presidents like Dick Cheney myself\nIn there and I'm within months I moved to New York to host of a public radio show on on public radio international I'd never done this before and my learning curve was\nDeep but I got to take the spotlight off me and ask people questions I get to do what you do Lois and ... you will probably agree with me it's how lucky or week I mean you get to be professionally nosy right [laughter] yes I learned about truly listening I'm and not just\nNot just asking questions because your questions are funny and you want to sound glib or chummy\nBut really I mean it ... my entry into public radio took everything I had ever valued or I think was good at and turned it into a career so I Love listening I Love asking questions I Love\nDoing research and and reading about people or seeing amazing films um I Love improvisation and of course everyone knows the key to good improvisation is listening and saying yes [noise] and\nTaking the spotlight off of myself which I had been trying to do for decades and turning it on\nSomebody else was just that was the break that that was what was so life changing I thought this is this feels good feel so much better to help other people tell their stories than to try to get attention\nAnd yet it's the ultimate tribute to the interviewer if the interview a shot yes that's right [laughter] the only way shining faith say\nHer book is approval and chunky with artistic director Susan booth and the alliance theatre\nFaith has adapted that memoir for this day and that will be part of the alliance theaters twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen season in their newly renovated at home\nYou are listening to city lights on W.
