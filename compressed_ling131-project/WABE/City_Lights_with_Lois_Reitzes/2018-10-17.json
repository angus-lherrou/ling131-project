wanted to make sure we honored the simplicity of ... and and shepherd that was paramount to everything we did and\nWhen you entered the illicit illustrator crack\nAnd especially given that these beautiful sketches are right or on campus at the high museum of art we had to make sure that we matched the simplicity and the elegance of those in our design and in the performances as well\nUm so it was really about reducing reducing until we got to the truth of these characters\nUm and the music is interesting because he thinking a musical the old adage is when the emotions become so heightened that's when you have to break into song because spoken word is no longer a\nAdequate um but with Winnie the Pooh it seems when the emotions get heightened he gets still and quiet so [laughter] it would be sort of counterintuitive to have him break into this Broadway song and dance so we wanted the music to have a much more\nContemplative element and I'm dealing Frederick is our music director and he arranged the songs we ask them to really think about the way children sitting in their ... visit tore pure beautiful way when they'll just break into a song and sing it over and over\nSo that's the quality that we tried to get to to\nLow people into this meditative state that I think ah the sketches and the stories do so beautifully there\nAre multiple stories of ... and his friends it's banned the years what is the focus of this specific story you are bringing to the state\nSo it it comes from the the first volume of ... and I'm In ... it's tracking a few different stories that that tied together um one is your losing his tail port ... or\nA one is Cangus arrival and the hundred acre wood and she is a newcomer to to the the wood and is scares rabbit so there's a plot to I'm trying to scare her out of the woods at first and that's all part of the framework\nUm there's also mention of the ... and that certainly worries little Piglet quite a bit and then it it's tiring all of these different stories together\nA light bulb just went on is that\nHe's supposed that's where the game and that tail on that don't originated it's so\nYou you mentioned that we do a reference that at the end of our show\nAnd and we're not sure we need to do some more research but it was ... again it was that light bulb for us and there were her Solomon the director Lee or Morris realized wait a minute we must end this play with you for having a surprise party for or\nYeah because I mean the these things have seen a lot of interaction you like some people leave things outside of the doors will yes it is that something you ever could have predicted would happen when he stood out oh\nAbsolutely not and that's one of the things that kept me going at the beginning\nYou know the idea was I'll just do one I'll do one of the crop tunnel it's a great place to start and so I put one door on the crowd tunnel and then thought for sure what was going to happen if you've ever been to the crowd tunnel everything there gets painted over it's constant constant conversation between artists and so I thought here's what's gonna happen I'll put up a door I'll come back the next day it'll be painted over\nNow but he painted over but nothing happened for months I just watched it sit there and then slowly one day I walked up and there were eight tiny cats [laughter] all pointed at the door as though they were waiting for someone to feed them\nOne that is a lot of cats yeah [laughter] it's about enough that there was just one cat\nBut there were eight and they were arranged perfectly in it I mean it boggles my mind and made me really happy and very curious and then I watched for months after that as more and more things appeared and one day a tiny newspaper about the tiny door appeared was a tiny Atlanta Journal constitution and I got\nReally happy and that's when I open the Instagram and that's when I thought well maybe I could do one more mhm you know and now the doors only go where their request it\nIn the past some of the doors have been damaged seemingly on purpose and seemingly in response to a they're openly pro algae GQ imagery um I remember seeing a remember seeing you posting on on ... the one on the crowd total a got 'em\nAt all at some point seen some kind of vandalism\nUm could you talk about the importance of making that sort of personal political statement was with these with these works\nSo as a queer woman it it just was important to me that I stay true to myself and this and the doors are not\nGay doors and they're not straight doors doors for everyone and part of being for every one\nIs that it's going to need to I Need to make it speaks to myself and to the\nPeople around me and for me the door door number two specifically which is on your old forth worth skate park on the outlines of has a rainbow around it and I we did it for pride a few years ago\nAnd then it kind of stuck kind of became the rainbow door and because of that commitment to the rainbow it has been vandalized more than any other door for sure\nYeah I remember\nJust kind of being amazed seeing the something that small could get that big of a reaction mhm somebody\nI'm I'm Amazed also [laughter]\nI mean\nI I'm not sure that there's really a question here but like you how do you how do you process that kind of reaction\nSo it depends on if I feel like it's incidental or purposeful\nIf I feel like someone just had a can of blue paint and they decided to highlight the door and highlight a bunch of stuff I go okay and I go fix it if it's beaten in with Iraq or you know something I keep 'em I keep a lot of\nDoors on reserves in the studio and I go replace them pretty instantly runners are my favorite because runners will send me pictures immediately when something [laughter] um and I and I go fix it and\nSo how process that is one time I was talking to the people who run art on the line and I said how many people are on the line on a weekly basis she sat on the east side trail the is about twenty thousand people a week well and I said OK sympathies twenty thousand people a week and on an average week one of the ... needs\nSignificant repair\nThat's not that bad and even then it's not usually that significant it's little touches up it's a hundred and three paint jobs under a number six but it's you know to me I Try to remember that more often than not there are so many pictures that I see on Instagram using the hash tag I see people\nCaring about them and feeling like they belong to their neighborhood and it really keeps me going\n\nThere and ... and the tiny ... speaking with our producer my job [noise] tiny doors celebrated for years the summer and you can find a map of all the doors at tiny doors ACL
