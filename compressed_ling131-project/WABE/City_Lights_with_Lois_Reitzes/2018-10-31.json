I really want to hear new descending staircase\nI really want to hear this that or the other and so\nThe concert or the the program involved in a way that a in a way in which old pieces that were much much loved and sometimes even commissioned by now the clear would be able to speak and relate and comment and refer to new pieces that the ensemble had never song\nAnd so it's it's some of the back then as well as the the right now\nWell you know low as about twenty five years ago I woke up after being engaged to play the green piano concerto myself\nAnd I thought wow this was the piece that my mother always told me about when she was a little girl growing up in Vienna the dream that she had to become a concert pianist and make her debut in that piece [noise]\n\nMaybe I could write a book [noise]\nMaybe I could find a way to tell her story if I could bring it especially the young people\nBecause I felt that the messages and the story very much because my mother held on to music and the darkest times\nAnd went after a dream a despite so many obstacles and challenges I felt that those messages would really really inspiring impact my readers the audience is if I could ever get it out there and so I Am an example and I tell this to young people now when I bring the story\nOf someone who never gave up on a dream and it was it wasn't easy and I went through rejections and lots of stuff along the way and finally I got a book published called the children of closed in line and so to speak the rest was history for me I got it launched\nAnd I'm so many wonderful educational foundations believed in the power of it\nOn the Milken Family Foundation facing history and ourselves and they helped me to grow and an educational initiative built around the book and the performances um\nThen my path crossed about I Would say about eight years ago with a phenomenal artist by the name of her she felt her he fell in love with the story and he took a chance on me he said let's see if we can adapt this for a one woman a theatrical production\nSo I plunged in really not knowing much about at all about the theatrical world I mean after all my background was a concert pianist\nBut I had a fire in my heart to want to do it and I studied he took a chance on me he got me an audition at the gas and play house we open the show I called the pianist of rules didn't land based on the book\nAnd it was was wonderfully received when we went month after month after month and then he started touring me and the last set of years he's brought me really across America and recently to London and two shows to a um theatrical run to the St James theater\nAnd um\n[noise] along the way I kept growing my educational mission because I felt\nIt was so important to try to ... enlarged the audiences to young young students and so we've grown that into what we call the wheels didn't read where ... through the foundation we gift copies of the books to school districts\nAnd then we do unabridged version of the show and a large theater I'm\nJust in a few days now here in Los Angeles I'm going to be bringing the Wilson read to twelve thousand students at the door the channel to Brazilian in Los Angeles just came from ah Portland where thousands have been reading it\nAnd then I'll make my way to Pittsburgh were nearly I think Seventeen thousand students are reading the book right now and will ...\n... uh experience the show so when my past crossed with ambassador steward Eisen staffed who saw the performance in Washington DC about half a year ago on behalf of the defiant requiem foundation\nKey I saw the power of the story and the potential and then he came to see my performance is again recently the Kennedy Center where we did the theatrical run\nAnd he bestowed upon me the great honor to come to Atlanta and bring this performance or to the to this year's Stuart ... lecture yes now the story\nIs based upon your mother is\nHow do how do we say your mother was one of those children in the ... transport the children's trains that uh were supported by British charities that moved thousands of European children to safety in England\nThat was a mixed blessing ... transport\nWhat was the impact Tom family sending children way right very powerful question as you can imagine I often ask myself what was my grandmother feeling that day when she put my mother on the train\nAnd said goodbye to her and actually that particular scene at the train station which my mother told me about over and over when I was a little child is the number one reason why why I set up to tell the story and want to share it with the world [noise]\nMy mother would put me to sleep at night or sometimes in the piano lessons when she taught me and she would tell me how her mother\nAt the vest one whole train station took her face in our hands and begged her to keep a promise which was to hold on to your music and I'll be with you every step of the way through the music\nAnd my mother you know it just didn't want her mother to see that she was crying but she made a vow that she would hold onto that music and that her mother would be there with her\nSo that the age of fourteen she was put on that train\nAnd I often wonder what did my mother feel as the train sped away\nAnd the story then becomes what happened to her when she arrived in England along with these other ten thousand Jewish children who are all scattered to hostile to homes to farms different parts of England\nAnd my mother begins this incredible journey or that actually takes or near Brighton\nA into a place called peacock manner where she was put to work she worked as a seamstress\nAnd at nighttime she would sneak down to the parlor where the piano was and trust and allowed to play the piano so she played above the keys and imagined that her mother and father were listening to her and her sisters and it's a very pivotal moment in the story\nBecause even though she's safe and has plenty to eat [noise]\nShe thinks to herself as the music feels her up this was not why they chose her\nBecause to go back in the story my grandfather was only able to procure one ticket\nAnd the family had three daughters\nSo the decision of who they were going to choose\nWas so excruciating [noise]\nAnd they chose my mother and she would often tell me because they felt that the music would give her the strength to survive\nHow does this story move from\nStay well if you're lucky enough you meet someone like her she found her who takes the chance on you and has the genius to um\nCombined music music and storytelling when I met him\nI had a little prototype because the book could come out\nAnd the publishing house would send me around the country to do book signings and different things and they felt that the power would also be through the music so sometimes they would roller spin it into the bookstore um and I would do a little you know taste of it\nSo I had to kind of a of model of what I wanted to do but I had no clue of how you would bring it to the theater\nAnd it was my lucky day when it crossed with a they seemed comfortable artist\nWho then took the Emery out so to speak and gave birth to the baby he designed an extraordinary set of um incredible golden frames that through which he projected a world lost\nA the Europe that we know that his last and the kennel sat on the frame and then there was a broken frame around the entire stage to again represent a world that has gone from us [noise] uh he designed incredible lighting he grew the stage production to Ninety minutes he chose very carefully the\nPieces of music my mother would always say when I was a little girl the each piece of music tells a story\n\n\n[noise]\nBut you have to discover what that story is so we chose very carefully together you know the ... the Greek piano concerto which of course was the dream and is the is the light motif through that through the entire story and um [noise]\nWas far away\nLooking into the sun\nArmed another war\nFor because there wasn't no\nBurned into my chest\nA loner and um watch by will disarm\nWill the sun's reborn\nWithin the psyche over so\nOne of the things violate truth about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "City Lights with Lois Reitzes", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "31"}
