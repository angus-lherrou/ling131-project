Georgia disputes dot com\nHad written a play called ... black bottom\nAnd he submitted it to the O'Neill play writing center in Connecticut and like Richard some wonderful director and dean of the drama school us read the play and decided to produce it as August first play so he really was a new play right completely untested\nAnd I was serving at the time as the resident music director of the Yale repertory theater and what year was that was early Nineteen eighties probably around Nineteen eighty one eighty two\nAnd so Lloyd called us together and Lloyd said\nA heavily young playwright I Want you to read I think there might be some talent there you can really and that's how we met and we both had our yellow pads and we came in and in large office so I said there's a play about ... black bottom do you know anything about my rainy\nAnd I said of course I Know everything about ...\nAnd he said there's only one there's only one hitch with this new play\nAnd that is that the actors will have to play their musical instruments still have to play live on stage and I immediately said to Lloyd in August so that's impossible you'll never find actors good enough to play out the music and then August very quietly said\nThey'll have to play the music and so that was our first challenge together\nSo we literally had to do was in most cases we had to teach the actors how the instruments and took over a period of two and a half years oh wow because we were in pre production and we're taking to play all around the country so we had time to work with\nEach of the actors are helped him get up to speed and in fact Charles Dutton and I became roommates or he he and I shared an apartment so that we can get up in the morning and do jumping lessons and he was so aggressive and wanting to do the park completely\nPull out um that's how we got a chance to accomplish that shows a bit of a it was a bit of an illusion because some of the channel parts were actually pre recorded\nBut you wouldn't have known it because we had just enough to live piano so that when we snuck in the uh the recorded piano you wouldn't know it and so they lose and I think was quite successful because\nI'm very few people knew when it was live and when it was taped monitor rainy the legendary a finger was often called the mother of the blues\nAnd I I I Would love for us to hear that clip we have I Believe that says ... ... ... that's right the actress who played her sing monitoring these black box\nWay down in Alabama I ran the cow man grave rock bottom you're praying for a

hopped shop Venezuelan born conductor who is also the music director of the Los Angeles philharmonic it was the first time many of the MPs students had traveled abroad\nThey performed in an orchestra concert alongside three hundred young musicians\nFrom all around the Merrick I learn more about that very special experience from Dante Romo the co founder and executive director of the land and music project\nAnd fourteen year old violinist Donovan fuller\nDominance been playing for seven or eight years and I asked him water rich and ... tracked him to the violin\nI don't know I just like I like the ... this out whenever\nI Will go to sleep when I was young my mom would always play classical music and ... you know most of the times you hear the violence and and they they place we saw that I asked my mom said mama would issue and his militia that is that she said it's a violin dive in those I I Want to play a shipment oh\nI Want to go somewhere I Want to learn how to put a ...\nAnd ... was the Atlanta music project the logical place for dominance and\nWe're very fortunate that Donovan joined us I remember it was the summer of twenty eleven we had our first summer program at our one of our city of Atlanta recreation center sites\nAnd Donovan came along in June and I still have the picture of his first lesson when he was like six years old and now a seven eight years later he's he's playing with could start with Tim Allen students from around the world it really is incredible\nAnd I think that it's a testament to the talent in Atlanta and in the neighborhoods that we that we serve and it's so important you just never know where\nThe desire to drive the passion is going to come from and it's just so important that we keep having music in the schools are so important that we continue to get great support from the local community to support kids like Donovan that have a a passion\nAnd a need a way to express it\nAnd you know Gustavo Dudamel about is um it may be fair to say the most sensational conductor alive I mean he has this passion and fire and sharman charisma\nBut he is also very slowly dedicated to\nBringing music into under served areas into remote parts of Venezuela as we know [noise] um and I was wondering if you could tell us what it is like for you watching him rehearsed with this youth orchestra\nIt was absolutely incredible Gustavo is a special special conductor I don't know of any other conductors of his class that are this dedicated to\nYouth and music she she for his foundation partially funded this and I was in his dressing room after the concert in Mexico city\nAnd his um guys you're telling people start when you have to go you have a ... with the armonica Vienna Philharmonic at nine out of the news right and they said you don't have time to put pictures with the kids and he put his head and in his\nAnd he was so disappointed she actually kind of you know refuse their instructions looking like two or three picture she's incredibly dedicated to to working with you and it's very good at it too [noise]\nSo what's your take away from the ... I mean you have\nMom knew the planet music project on the ... the state law on this system in Venezuela that dude I'm Out came up to ... um how has this enhanced what\nYou do hear\nIt's not very clear to me that we must expand um we we must have waves and programming to have more kids from Atlanta be part of this organization I'm we're going to establish our headquarters space and we're going to be looking for support for that and it'll allow us to serve a lot more students\nAnd I think there's just so important that we continue to keep the program intensive because one student\nLearn to play the instrument properly they end up getting skills I can help them in their life in school determination grit teamwork time management these are all transferable skills\nSo our friend on your may not end up playing in an orchestra if he does fantastic but I have no doubt that whatever Donovan does he was going to be successful because he's been successful at the violin\n[noise]\nUm we recently had an event with Angelica Harris doesn't who came up through the Atlanta symphonies talent development program and um\nYou were on the panel down to the challenge the stats and an an orchestra performed\nAnd we talked about getting more kids involved with music and Thomas in what your thoughts and your ideas about getting kids involved with classical\nMusic and what you see as the barriers or the opportunities for ...\nUm\nI Do favor kids going into classical music I say would you do classical music\nIt boosts your confidence up a lot you know\nPlaying an estimate besides listening to wrap a day or or the songs you know having listening to classical music you know as soon as yours so it it it gets to you in it and it makes you say hey I Want to play this oh hey I Want to do this or not grow up in their kids get a hold of debt now\nLike they say if you ... if you try to play a trumpet or the violin divided especially when you're older we're twenties it's not going to happen now not going to have you got to get it young ... and I see do get it while you're young you have a greater chance of\nDoing things you know you always had to be an ... like like I discussed earlier ... he said you can do gigs you know you can get pay or the dad do it or shut and doing that you know you'll have to get a job you don't have to work for other people\nYou can work for yourself and do what you love most\nThat I Love your going back to I'm Talking about the sole ensued then your soul and how your mum played classical music for you when you just\nKnew that the violin was speaking to your do you think you are a different violent it's now just after this time in Mexico\nMost most definitely a when I went to Mexico I saw that he has them all the energy that the kids play with I\nWith my so you know they they play with energy with ... energy but when I go here they play like adults they don't play like teenagers to pull a lever third tenth grade as they put like they're about to get ready to try out for\nThe New York philharmonic the Los Angeles philharmonic they play like they want to do this they play like that ... is there all the best of life\nAnd you feel like the instrument is your life while you're playing it yes\nWhen I was planning during the costs are I there was so\nIs where I got emotional show it 'cause we play some songs that were there there were very special you know we play oh no if you heard of him his name is John Williams we play a dodge fill\nThe star wars songs are set is like is slow and that got me and when we play divorce shock of set the new uh ... the fourth movement\nIt was fast it was moving and I like fast to move the sauce like you know Beethoven and all that and is it just great and I feel like when I went there I learn new techniques you know not to just play but to actually play and play it from the heart\nAnd that was from the heart a fourteen year old violinist Donovan fuller alongside the very impressive they're finding music project co founder and executive director Dante Romo\nThis is city lights um W.
