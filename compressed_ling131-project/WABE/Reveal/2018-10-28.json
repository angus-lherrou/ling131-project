she and Kimberly are playing but everything Kimberly does how she reaches for the rattle how she holds it the way she tries to squirm off the table it's all a test trying to answer one question\nIs she able to do what's expected of a seven month old now for the most part yes but\nBut I noticed that you know there was a little ... here in terms of self regulation is what I just notice so far\nAs even monitoring faded to divest what is you know just ... yeah\nThere's a very wide range some kids are doing really well and some kids are very compromised I'm noticing a lot of small motor the nays

issues trouble swallowing walking seeing\nThat there hasn't been that many studies on his kids and the samples right now thinks that same publisher thirty kids you know for the kids and and we have two hundred we have over two hundred\nSo that's why we think this data is really important to publish but\nIt's not clear if this study will ever see the light of day the health department needs to authorize publication and so far it's refused to do so\nI told them that I've made in my head I said I can live here being completely unethical who were you talking to and you said your officials from the department of health that were in charge of this week a monitor and they have now I\nI've never seen politics getting involved on and on research no way than to looks like\n[noise] Mm

make sure ah\nSamples collected all over the line where ... percent that I Love what I thought he in the department of health and like what the take off on this uh\nTo the CDC love what I thought he

the health secretary before she can share any more details\nIt's not that I can talk to anybody when it without being authorized because we want to have a\nThe correct message\n\nAfter we part ways I'm left standing in that convention center hallway and what starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the ... with me or even their own top secret doctors several doctors told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nIn silence doctors like ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the government to make the get go away ... Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nQuestion you know that the ... that make the notion of having a guy by the end my hair effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nTourism it's the lifeblood of the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talked to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much the effect of the island\nIt was a huge in fact\n... remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico in two thousand sixteen\nThe numbers they weren't even were really really high and scary and we had lots of

segregated neighborhoods [noise]\nLocal housing officials recognize that this is a problem and ... is actually one of the most\nSegregated cities in the country\nA few years ago the Houston housing authority tried to take a small step to address the issue\nIt didn't go well\nOfficials had this idea to build a mixed income apartment building in a wealthier part of town called the Galleria is known to this giant glitzy mall with an ice skating rink\nSome of the units in the building would have to accept vouchers getting poorer families access to better schools\nBut hundreds of angry he's donations revolted\nHere for [noise]\n\nBack in twenty six teams they showed up in force to a public meeting at the neighborhood elementary school it was standing room only lasted for hours [noise]\nAlmost all the people in the crowd were white they complained that the building was too expensive way overcrowded schools lower property values\nFor free\nBut\n[noise]\nPeople sent written comments to one person complained about what they called pollution an upscale neighborhoods with the poor [noise]\nOnly a few people spoke up in favor of the proposal including a woman named ...\nWho is really rooted in your shoes you know\n... black and she works for a housing advocacy group\nShe told the audience the people who want to\nLive here are your janitors your ... your wait staff\nSo we want to say you're\nYou're [noise]\n\n\nWhen this whole debate was going on Pamela banks was watching it unfold and thinking about our clients these apartments could have helped them\nIf they could move that neighborhood with a voucher they could get a leg up but the project was killed not long after that public hearing I called him recently and played or some of the tape\nThe part where the guy talks about compassion for people who need affordable housing but also about poison grapes Pam told\nMe it made her think about how after the hurricane people set up animal shelters on outside of town\nIn the gallery ... show just out there saying we can't be out there for a dog do you value your in your neighborhood\nThere's a reason pan is saying we and us here for her it's personal in her late twenties after she and her husband separated him landed in Houston as a single mom she applied for a section ... voucher and waited for seven years to get one\nWhen she finally got her voucher back in Nineteen Ninety seven Pam spent months searching for a place that would take it one day she came across this listing the brick house with a fireplace in the suburbs in an area known for better schools so she drove out there to meet the landlord\nIt was raining I got out there and it was that by Europe and America later we're going to be inducted she got out toward the house\nPam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave she went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\nSaid okay if that's it and I have housing you know I Know you may or may not know about housing neo stereotyped image but take this on a pre about it in and let me know if you want to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after ... and the kids move than she bought her own house [noise]\n\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise us from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon in New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they banned any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers\nAnd they can be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen\nIndiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter does she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take altered so she got that\nWhat she she gets back\nTo a certain extent but I don't know how to understand the\nUh [noise]\nThe discrimination or part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype because of a voucher\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of the Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those have post so what's going on here why are so many landlords\nWilling to take out or is in Texas\nBut I Do this you know the utilization of sex with a discriminatory tool it'll\nThis is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they notice section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacey Hi earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that\nAnd disagree with that I think that the ... and ... situations you know they choose to live for their support group for their family is where transportation where the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Edgar told Stacey on about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe book it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks like Stacy says this can hurt a landlord bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\n... through for this lady or would have to call the the people in this quest\nNest quest we'd heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad you sent officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and you're wanting to see if nests quest could really help people like Denny's so I'll let him take it from here\nHere's how ... works they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch\nWhat does family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for you\nOn ... those are automatic\nWe also secure all the utilities for the Internet ... not have to do anything this is Isabel Lopez executive director of math class and we also guaranteed a complaint will maintain runners insurance in the unit [noise] um and then upon move out we are willing to fit the bill for any damage as\nWhen Isabelle took this job NASCAR is titled one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children move to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no to that and the first time we actually had a heart talking to landlords [noise] it was honestly it was really discouraging\nTo the fact that under mess class that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's but there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now um they have this guarantee\nThat everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it's still that hesitation that I don't want to work with someone who was on section eight\nAs a mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places the mask laws help\nFive of them are staying in properties managed by the company Stacy how ... works for\nThat's out of thirty
