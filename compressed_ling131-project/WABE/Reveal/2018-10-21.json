allegations that he had been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nWell I Would disagree with that statement what we're doing just within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls\nNo I don't believe we have them and we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta have secure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nLast time my my [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThere's some concerns over there [noise]\nAnd with Angela ... she's an investigative reporter from a PM reporters [noise] we've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year\nAnd our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie is any more than two dozen others the perjury is are disproportionately affecting people of color\n[noise] ran in a way [noise]\nMoultrie if the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes streets along rows of one story ramshackle houses and [noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed is perhaps some are boarded up and the residents have moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college or the military\nI Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nI like the mayor and you'd\nWe're still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to seek Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council and how you doing but he's also a businessman and pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love\nHe says his family's lived in the area for generations\nIt's my great grandparents uh it was small sharecroppers\nReverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes she says well he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections I came across all quite a few people and the alleged in Iranian some of them went down to vote\nAnd they could and then uh I had two people said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusion like that during the election as not\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe raise is that like is no longer or to vote in there and I think that's what we're we're we're in trouble with\nThen Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nBy there oh yeah yeah he won't pass she's my\nState record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does his aunt know that she's been taken off the voting\n[noise]\nAngela and I find ms ...\nThey're living in a small house just outside multiply\n... famous Honda\nHi I'm Angela completely I'm a reporter with ... Senator John and\nOn a story about people who send removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this but\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I'm very that Obama is running do you remember a hand\nYou know the book making what I mean\nThen I last July you were taken off the voter lists I Would have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen hands but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nNeed news from this you know [noise]\nDid you know there there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss ... she had no idea she'd been perch although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes obey the rules to back it Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter list and she had no idea ...\nThat's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\n[noise] no I think we need to get down to the bottom of it because if it happened to her to Rome and she she\nShe says it just confirms his view that voter suppression is happening\nIt almost gives people the ... mine said that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege as they get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take his aunt to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand vermouth for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor\nWhen it comes to the perjury is Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's a solution let people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is All right period\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and while the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's at a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate\nA bit I doubt it how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know on October the first so there is a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November ... you're not uninformed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's fair\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camped wins if the racial breakdown of voters days about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough you have to\nPolarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. V. E. in as a poodle from a PM report [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking no I Would not counted as heck in\nWhat was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on reveal\nReading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense but this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the elections the scenes problematic [laughter]\nBy September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done someone from the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote we discovered we're a little out of our debt [laughter]\nFinally the elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first email that\nThey think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us reading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like oh this is over except it's not [noise]\nYou might be wondering what brain can't pass to say about all this well\nDespite move inland downloading dreams sensitive information which kept called deeply concerning Kemp also said that Georgia is protected which layers upon layers of security and specifically he's made two arguments number one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet which makes them safer from hacking\nAnd number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you need a wide scale conspiracy actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments wrong richton Milo is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech he used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nDon't need to mount an attack on thousands\nThousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word at target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above the threshold\nPlus he says because Georgia system is so centralized there are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's part of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making you know they're scared to death they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems they have no idea why they work or don't work and they're kind of living in constant fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around two years\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy\nI was like Christ I ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found that case you and he said no tell me more\n[laughter] they sit down at a computer and download everything again except this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so were you able to get the exact same amount of stuff the second time\nA effectively yeah so nothing had changed well they had a tempted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do\n[laughter] okay [laughter]\nThose those by my reaction [noise]\nYeah [laughter] I don't really understand [noise]\nKen didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat she oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cybersecurity expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake or they're just so many opportunities\nLimited truly only by one to manage a nation to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings were troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studies the arteries and they're vulnerable it is not says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject basically our a virus into any part of this ... the way it's set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the ...\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta it was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom on the other side we're\nCamps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adapting have our ballots over electronic winds for the mid term elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the\nHearing kept team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites stretch Totenberg was having none of that\nHacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with informal systems in machines that very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight team and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first you know that\nWe know our elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to death\nUh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nAh reveals by Dr brought us that story\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp Savage to commission that look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty\nOh and the other four states heading into the midterms they used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New
