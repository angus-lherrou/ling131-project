actual thing they study actually is us part about whether we should just be looking at the great speeches of the great Randall politicians often present\nOr whether or not rhetoric is something that

they can also be a way of breaking down on building bridges of finding common ground between people\nAnd finding that common ground is crucial in a world facing a Marietta complex problems such as climate change political upheaval an economic inequality knowing how to build\nTowering pros out of ordinary phrase it can make it possible to alter the course of history\nThere's a rhetorical from

characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major premise a minor permits to the conclusion it's much easier to just use a two word phrase or hash tag\nThat usually ends up adding to that kind of political division between my side and their side so more and more we have to learn to be critical consumers of the messages around us and we need to understand what it is that makes it persuasive and then ultimately make a decision for ourselves\nWhat are we willing to be persuaded by\nProfessor Phillip ... is also a past president of the rhetorical society of America\nOne of the things we see particularly in politics around the world these days are what would be considered fallacious arguments one that we hear a lot especially in democracy is what the Romans called at population which is an appeal to the people\nAnd this is when you sort of say well everybody agrees everybody knows everybody saying all of us agree to this\nYou talk to every single expert and you just talk to ordinary people you talked to businesses everybody understands that the problem is not getting better is getting worse\nMaybe we actually don't all agree to this but you're just creating the illusion that there's some public opinion where there's actually not any opinion that's been articulated by the public the other that we hear a lot in contemporary politics is the ad hominem which is an attack on the person and so\nEspecially I guess in our country it seems of last few years the politicians have been much more likely to go negative attacking aspects of the character of another candidate and not actually dealing with the issues\nThat matter you know just ... you probably are worse the gym but [noise] I Will say anything nasty guy now I Know why he doesn't have one endorsement on his own thing covered\nOver through had populism or it goes negative as an ad hominem we may find ourselves persuaded but we still don't really know the basis of the dance of the candidates were now supporting\nLet's say you're reading an article on line about whatever's going on in the world and the rhetoric and there is so when you one way or the other the more you know about rhetoric the more you can see when you are maybe being persuaded in a way that you don't want to be persuaded\nCare meisters one of Kendall Philip students for her there are clear reasons to concentrate who studied on rhetoric and its influence on her generation she's twenty two but that doesn't make it easier to describe the cost to friends\nA lot of times they don't even know what rhetoric is there like so what are rhetorical studies in to this day I still struggle with explaining it but I think it's frustrating when people are reading things that are kind of your swayed but you're like no really read the tuna line see what they are saying and I think when you don't really understand the true meaning of rhetoric you don't realize how you're being persuaded\nIf we can be so easily influenced by the words around us is this yet another arena when machines may have something to teach us\nI think that one of the claims made by ms ... was that people should choose how to spend their money I Would like to offer a different view people should spend their hard earned money as they please but says project\nDebater is an artificial intelligence system created by IBM in June it made it public debut in San Francisco debating with a human opponent on the topic of subsidizing space exploration\nYet time will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne of the possibilities as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorce ended our mail same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the men are waiting a little bit longer they've separated we don't know if they separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork on this\nIs interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relation\nTo break out but she would notice every relationship breakup ... serving the finding of paperwork and maybe men just taking orders from paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nUnder the slow Cheech Christmas toys but you've researched relationships and how they work and how they work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been off for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep that relationship going what would you said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all of the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't last a nine year age gap\nIs almost certain divorce statistically right not knowing each other very law these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually tried not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people do\nIn the corner of the the wedding hole instead [laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences\nBecause women and same sex relationships do have a large age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationships but this is not actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationships so\nThe big age difference could have been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for a mate and comparing women and men in same sex relationship\nEconomist

to smile and and tougher and pretend\nThey they knew their place if not they were often actually treated violently by the police by anybody and so\nThe main jazz musician who Uncle Tom public was Louis Armstrong as great a musician as he was\nHe had come out of the deep south and that's what he had learned\nIs that that's how you survive\nThe hill moonshine in [noise]\nOn the ... we\nSaw Bruning\nSuffering low\nAnd cool was a math but say we are not going to smile or differ or laugh anymore where artist when musicians we're human beings and we will not allow white Americans to define who\nWe are and into the environment will to sex all finished school Lester Young who Joe you believed defined cool in one of its earliest forms in American culture right\nWell Lester Young took the word cool that was then heard in the after American community and he's the first person to use cool as a state of mind as a philosophy as an static\nWhen Lester Young said I'm cool he meant I Am here in my own style in this environment um and I'm relaxed which is not something that most\nBlack Americans could feel anywhere in the Nineteen forties ... can you just give us an idea of young for center in style\nSo Lester Young was cool and what that means at the time was he invented several different strategies we still associate with cool and they were all at first to defy racism and protect him\nSo one was not only did he speak in a jazz slang you also had very personal jazz slang such that\nIt was impenetrable it was a code second of all she wore sunglasses at night and onstage and sunglasses shades are in fact probably the single object most associated with cool if you actually tax the word cool what comes up as an icon with sunglasses on\nSo sunglasses provide a sense of mystery that's why they work that way\nBut she ... them at night and onstage as a way\nOf keeping white people at arm's length and ... he had slang walked in a very relaxed manner\nBut most of all Lester Young saxophone style was cool it was an urbane romanticism that was both elegant and expressive and arithmetic and it was one of the most distinctive artistic styles of the ... century\nHere's a brief Lester Young himself speaking in Nineteen fifty nine about the way African Americans with stereotyped\nAs in most major papers [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] for you\nTo\nSuck so finished Lester

other jazz musicians including the next generation people like the Trump it's a Miles Davis his music we had at the beginning of the program\nCarol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\n[noise] well Miles Davis was an African American troops to turn ... leader and became iconic in ...\n... how we changed jazz music Miles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home to so much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he comes up his style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style and this meant um jackets and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on\nUniversity campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles and she's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise] so it's very unusual even Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in a um says look a jacket beautiful pale colors to fight club for cap a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black therefore I Am dealing with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men you choose expense of universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why\nWas that this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public

that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nSet up to this point we defined cool is largely an African American concept something that was developed by John's musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manifesting itself in other ways like

was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow we knew our world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why do you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is say resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire too\nI refused that to reject optimism was a resounding way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film you know who are was not this was his honor that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nAnd Joe you set the cool appeal let's assume law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh but ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence\nOr Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of men and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIs he says that a rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if your rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nWe had no idea what form that like might take a call\nFor dean at with kicks and bomb sure\nYou can make it sound um if you want\nBut at least he was looking for that message and the smoke that one perfect solo or if you make it sound like looking for the great\nI think that's right and extract from ... on the right published in Nineteen fifty seven I'm\nTraumatized by at Thomas and for the BBC in Nineteen Ninety fool with just Lynn calming him as Laura and ... a south I'm today this idea that African Americans seem to hold the key to cool and could provide some kind of model to fight conformity\nGained currency thanks to an essay by the influential American writer Norman Mailer right\nYes ah the white negro superficial reflections on the hipster was written by Norman Mailer for dissent magazine in Nineteen fifty seven negro was a term used at the time by black Americans\nMiller argued in his essay that Nazi atrocities and the atomic bomb produced a widespread fear that we're all doomed that human extinction was imminent\nHe argued that this situation produced the phenomenon of hipsters have chosen not to live in fear but to reject what he called a slow death by conformity and escape boredom by unleashing their desires they chose to live in the present and celebrate energy in constant movement to swing\nHe wrote that they rejected the moral judgments of the past to experience immediate pleasures instead and for this mailer argued they turn to the example of African Americans because of slavery\nAnd a modern day racism knew all about how everyday life was dangerous and found refuge in pleasures of the body like dance and music\nOn the essay is actually offensive for the way it essential lives as African Americans associating them with the body over the mind with sexuality and heat and there's some these false stereotypes dated back to the ideology of slavery\nMiller was rightly criticized for example by the African American author James Baldwin who said that the essay infuriated him for its perpetuation of mess\nCurrent I Wonder if you sort of knew him and may lose argument the idea that just the fact of being blocked from Hawkins pose Qunu hips the status as he put it\nI completely agree with what Claudio says and the problems um\nWith that article and that is just about the ... the mind and not understanding\nThe reasons why I'm black people major I saw a gay gym music if a particular way as we've discussed earlier studies about situation themselves within the will to decide do being um belonging I've I've always refer to but I've also talked about in terms of\nBlack people coming over from the Caribbean for example in the Nineteen fifties to the u._k. to the u._k. but posing is away all of a ... a sense of self and self respect for them it's not seen as a negative thing\nWell I guess whatever we often 'cause no one male as I say it did help cement the idea of the rebel as who agree with you this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen wasn't it I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who quite different from the Nineteen forties film law heroes of Humphrey Bogart and Robert ...\n[noise] yes in movies Marlon Brando James Dean and also Montgomery cleft made rebellion attractive their style is disaffected a sensitive vulnerable and even plagued with self styled\nJames Dean was easy for why teenagers to identify with he became a superstar a legendary I kind of cool when he died in a car crash at age twenty four after having made just three films only one of which had been released east of eating\nThe other two are rebel without a cause and giant were released after his death\nHis disaffected attitude struck a chord with young people worldwide who saw on him their own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded\nAdults and this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous\nAs soon as the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings and the Senate people were persecuted for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any\nWere at extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified wholeheartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\nLet's hear from the Nineteen fifty five film rebel without a cause with James Dean as the archetype of teenagers struggling with his parents\nWe love and affection don't really old and one is it was\nIt because we wanted to that party you know what kind of drunken brawl kind of parties turn into starting place for kids\nTo go you say you didn't care if they drink said elemental\n\nYou'll

a film that space for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point here that these with the new teenagers very much opposed fulfillment\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy\nWas doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time for perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city's after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do there so you had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\n... the ... the fashion came to be seen as crucial to didn't they just want us the actors\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course these ... these everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of the a nasal unit farming around nineteenth teen was seen on the body of law them Brando in streetcar named desire then well by James Dean and rebel without a cause this\nDreaming

rebels spirit was a singer Elvis Presley\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] Joe\nSo wedded Elvis fits into this pantheon of coup\nElvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worshiped Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his head and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that this was a fan boy from Marlon Brando it's kind of a shock looking back but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is there is not a lot of his African American beers at the time also enjoyed his\nSinging and his take on NASCAR contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rock is an energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time\nSo we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted a second idea of crude across the globe but I Wonder what you will see how we really talking

Alexander Michigan and say that they have the same person and certainly people out\nJanine di ... the fact that the identification no surprise that he's a member of the geo you Russian military intelligence I think that's when it gets that he's a thought to be a doctor\nOr a medical doctor which of course that may tie in to the use of nerve agent that that could be someone who was part of the team precisely because none of them was being deployed either to protect the individuals who to know how to deal with it\nAnd another piece in the puzzle though of the makeup of that alleged team at all the script Paul Nurse nerve agent poisoning\n[noise] that's right ah um and I think it's surprising about this really is the fact that it it ... it is the outsiders have been able to identify two Russian military intelligence officers and telling them\nTo the geo you into an people who were supposed to be on the cover and I think you know ... or something which will I think worry the authorities in Moscow is the ease with which that is dumb\nAnd of course comes just a few days off to a full ... team was exposed by the Dutch government for trying to hack into the organization for the prohibition of the ... of chemical weapons in the Netherlands and so I think it is that sense of trying to put as much into the public domain in the hype of exposing and then perhaps pressuring the jail you average activities\nAnd and that's really interesting what you're saying about the availability of this information because this ... this latest development about Alexander Michigan comes off the back of the u._k. the U.S and other government because you were saying accusing and and and and bringing prove against\nRussian cyber some sabotage and and other kinds of an espionage how does the u._k. react how does the west generally react to this\nWell I I think well in some cases they've just been a I think I have a a a degree of unity which is probably some people I'm a last week you saw the U.S\nThe u._k. and the Netherlands will come out on the same day and to criticize the geo you an ... specify would it be not to when it came to kind of cyber activities now the spelling ... it's not a government documents and you know being\nWith the government but I think it is that same sense so the the best perhaps way of dealing with these activities by shining along told them\nAny reaction from Moscow no not yet uh I think we've had some skepticism before of course we should say that the two individuals who have been named as a geo you offices are happy to not only did they came on on on T.\nI'm a Moscow based TV channel and were interviewed and said that they were actually ... who'd come to the city of ... hundred and twenty three me to a spy at its cathedral\nJust finally Gordon ease you you talk about the interest in the ease by which this information and has has been obtained do you think because the tactics to obtain nice this information has become more developed or is it because the Russians are getting care less ...\nIt's a good question I think it's probably the bouncer was that was a bit of both I think there's probably a bit of subpoenas from the Russians and their tradecraft in using ... to ... numbers ... building in a deep enough identity and not understanding these databases but it's also true\nThat I think very very few people appreciate what you can do now with what's called open source intelligent somebody mixing aggregating comparing databases and different parts of information that allows you to do in terms of

definitely about showcasing the best version of yourself and that's a really exciting change to see\n... what about the term empower men is that is a good way to sell products\nTo be honest at the end when it comes to beauty I Do think that is a little bit overused I think that the rationale behind it it's extremely powerful and impactful but it can be deemed asked a marketing gimmick in in reason

the people I mean it just that's the way we think of them are criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes Adam ... they started cutting the pipes at Fox they started cutting you'll pipes yes\nSo that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will be like Oh nice to be a wife or their children to be the one thing they want to you know a kiosk ... income that's why we're able somebody\nThen there's a ... by there is that some times that they found out what we don't have mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they sat down and watch out there\nThis is Kenny old over he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a ... he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWe set for two shootings and they said for Penn\nSo you will say it's clean at my ... clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your sense yeah yeah so I Will find a way to work with them we will find a week without too don't put the impact of the system so that's your what's your ... [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] just listening\nTo Kenny tell his life story the sun makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nSolution here and we sell always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slum ... if you'd like he knows how to operate the\nYeah I didn't want to paint shelf though as a one man band Kennedy just up on his own doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and four is that what they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and\nHis wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit less still is a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that just shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size or everything's been signed off by the bull so okay and for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf though just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation a hotel room yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with all of the ... but there are other projects to ... the only ones who are trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nSo you're very wary of speaking up and and being a tool known as someone who might make any trouble\nPeople will say well it's free speech he has every right to go up and say these things and the things he quoted for example Oxford University extending exam times offensively to help the male candidates in stem subjects these are all things that have happened\nNot fit EnergyStar extension of time because they knew that goes for questioning narrative at at the end not confident enough when they were deciding the questions that that doing exams\nSo this wasn't saying goes all less able and I think that they kind of thing when a senior professor comes in and says you know you are intellectually unfair that will only make them less confident\nSo the only reason for it they're supposed to give them the fat chance because they realize that they were going through an awful lot of impulse to enjoy about being on a cause for that surrounded by boys who have these kinds of opinions and that maybe they needed to get them if either a ...\nA deep sense in the scientific community that there is a bit of pushback from perhaps none of a sudden generational men generally\nWho are bitter about\nSeeing women being given preferential treatment in the in the process of trying to make the field more representative women for example he will so I think gave the example professors term of Melbourne University offering women only clauses in stem subjects and also advertising mask positions only for women\nI've never experienced that and certainly in the kind of food out about this event the people who have been really angry and really saying oh yeah this is completely right\nAh people either with absolutely no academic affiliation anymore or people who work within this one particular area of high energy particle physics\nSo I don't know what the safe area of theoretical particle physics has a really hard time in recruiting women and it's and in that sense has done these things I mean I Can't comment on that\nBut I Would say that the men that I've encountered have been incredibly supportive of initiative to encourage more women to to participate and to be retained within science\nSo he's not representatives anyway\nI genuinely do not believe he's representative I think unfortunately these kinds of opinions give voice to an awful lot of angry Charles online he seemed to really really like getting what about things like this I don't know if you had time to read the\nUm ... put forward by about two and a half thousand people walking within political physics from all over the world and they will find this very very well versed in life to\nArguing his points case by case and saying you know this isn't true this isn't true you've gotta go here and look at the states and this has been fined by senior women and men within the failed so I really don't think he's representative I think he might be\nFrom a particular school of thought that ... on the way out in science because the majority of people working nights as diverse teams do you buy the science\nDo you think is worse in science in terms of gender inequality and sexism and the industry than most other fields\nI think that an academic science you have very very weighed Powell relationships that you don't have another field so you'll direct Korea puff is determined by people like this so professors who have ultimate power if you're going to do in your life\nAnd that's all that opinion really really ... the majority of people who are in senior positions are old men because that's what history has done and we've not go to a stage yet where we can change that\nSo I think that this is all power relationship with an academic science such and he makes these kind of beliefs and ideologies a bit stronger than in other professions\nDon't suggest waited imperial college here in London where women are pushing back Keli Ramirez is this soil microbial ecologists and co founder\nFive hundred women scientists it's a grassroots organization that aims to promote diversity in the field and it was set up just off to the election of President Trump in twenty sixteen today of twenty thousand people have signed up to Ames, Iowa last ... years what groups object is originally political\nIt's not political it is about creating equity in the sciences it's about all of the collective inequities that women face and that can be from having someone tell you you're a girl so you're not any good at math\nOr are you sure you should be in this class are smart enough to be here and that comes pretty early on through high school and maybe in your early college years once you get into grad school not only are people questioning whether or not you should be there and your intelligence and if you weren't degree has been good enough\nBut then they started to question your leadership skills and whether you can be in charge of students or projects\nAs you move farther into your career there are paid discrepancies and we started originally just wanting support front end signatures as a ... we had a pledge and we have that on line still you can read it it's quite nice tell us what the pledges it is an open letter that\nWe wrote as the women in science asking scientists women and supportive of women scientists to stand together and change the face of science as it is today\nWe have a signature on a pledge from over one hundred countries so we have over twenty thousand people who signed a pledge\nAnd what did you how to take this we have\nTo be a fully funded sustainable organization that continue to push\nTo make science open explicit and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists though at five in our women scientists within America are succeeding than we want to make five hundred women scientists within all the countries of the world and then five hundred women scientists within each discipline but our preference for Mr Right we can keep moving up and up\nKelly Ramirez than what Kelly and don't you just wait say suggest as a structural problem with science in academia\nBut women are also just not as visible last week professor Dona strict and became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize for physics and they led to another one from this on old won the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nAnd despite professor strict in historic achievement\nHer biography was conspicuously absent from the world's fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on Rebecca get is a ... in history of science at the University of can't she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nAbout how science developed and how it's find a space within rooted culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy it was it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... ... it wasn't necessarily pick the well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to ... to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing is I'm Sorry to say\nI'm One of the ways to do that has often being to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or an intelligent because of the way that gender roles\nOf being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded why they may once the ...\nAnd ... because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding women lead to more authority absolutely and particularly when she got to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public face so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a muscular and kind of ... ... is going on and on owning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we were talking\nNineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a uh Korea policy can follow so a a kind of a job that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish and\nAnd uh reached by what she can expect one living so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite they told him\nAnd by that point ... women are much being excluded from those of you\nAny starkly zone pools if we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places like that happens so the role of searching granted she's one of those places where you might be living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing a geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing I thought you know finding people doing scientific research within universities for example so yeah it's really only later on that you get the kind of scientific career that we would understand that if someone says she paid to do ... particular problem\nIs is pretty much across the ... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe ... I'm very much talking about the\nWestern European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America older I'm interested in these are all more opportunities for women in what is a very new university system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach astronomy in women's college so I was in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a noble system\nAnd often novelty gifts room for women I mean potty often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there in a way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to opt for the Cambridge in England and women's struggling for very long time to be given places\nThat I didn't see the thing that you say that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I could like interesting that in when you look at the desk and I think is on women in science for example the some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nIf we didn't have mobile phones and those days we only had a land line and she runs the police but the police didn't come\nHome in yesterday's ... for the uh going I mean\nAnd I think she right at least two or three times that the police income and then when the manic finished when they wrecked a God they left they moved on to the next family\nSo that though you say effectiveness\nArmy for civil [noise] awesome man here\nThat there was no one from the authorities not from the police know from social services nobody from the church and that was no one to offer support they just wanted us out or that they saw all the people at the newspapers right about they wanted us out of town as simple as that they want you to appeal community\nBarbara ... gets a how to ground mothers who also lived in your in shaping\nThe law on that that has so the morning after all this happened my father said we had to go and make sure the older members of the family are okay\n[noise] so we went fast to his mother's house and when we got family could see that but do I think smashed in and when it got inside out grandmother had been beaten ... she was really scared\nAnd the youngest children he he was around ... still live at home and he had been so frightened that heat jumped to ... states when I'm broke and he's like\nSo my dad had to drive into the dumpsters I had to look after my grandmother and Carol tests that they can ... smashed up her living room it was only piece\nBob are so she thinks the local press was partly to blame for what happened\nAs a dog ... on the air\nAnd newspapers read off because every day that ... ... the mood in the town and that's why people joined up with a group of men who went around cracking people the papers made sure at feeding ... with Catholic and stuff\nAfter several ties the violence peaches out but for nine year olds bitter gets a summer was over usually that have been out from the ... but that's yeah ...\nMillion more now and again and they saw we were worried about the old people that's what we were thinking about it so we stayed in town that summer that wasn't usually what we did\nThe members of those few terrifying dies in the summer of Nineteen forty eight I'll still alive\nItself the is enough for a ... that were sent over there\nIt's left its mark on my cell and that mock is still there\nSeveral people were given prison sentence this is the results of the days of unrest and you don't show up in a large sum of a sudden since we're from the very community which has been victimized moving sixty years later in twenty fourteen a memorial to the violence was unveiled in the town some some\nTwenty Eighteen Barbara ... gets a received an award from the ... in recognition of the work challenging intolerance\nAbout sex from this edition of witness with me to ... ... if you'd like to listen to more of a history programs the raw hundreds available online just such full BBC witness\nOr listening to Ninety point one W.

reassuring of ... when the economy they aren't so who is the enemy of the people ask them\nKinda kinda actually afford at this point to to increase spending\nWell uh I think that the oldest average
