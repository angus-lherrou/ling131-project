shatter needs to redo the\nThing I just thought what can I throw in a a different elements all of this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now from say at the civil rights movement to the sixties simply that many more people have access to these ideas have\nAccess to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that what we're grappling with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is on American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't possible\nYourself as a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character the conversation that's being had on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth\nTo white identity politics\nIs it the ... that actually is destructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there is a fending off it is one that has been set up by the majority [noise] this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests them all in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim\nNarratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims [noise] what was seen the ad is loss of privilege being coded as oppression and that's the difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that no loss of ... which is outrageous so is\nThat rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technical\nIt can lead spinning abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and nothing none of his very healthy it's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... all why was that\nThat doesn't ah to see him if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some not recognized\nAs vets exactly in fact what the debate team movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize that what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what after sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation\nBut there is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with ... come and go into sort of dramatic life story they have no spot us\nUm I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't it problematic that this round protecting this has to find a white wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride was saying\nWho cast if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was pots of a left\nBut some of food that was problematic ... size leave for me\nIs the crux of a disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably ...\nI didn't see politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up\nI find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy wrong call on I've never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life\nWho even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNot allowed to bring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to comments on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful is\nOn a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody crossed\nYou're a white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not ugly or I didn't get life why because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the difference is defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out and it should be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out she's that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus in this shouldn't be warm\nBut the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other defense is somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do you live ... I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic handwringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get unless black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nFeel that there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the staff affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people [laughter]\nNowhere near proportional into academia for instance I feel affirmative action is obsessing but it does that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality where the facts what is the ...\nWhere the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really said it's just that city as reverse sexism\nThe point is that racism and sexism are about Alice tucked okay so you can't really punch up well you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally\nYeah Sherman races so a few points here first the Ford unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and an amongst you have to ... somewhat above the feelings of the majority because I've always voted for people like Donald Trump and but as a disaster for everybody especially for the most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together as a society and help us fight discrimination Robert ... and so the reason to cabbage and feelings of people is but in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a police officer Caitlin facts\nWe can't we can't and French law is and the name of field\nI think I'm I'm Talking about in countries like the other thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think is actually accurate and Vince I ended up so to find a counter that we have different kinds of hard to know what I Would say that well actually I thought you know Donald Trump\nAnd I was in my mouth and finished are bringing about Trump precisely shows what the problem is with conception of politics but says we're going to fight for our group and for our side and we don't care about anything else Priya\nSo we shouldn't have a son have action\nBecause that upsets white beat those are the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised group fair access to write in order that the majority and not be hooked\nOutside but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including a vast majority of people of color in the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on behalf of camps you I Want to move away from that point and bring you in age and we were talking\nAbout this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies actually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like the\n[noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites the establishment simply on representative\nThat often very smoothly groups and yes often watch groups but then ... groups which actually bend bring about the system is unjust almost a father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot ... wide working class\nPopulations in certain countries that have simply not being the winners of globalization all you know open borders and and and all the kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that case um I like the W. W. see either white working class is a very interesting construct\nWhat looks off as as a whole have not done well on the working to offer as as a whole on not white that they could white people but they're all looking classes were being at the shop end of ... near liberalism of capitalism\nIf pressed their ... because they're looking for not because they're white\nThere was no evidence to tell us that the white looking classes are doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working\nClass which is an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in the valley area what happened that as a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of it the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been hemorrhage face the greens on one side and the anti immigrant AFDC on the other\nMeanwhile the S. P. D. which is a leftist sent about ... ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say hey if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into those but\nI think now because the mainstream parties on all things something that's inclusive enough they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the Washington have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against us sanctions quote and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much is less than ... ... I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say we only ever look at the most depressed people in the early ... Massa and an Indian everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the wise approach in Wilson a rational utility maximizing preaches we all people who are involved each we're people embedded in\nInstitutions in that sense feelings do methane his age or the longing into place to people to communities and countries much as we can all today that feeling out of politics or the obvious question that followed from that has been loaning the who onto west and east\nParts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense it on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland uh after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact\nThat's a boring observation and northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you a\nPre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps\nSorry Ken I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with logic ...\nIt's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into small groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away\nBut it but it's all politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't know I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off as a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ... and\nThe question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner but one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of lost twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated hop wild feast of nationalism to try and claim as ... to make it inclusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it is a level of magic kingdom of looking at it states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all the different groups under the common identity\nBut how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nAnd they don't want that to play a very large role in our lives at all and at the moment I think the vision that society which has his double freedom is W ... it's ...\nFrom the radical right it's ... some people are like Donald Trump who want to discriminate you don't want to recognize people have different skin causing them this these as equal but it's also affecting from people who say\nEverything his identity everything's going to be your top national belonging and us no getting away from that\nAsian is that how you use it a a a democracy that threaten from the radical right on the radical left\nAlmost certainly is that it's also threatened by that kind of a hype liberalism that says that we're just all ruthless isolates individuals or nothing in common with anyone else so we we want to I think generally lemonade older as extremes\nAnd get back to the conversation about belonging about the things that we haven't come and his workers as men and women and people of other you know orientation as people leaving the same places as citizens I think it's that conversation about blowing up masters rather than\nYou know keep on emphasizing all the differences in saying that somehow we can imagine some sort of utopia without no distinctions all or we'd have differences in in in roles whatsoever I'm according for liberal extremism whatsoever that itself is ... ... what I'm calling for as a society that recognizes people for the different roles and talents implications\nEnded affords public you know dignity to everyone and dignity means being respected fool the sorts of rules you play for the relationships you have not being forced into warm identity oh into just being a inoculations vigil\nPriya very briefly ... is that the world you're championing a hyper liberal one where everybody that goes back into that separate identities\nHotly I don't think anything sets today has um attended in that direction and in fact I've I've no idea who these mystical people are who've been planning this I think what we need to be looking at quite simply it's who has wealth and power and who is in fact inflicting suffering and\nExploitation on other people and focus on that an Oscar real questions instead of having a false debate about how people who wants to be able to use women's boxing as let's say are uh you know a responsible for the rise of races that might not just a\nA a really kind of surreal discussion that we have sometimes at the expense of looking at actuality it's not no Shriver\nWell as a novelist and they'd person\nUm I get concerned that the identity politics in much like that just that last comment is now tracking us into a world where we think all that matters is human hierarchy\nThat that's the only conversation we ever have identity politics has been very concerned of course with who's privileged who's on top who's been more disadvantage\n... you know life and the world\nAre bigger than that and I don't want to live in that in that space\nWant to be able to talk about architecture\nAnd all that so that's it for this week

gender social status class at background everybody was support and everybody and everybody runs together and and you know that that sends out the message for me when I when I think of Afghanistan over the last ten Fifteen Years\nAnd so how different was not from the Iraqi Mars went on to some ... miles on both of which also done\nAnd it was it was very different um I I think I'm the only three ... three runs brought their own challenges whether that was from security whether it was some environmental factors whether it was the heat and ... at the same time all three things at a similarities as well because\nIt was like anywhere in the ... I'm a I think most people when you visit another country whether that says a soldier or civilian you you're always push by the people you may and for me the project was about children and helping them access to education and all three of these countries are incredible stories of humanity\nThat incredible people and it was an absolute pleasure to to go back with me I was I felt so welcomed in all three of these countries in\nYou know all we we often hear from the western media that these are countries that we shouldn't go to that we should stay away from these too dangerous but I can sit and they say that my experience that was\nAs good as any holiday I've been in the west\nCoast you know how does being a soldier um was served in Iraq and in Northern Ireland for the British forces how does it prepares you for running a milestone in places like um of context on Somalia Iraq\nI think that as a former soldier you know your fingers you used to operate in hostile environment so ... you're not naive to the cops the security risks and the dangers\nI'm a soldier was while you're expected to be physically fit\nAnd you also up you know originally a mindset you know you you know that there's going to be challenges and it's about how you money to deal with those challenges which which ultimately as most than\nHaving traveled the world as a soldier met lots of people it taught me to be respected everybody regardless of whether they come from told me to respect that religion that culture and I think you know in all three of these countries I I did my best to\nUh to respect the people in in in certain people respected me and I think that goes for anyway you go in the world if you show respect you will get respect and you know those countries into different\nWell next briefly\nAnd I'm so next next year I'm going to be rowing dangerously or I'm going to be a will for them\nBut I'm going to row across the bottom up strikes which is the gateway to the Gulf of Aden I'm so we can ... another dangerous region and by pirates and rebels in Yemen than at other people um I've ever been affected in recent years\nWell it's really good to talk to Jordan thank you very much and good luck with everything that you're doing [noise]\n\nNice day on the b._b._c.

you a little bit about why you started\nIs because in China there are no a publicity about anti sexual harassment\nWas the last I saw a we are going out to uh do across funding to abide and that but because of the censorship can I'll do that and so I use my body as a media to promote a anti sexual harassment content\nExplain exactly what you mean by that ... ...\nYeah yeah yeah I I I bought a billboard whatever what what what wherever I go so I I go outside I bought\nMy billboard and there is a ... message on the billboard can you can you tell us maybe about a typical message or it's about um maybe says actually it's not your excuse to harass other people and when you um have a sexual harassment\nI'm ill or the way you should do like a you should go to the police should go to the uh we'll miss federation\nYeah and that kind of message\nAnd when you're walking around town with this message on this very visible message of your your statement how people react to that\nPeople actually into Anna ... they don't like ... react really in a big way they just stacked sneak around I see yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [noise]\nBut in a way a are you are you saying that you're not

the possess or the dealer and several dealers behind him where they got the peace and how to get it back to the church\nThat's Chris Marion hello one of the people who played a key role in returning the stolen sculpture to save a less to London He's the CEO of a recovery international demand to cool when up what goes missing he's even been dubbed the shuttle homes of off looted by the Nazis\nWith a lot of arm twisting in a little bit of threatening litigation we managed to convince to possess or to voluntarily give it back\nTo the church I can imagine that the people you who's on you're twisting a very very reluctant that's right I mean do they know most of the time that they are in possession of stolen all they knew it was dodgy\nOkay they claimed that they bought the piece from a you Cade dealer who was specializing in sculpture when in fact we discovered that this dealer was actually arrested for smuggling cocaine inside of sculptures\nAnd it was the threat of a BBC story they were covering it at the time that convinced this dealer to relinquish the sculpture but it's it's a significant loss presumably if money on the deal is signed well you know what money really didn't change hands they traded\nThings amongst themselves to get the peace up to a value of about fifty thousand pounds which is what they demanded before they voluntarily\nRelease the work but we refuse to pay them I Try to beat them down with the law and morality to return the object without demanding\nSome sort of payment on what works best a mixture of vote independent who you're dealing with I mean I've dealt with some pretty feisty people where they only resort is going to the court system\nBut that's always a last resort why is it was last week though 'cause it's expensive time consuming embarrassing to the dealers to collectors that to their name becomes public and there are a lot of judges that don't know a pecan also from their elbow so it's something we try to avoid\nAnd when you say you twist I'm [laughter] I'm just trying to imagine that kind of conversation how ... what we're the art world Sixers\nPeople come to us and say look I've got something that I Know it was stolen I don't want to be arrested I I don't want my name in the paper I Want to cooperate and get rid of it can you help me and we\nAre asked to keep things out of the press\nIn exchange for cooperation which is something we can offer to go to the price is one of your ways of all I have faith that we use it as a weapon and sometimes name and shame they have slowly I mean there are people who are well heeled individuals for bold faced names that have stolen and looted works of art in their collections and they do not want to be ...\nThat must be loads of pieces out that that you would like to see recover to that what what type of illness well I represent\nThe heirs of the dealer Paul Rosenberg who's gallery was looted by Herman Gehring himself in Paris in Nineteen forty there are over sixty top paintings missing since Nineteen forty and I know where some of them are I Know where one of them is right now in switched\nAnd there's a very uncooperative dealer in Hamburg\nI Would like to get back piece back so in that particular reason why is that dealer refusing to cooperate and why have fuel threats not with the well he sold it to his client so he knows he's on the hook for the money if it was quite has to give up the painting\nHe's going to have to reimburse a significant amount of money that's why he doesn't want to cooperate it's all about greed it's all about money\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Nazi looted works of art still out there in the marketplace perhaps six seven hundred thousand objects and not all top ... but you know tourists roles and other important religious objects that are just gone [noise]\nSo is the ... will do you think doing enough to stop this or you can find a lot of people coming here and praise the big auction houses ... afraid to criticize them because they are so powerful\nBut I'm not one of those people the major auction houses maintain\nRestitution departments to make sure that Nazi looted works of art are researched and they and funneled through the auction house so that they can earn commissions on sale the auction houses help facilitate deals between victims and possesses of Nazi looted works of art\nSo that they can sell it through the auction house so they've got a vested interest do Chris Marietta that may be but the auction house Christie's did help Sylvie ... Sylvie describes itself as just a French woman living somewhere in the south of France\nHer grandfather though was Alfred wine bug a prominent ... Paris in fact he was such a respected authority that during the war the Nazi general hunting and gathering wanted to employ Mr Weinberg to verify the auto he'd looted\nWeinberger refused and so the Nazis pills that his art collection too but last month off to Seventy is a painting from his collection to women and a garden Byron while was finally returned to Sylvie Christie's in New York\nThe ... you know say that the ... and that's where the Nazis told them most of them were found after the war that we're still paintings missing five hundred watt including the one I received back in New York\nWere you aware that this one particular painting had been missing all alone\nNo never I never heard about this story\nThe war was a taboo subject I supposed that's when my grandfather died you would never expect we could find his painting so long afterwards and he died I was Fifteen so I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things off to my mother died now I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that there were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... what did it must have been quite a shocking revelation\n[laughter] yes it was a huge shock\nAnd awe after a few weeks I've been told that the reds vi was investigating on the property of the painting and the American government decided that it's your painting so they going to give it back to you\nSo I was a yes\nYou did not know that it belonged to you I mean hasn't made you more curious to go and look what are the religion of property there is that belong to a grandfather\nWhat we know actually about the five other paintings\nBut I've got an everyday life and honestly I'm not living with that kind of idea I think I'm already been very lucky to get one back but you can't do it when you you can't keep this particular painting unfortunately not\nBecause the French government compensated for the paintings so as I have it back I have to give the government the money back\nWhich made you how to know who's going to raise the money to do that\nExactly yes yes\nAm quite disappointing few I mean so keeping it in you\nFamily is no longer an option even though it's been written\nTo you know it's not an option and fortunately of course I Would have loved to keep it because it's a huge symbols for me and my sanity but that's life\nSylvie ... said the painting had been on a Seventy year old is he from South Africa to London to Switzerland in New York before a gallery called talk west in Florida bullshit from some of these pop west in tents sold it to a private collector and money can spot it was not see looted up\nIt says it prompt the compensated that by it but the gallery is now in ten seeking compensation for subtleties with no luck so far pose sweat is the ... gallery\nSubsidies were selling it at auction so they can try and obtain their relief from whoever gave the peace to them but the idea that it's park west that should you know suffer the financial loss when we acquired in good faith from ... they represented the provenance of the piece to be on blemish them without question\nPark west pay good value for the peace so everything about purpose transaction where subsidies was arm's length in good faith were park west\nWould have had no notice no knowledge does know wasn't any red flag whatsoever that would have clued park west and to the fact that this was actually stolen from the Weinberger family by the Nazis database\nSomewhere that tells you which pieces of art a stone Leno or considered you know suspect in some way\nThankfully there is unhelpful either database did not list this piece in two thousand or\n... it's a common occurrence I mean does it happen quite a lot that you come across he says by famous artists who he kind of wonder where it came from\nNo no it's unusual and it's my understanding that the Weinberger airs only became active

with a ton of on on behalf of the United nations so how does he think these elections will go\nThe best hope is that they pass off relatively peacefully on there is a ... an agreed outcome people can agree on who got elected to the parliament but there is a very real risk that the elections will be messy because\nThose who are trying to run the elections are facing an incredible task\nMuch of the country is controlled by the Taliban\nThe console pulling their this means that turnout may end up being much lower than in previous elections but it also can introduce distortions into the allocation of seats are for example there in a province if\nIt's insecure in one area and relatively secure in another area than if the people only vote in one part of the province only their representatives are going to get elected to parliament and that's going to give a sense of disenfranchisement what's\nLife like for Africans living in the Taliban controlled territory\n[noise] in many places I think people have concluded that if you keep your head down don't challenge the Taliban have no dealings with the government you'll be okay\nBut the chances of getting on in life the chance of doing the kinds of things that well people in poor places off the do try to get a job in the city working with the government those options are all cut off\nAnd is a Taliban controlled area a Taliban Renee area by which I mean all their services can you live a life get a job feed your children\nWell certainly the Taliban have a rudimentary administration but it's not like a normal government they have an administrator that they put in sort of in charge of a each district there were four hundred districts in the country oh they basically trying to your presided over law and order\nAnd a lot of districts in Afghanistan\nThe way it works is that the administrative headquarters and a circle with a radius of about maybe half a kilometer around it is controlled by the government and that's where the government administrator sit so there's a security posts a small contingent of Afghan police and then the villages are controlled by the Taliban\nSo by that reckoning I think we can say that over half the national territory is currently one way or another in Taliban hands\nMichael Semple well NATO has more than fourteen thousand\nTroops in Afghanistan they're not involved in combat operations [noise] so what are they doing I spoke to kind of ... painters he's German and he speaks on behalf of the NATO resolute support mission in Afghanistan\nOr support mission of NATO is a non\nCombat mission so we are not deploying troops anyway in this country NATO will not have a role on Saturday the whole security is the hands of the Afghan police and they ask an army the African national defense and security forces [noise]\nThe Taliban are beginning to say at least some who are negotiating in different ways with western diplomats that\nThey would tolerate some kind of a NATO presence can you foresee the Taliban having some involvement in government and they're still being western troops though\nIf I could see that to be serious that will be fought me on my pay grade and that's you know NATO is not involved in this negotiation\nBut I'm guessing that you might have worked in other parts of the world where former enemies become political I suppose pot and that was to try and bring conflict to an end\nI or your right to different parts of the whole before but I don't dare to speculate here in Afghanistan Afghanistan is a very special place wall toll on for more than forty years already\nThe crossroads that we are at right now requires the title of um at first to take a serious decision which way are they to go all day going forward towards a political settlement or will they stay on the path of\nViolence and committed a horrible acts against the civilian population over here\nAnd I typed spokesman ... pets as well what is it that the Taliban one one kind of peace might be Strunk I've been speaking to Pablo Acosta would almost you know he's secretary general of hogwash which is a Nobel Peace prize winning peace prize winning organization has been talking to the Taliban in the country capital do ... for a number of years\nBut they're not even want the key word is end of the nation namely withdrawal for the first is of course they usually they must use these ... things that they've been fighting for say Seventeen years plus to eliminate the presence of for influence from getting\nThey also said that they want to cook or a week for the new ...\nThey said they don't want to have the political power\nThey say that again when I was sitting duck we need to do the Afghans want is to put him in any agreement with the United states\nSo could you foresee an agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government would leave the Afghan government in control\nWhat is most difficult since if you as a ceasefire which I think as anybody loans than these remained at a time when we stay where they are so they are not going to surrender and the East African government classical ... to surrender then I think they're going nowhere\nBut the Taliban has such a different view of the future of Afghanistan any cease fire they might cool would probably be temporary because they surely believe they can win the whole of the country\nWell I think there is to Seventeen years there is a growing release that no one can win the Americans and the government need to talk to\nI think it's high time to concede the mediation any way of of ah going get along with being peaceful situation\n[noise] ... that are messy enough from hogwash the Nobel Peace prize winning organization talking to the Taliban were listening to that in our studio here in central

indication that listening to the optimism in Palo credit or I'm just you know from ... talking about the Taliban would accept a ceasefire that they would work with the Afghan government shoulder
