think ... haven't been care about the only thing they were probably ... that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to start somewhere and perhaps they're trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd is this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if there's even a fast food night rainy they vote yeah they they had some people the rest of it I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid about two grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game\nUm yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating and games and like many things he gets in the video games journalist joining us life\nLewis retreating and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit mono a twenty two minutes possibly about Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana consumption on site you regard was pushed the protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck\nFirst Newfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country to be moving across to great celebrations ... of Neil Young each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation balls that in the provincial capital syndrome as midnight struck so who was selling the first batch\nIt's a company called our calls canopy gross it's actually whiter a large multinational company and they set up shop in St john's so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are about three locations here in in St john's area that\nYou could walk in off the street by the candidate but for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd they brought in older roles of regulation companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that can set resort in the province right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government for a\nWhile it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies have their eye on this already and we've got in first that if the company that already um that had already set down the\nWith down Bruce in other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move a midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and seems that you're seeing the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and said this excitement tonight is is quite amazing\nThough I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities but really for people some of them are Canadians of wanted this for very long time and ah when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers and uh and regulated in an attempt to\nTo grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidate to see what Canada is going to do because Eric way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bumps that hiccup from law enforcement to actually what\nEven now marijuana one thing we inherited the last number of days that they expect that demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of flyers are probably going to run out even within the first day\nAll right because it's such a stampede the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nBut before Johan moved to America for these studies he started a bond with these friends back home and Sweden cold the family tree\nWhile I was in Boston we've got a record deal\nSo I had to you know just what I Want to do so I went out and we went on tour here in Sweden in India and you're and landmark known just like Sweden Denmark or and then I got fed up on tour and then started thinking how can I make a living being a musician\nBeing in a studio which is my favorite place on earth and a happy accident this guy and knew he reached out out of the blue hey do you want to do some using for computer game yeah [laughter] a\nLittle bit Johan knew that this introduction to the work of composing for computer games would lead to his music being haired all over the world candy\nCrush saga is obviously a huge\nMassive yeah in fact I've got written ... year one point seven billion downloads so far it's a lot of people that's a lot of people yeah so you're probably the most played composer from the world at the moment could be\nNot by choice though [laughter] I just happen to be there [noise]\nWhat you're eating with some of my work from time to Nabil a TV show that as being broadcast and two hundred and twenty countries and watched by an estimate the audience of a hundred and twenty million people the potential audience for ... work is many times thought\nA staggering number of people can access he's music at the top of a screen and I couldn't wait to hear more about his creative process but first I wanted to understand more about how Johan worked alongside the rest of the developing king of\nThe game has sometimes more than one producer that you know their main focus is to make sure it's a great game yeah but when we talk about me recording studio whatever I'm the executive producer regarding the music the music itself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ... ... this is the music we're going to use\nWell the one of the producers is my main contact that's the same procedure for every game and as soon as we establish some sort of\nHappiness if ... if I could you know if they're concerned with the material they're getting from me I always want to have the final say I always want to feel free so I'd say you're going to get something like this right but\nYou basically they they all old Ki ay direction and then you're free to yeah to go with it I mean that's very that's the law freedom it is\nAnd I'm not sure that's like normal procedure but that's how I've done it and I haven't asked questions music such a difficult thing to talk about it or if\nYou're not a musician a year or juice or or a director and you meet somebody that you can create a language that they can both understand about music that then you're all ... really and that's what that's like really\nReally tough yes some producers game producers know some about music some have a big interest and are very interested in no you know they might even play the guitar or something and you know the vocabulary\nBut some have no clue whatsoever and I said send me a Spotify YouTube link to something similar your you know you're imagining my products kind of found I can\nI joined us on a few days after you've received he's three for jelly Saigon and he was a ... to start on the first time he'd spoken to the game producer\nAnd he was looking for inspiration for me starting off every job is a bit of a nightmare the blank sheet of blank page with nothing\nOn I live in ... yeah surely you must be a time we spend a day writing and never come up with anything I always hear the music in my head and I follow that thing that I hear [noise]\nSit back and\nKnow that was it ... reaching to kind of get into that a lot more to walk and sometimes need to take a break just go out for a walk\nSo we did just start you on that I wouldn't for strolls\nSo there are quite a few people here I've noticed carrying I put some headphones and things of things do you ever see that\nI listen to a lot you know at at home a lot when I turned on Syria [noise] to to music or nor me in the car and on walks and if a bicycle I normally indifferent to spoken word from my life but I Am do or\nListen to certain compose this or musicians to you know get inspiration [noise] I guess not trying to steal anything or so but I like movies have at least\nOne of my favorites yeah regarding the audience ration and yeah and stuff you find you go through phases of outgoing listening to different people and getting going yeah yeah I I get like yeah I get\nStuck with one person for a band or something and then I just listen to that that person for three four months and then I'm sick of it and then I Move on the thing but then it goes in cycles so one of my you know the biggest [noise]\nIdol is prince yeah he was a hard time Mozart sort of the biggest ...\nPrints have come up for a few times in our conversation which wasn't a surprise considering ... studying from ... university and playing the genre with these bonds onto her and I started walking the park continued it became clear important this background wars for finding inspiration\nThings pop up my head can be added on a\nA a could just be that it was something I just get my phone [noise]\nPush record and da da da da and normally I said some like it coming like come out that this was the vows to San Diego to put a display that it that well below awesome show\nTest them more meaning it adds some or all Bowen and clarinet or something of food and then in the play something with interest is in three for your call tough three or thoughts thirds yeah\nSo yeah and I ...\n... when I hear the music I hear more than I have like ... and stuff so I but I can just seeing one [laughter] I think the middle east and I you know make memos of what\nHear so you build up a ... and then the ah the when you go to the studio in the morning to you kinda listen back to the mall how'd you always remind yourself of one of these things are kind of they have folders though my Google Drive let's see if I can find at Santa\nA lot of stuff [noise] home has could not meant to this could be\nA mess but it's also a British soccer and because the decision that's made scene string parts of the U.S [noise]\nJohan was ready to start doing these ... and that's I sat next to him in the studio I noticed something that was very strange to me when I can pose I watched the moving image I get to field a performance and understand or the producers of the film or tea program when the audience to react\nYou on was composing are looking at any images he played a quick damage game when he's ... and and just started his work [noise]\nSomething like that I tried to play to this [noise]\n\nUh yeah they just like with one harm neither um [noise] and then I and [noise]\nI guess to park army [noise]\nAnd um you know getting

you feel [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm I Can't do anything about it I'm fine with it but hearing you mean when you put it that way it feels like a ...\nTotally I did have the music on and but I Would\nThink that anyway but ah yeah that I put down some effort to it I guess and uh\nYeah I Would hope they appreciate them\nYou know doesn't upset that\nPeople will occasionally\nNo I mean it's their\nDecision it's their own loss that experience as a whole is Dale and audio and they have the whole ... [noise] um [noise]\nBut I don't get upset I get it\nPresumably I mean people switch you off not necessarily because they don't like the music\nISIS within which they're playing the game last\nNight at telling myself but it's Saturday but I I'd say I you know you have to be honest I mean if you play the game and I've\nI've got so much nights you know nice comments from people from all of the world loving the main thing and then that that really warms my heart but you got to be honest and if you have the same three minute three thirty whatever it is music and you play that game for that say hundred two I threw out three hundred hours or so\nYou will end up getting that other there's no way avoiding it yet but you know I I Try my best to [noise]\nMake you feel good as long as possible [noise]\nHappy to have this cools studio as [noise]\nYou know I have to you know ... sometimes I enter this real this is my office\nLike being here are still I liked the freedom this job crates I mean I it's it's a fast you know\nSometimes yeah I go out get creativity from nature or whatever and I feel I've ... I've got to opportunity to do that here or\nNo one bothers me or complaints as long as I deliver 'em some quite content I Hope that will stay here I could say for the rest of my life but as long as I work I Would love to hear\nI Can't imagine [noise]\nSomething better than this so creative and\nI get to do what I Love which is for me [noise]\nYou've been listening to in the studio with you on homes from\nI'm drawing London and this has been an audio all was production by Chelsea Dickinson ...

you're not allowed to do that now with one of these machines\nThat is true but we think both of the air traffic control and the technology and the regulations will catch up to the developments that you know the the regulations always lag technical development so uh we think that that eventually catch up and there'll be guidelines and rules that will allow people to fly in urban urban is\n...

Steve right he's associate professor in aerospace engineering at the University of west of England I met some of the current obstacles\nThat are holding back the regulate this\nIt is say well in the case of high technology is the things that look easy at home and the things a low cost a easy so books are blocked writing a high rise environment that's too bad\nMuch of the problems in fact pretty ... pretty good the biggest problem we call ... ... ... can we cram into a box say we engineer as we've been spoiled rotten for the last hundred and fifty is by the ... ... and ... and feel\nThere's a huge amounts of energy enough that can give us a huge in here and it had to fly for several hours that the ... technology we've got ... the ... and is there any good for about half an hour oh sweet cool the now so that doesn't give us the safety margins that we've been somebody within the past\nSo in other words they performance that we say is actually the issue is trying to make that happen

year or two\nCould double latte flying time all the same some of those involved in driving than you tack like engineering ... era uh playing it safe and now using hybrid technology to power that threatens\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an onboard generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade to batteries as soon as the battery technology is there describe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or\nParis if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted\nVersions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that very goes developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think that the taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably in the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have passed laws regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully right now today in ...\nThere are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city busy business people five to ten times a year\nWe all find ourselves in the cities where okay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and ... by ... that saying but I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and lost like attack so you\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three
