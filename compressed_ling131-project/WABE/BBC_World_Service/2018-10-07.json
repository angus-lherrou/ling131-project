Democrats which makes it very difficult to force them to take control of the Senate they were hopeful because\nIn previous being much more likely to say they weren't city after\nAbout voting this fall then Republicans were Republicans now thinks that they have an issue that I Will raise Republican enthusiasm and in fact in a lot in the economist you go to the polls in the last week the percentage of Republican met\nAnd in particular enthusiastic about voting this year than usual rose eleven points looted from a large change\nIn a very short period of time uh Democrats have been enthusiastic Democrats have been I'm ed ... turning out in um special elections and in primary elections and [noise]\nAnd so now it and I think we have a little a week or two of uneasiness we really do have to wait another week or so to see this monolith continues um oh Henry falls back now that Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed that they can be seen on the Supreme Court\nSome ... ... I'm going to have one I'm going to last ... for a moment while I get some comments from the studio and also because the line is a little shaky between you and I was ... when you look at\nHow this much ... what what comes to mind for research to our surprise to hear the ... the events motivated the Republicans mostly a as we know America's usually don't show up in hard numbers for electric generically\nAnd the Democrats more motivated and during the Republicans but now it seems that this is motivated the Republicans\nWhich means I Would think that they will go towards a more conservative\nView in the mid term elections than we were expecting from previous reports and as a hour specials just mentions it looks like the Democrats will probably take over the house of representatives\nBut in ... there are a little girl and the and the Senate\nOr the Russia [noise] yeah I tend to agree actually with a some analysis um [noise]\nI think that uh that I'm Tom is winning more and more than the heart of the ... which is something that was not the case then beginning because of the economic figures he can well I think the economic\nFingers are very important because we have precedent to all the benefits and economic uh up to an end for sure\nThe U.S economy is doing very well now they can do it of course I mean this is an economic size ... because of you who was actually Obama this thought that it is and it sounds is reaping the benefits but that's you know what is happening\nLet me let me go back to countries are dealing with a better line of you you had the remarks caffeine in the studio pick up on on any points you heard\n[noise] I I think one part that's very important to make is that opinion about Donald Trump seems on changing and he has stabilized at an approval rating that's around forty percent it goes up a point or two it goes down upon your two he is benefiting\nFrom what is a very good economy I'm just yesterday in fact\nThe unemployment rate and it was that we've seen in the United states in Nineteen sixty nine\nSo that's that's helping him\nUm I think the problem in looking ahead to the uh the election which is thirty days away it's quite a ways away lots can happen a lot has been happening in the United states [laughter] um\nBut I think the problem is is that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections and um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats um it is\nIt's going to be a state by state results on it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats take control of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIs it also affects the Democrats are clearly against something most obviously Donald Trump but people are less clear about what their full\nI Do think that that's a very good point because\nIt seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear than it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to win\nWhat but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump's they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme Court\nRepublicans have one that fits conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority they're on and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican in Sudan yeah as a would've\nContinued and perhaps even grown over the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument that if the Democrats take control they will teach Brett Kavanaugh I'm so to try to keep that\nConcern that fear at the top of people's minds is one way of making sure that Republicans stay committed um again I I think we can say much more about this in a week or two when we see how opinion has changed now the Kavanaugh is on the court\nSaid thank you very much for coming on a custody in front of you choose a leading expert in public opinion polling in the United states I Know we were talking about the

now feared dead\nI'm Mark what do we know for sure at this stage\n[noise] well they all still allegations Julian at the state so we don't do anything for sure but what we know in terms of the ... uh sources from the government is an initial investigation from techie has found\nThat ... ... who is a prominent Saudi dissidents critic uh all the ah the Saudi Government um is believed to have been killed off to ... and to the Saudi consulate last Tuesday a to obtain documents for his forthcoming wedding ... woman\nNow be tux investigation is saying that I missed the show he was killed in a premeditated murder\nOr some reports suggesting that a team of Fifteen people flew in from Saudi Arabia arrived at a concert last Tuesday hearing assemble some of them were officials and they all believe to have potentially being positive I hit squad\n'em beat tux investigation not saying how they believe he was killed ... that they believe his body was then removed from the consulate building I must say that\nA source of the Saudi Government or an Saudi conceal it hearing assemble us that that the allegations are baseless the Saudi Government is from is maintaining that John ... left the confidence building off to a entering it last Tuesday he if he had he disappeared off the top of that time\nAnd presumably there are ways that either side and couldn't substantiate what they're saying I mean ... TV cameras for example records of some description would surely exist to determine who goes in and out of a building like that\nI mean the ... the country looks I'm allowed in a a team from the Reuters news agency to film inside the building and they said that they are all I'm cameras inside the consulate button they apparently do not actually record\nSo ah quite ... ... one ... one scotch and we've had\n'em but us CCTV from around the constant of buildings so far has not shown any evidence of Mr ... emerging\nA it is though a very heavily fortified building there are numerous entrances and exits um bought a ... at the moment the two sides are all\nCompeting narratives but Julian if if it turns out to be a state sponsored much out of a high profile dissident here on Pakistani soil it would plunge turkey Saudi relations which already strained to an unprecedented\nYes I wanted to highlight that I mean as you say they're not good at the moment I'm an by all means to elaborate on that as to why but in terms of the damage this does diplomatically potentially quite significant is it\nIt's ... I mean one would expect if if it's worth it to be maintained improve and even though the Saudis are denying it and they would that would be severe diplomatic retribution from techie and yes the relationship is stranger than I was on a number of\nIssues tacky at science and with cats over Qatar's blockade by Saudi Arabia and neighboring Arab states tacky supports the Muslim Brotherhood's which has listed in Saudi Arabia is a terrorist organization\nAnd Turkey's ... with Iran which is of course Saudi Arabia is great rival in the region has riled the government in Riyadh so and these are two important powers in the region Saudi Arabia the protector of most of the ... holy sites and on that\nAnd is the next government here in in in in Turkey a ... relationship sort of grew Saudi strong guy but now they all eighties trained on number of issues but but you know this is what you'll be proven\nA murder Josh again it would be it would be a an extremely serious and ... and ... much more than one in the side of relationship that would be an extremely extremely serious town of events fully for the ranks and ship between the two countries\nI think they only had about Fifteen minutes and twenty eleven have warning as well so\nIn which case you are looking to the structure of the buildings that you hope will withstand this\nYeah yeah so it orders to design buildings that we would call sue nominee resilient you need to think about a couple of things you need to think about\nHow high they might be said that high enough to allow people to seek refuge above the water line and how strongly a sudden materials they're made of\nAnd particularly how well founded they go into the bedrock and that's quite important are a lot of the structures from what I've seen and the information that we're catching in that area were built tell them or not necessarily well founded into the bedroom built on sort of soil and sediment layers which may well uh uh\nIf you have a structure and I sort of loose kind of material it's not going to be as resilient to those kind of full says I'm as it would be if it was founded well in the federal\n... what I say clearly maybe you can but you can't necessarily bills every building on to that level but what you do need to do is build enough of big buildings presumably wet people know they go to\nIndonesia so so [noise] excuse me\nExcept for Nike structures dwellings and things like that it wouldn't be economical right um and it wouldn't be socially um except what I Would imagine to ask every person to live in a three story concrete reinforced house on stilts so you need to kind of think about which buildings and\n... there's two types of structure I Would say\nYou need to think about when increasing the resilience of an area so the first one would be a way to people seek refuge\nAnd those structures would only be for that purpose and you could build them outside of um says reinforced concrete and steel Memphis without walls and so you can imagine a structure which is maybe the shell of the building doesn't have any side walls or anything like that it looks like a that a cop hawk or something\nOr and you'd have a sort of the stairway around the side and people would evacuate the roof this building and maybe on the roof you'd have a hotline communications and medical supplies to most of\n'em and the thing about that age is going to be totally enough and be because there are no sidewalks and it's well founded into the bedrock the full civil war to is much less and less Russia most of the ... it's just going to go straight through\n[noise] let me bring my guess it makes them feel it's a question of what's in your mind well I I guess my question is how realistic is it that in a poor country\nYou can do something like that where the resources for that and as part of that question is how realistic is it to imagine not allowing people to build in those dangerous areas and for some somewhere else\nI I wouldn't want to\nEncourage anyone not to live anywhere I think um we like living by the sea it's where are you know\nFor for a number of reasons is also where people make a living it's where they go fishing is where the port so\nYou know most of the ... I Love the world's population live by the ocean so the idea of just saying you can't live in a place it's too dangerous especially actually these things these events I Know we've had sort of three big events now and the last Fifteen sixteen years but that that the relatively rat\nSpeeding unfortunate this sort of two decades so saying that you can't leave the as engineers I think what we want to do is try and encourage the built environment which allows people to live where they want to live in the most safe\nAnd resilient way um some of the structures like an evacuation ... not necessarily expensive um or difficult to build a it just needs to be a well pond and uh\nWell constructed with raw materials in the rye knowledge so it's a lot of this is about getting that knowledge to the people who have building these than destruction in Iraq\n[noise] I think it's a great idea and the main thing that you can be on the towel I like that then you you can have people [noise]\nUh skating to the towel I my question is if you will need to create a system now why do you do is ... ... rounds to make sure\nThat he's going to what the people you know whether they're going to ask because why not do did did did anything like\nOften we at the very high number of victims because people panic Kenya and said do the wrong thing okay so especially in densely populated area so I actually think you know you need to like him\nSuch them today are ranked ... yeah maybe every ... or something\nLike that so that it's time\nConsuming you have to still consuming ... to convene to be able to do it and all that stuff and\nNo I I so I we can advise about the the engineering side of things but the whole idea of resilience is a empowering the population into\nTaking a set of their own responsibility in in that safety and I'm a ... about giving knowledge um are you aware of the evacuation structures which stretches the ones to evacuate to in secret fish to\nA certain time of day maybe every once in a shopping center maybe the shopping center should be designed\nA with them a structural integrity that will make it safe or the schools you know you've got kids in the school is maybe the schools should have a um but it really depends on uh the local authorities and the and societies and ... they they wish\nTo just a brief article so what you mean you mentioned Japan ... other lessons in Japan the people to begin\nTo learn specifically in this area uh yes so I actually visited Japan sort of three years ago to look at some of the reconstruction what they're doing and they were hit very badly by the twenty eleven to lose to nominate of way\nAnd some of the things that they they're doing so the Japanese are builds lots of big engineering they're they're they're really into that big engineering I'm so they build these large walls\nAnd one of the interesting things that I saw that they had a whole villages which were unfortunately uh said watch out a sort of the smaller residential areas\nAnd and that building them in the same place but that building among artificial the reclaimed a hill so I saw the biggest in their piling on lots of debt and soil and

... the south to Spain but actually not I'm from an island in Venezuela called ...\nAnd I didn't even grew up listening to these kind of music I I actually grew up listening to ... nothing like what I Do now but then I just got very interested in this type of music and I think it's because of their honesty and how ... it is you know\nWhen you listen to his music and then I just met ... which is like the perfect person to these kind of music he's like the king of flamingo in Spain so they kind of museum doing is a mix\nOf false music from Venezuela and also you hear traces from Spain and from

saying and much will\nSo this song actually she called me one day from Spain and he's like no I just open the newspaper and the first thing that I saw\nWas the situation in Venezuela a I mean here already knew of course about it uh because one of my family is still there and since we're from a new look from these island it doesn't affect does as much as it ... I guess and I'm Talking about\nFood or a you know crime a but when he read it he said the heat it really touched she's hard and he told me and I just wrote this and he sent me this song and he was like I wrote it I mean I talk a lot about it with him so he knows how I feel\nAbout my family and everything we've been through so they sunk talked to a little bit uh above me wanting to go back I've been away from my country for seven years I left because of my career\nBut of course I miss my family my dad has been hurt me sinking since I left it's been seven years he cannot country tonight estates so he hasn't her missing since I left\nSoda and\nThen it said keep sending\nMoney [noise]\nAnd I actually just went back in March for a concert that I gave in ... and that was the first time after seven years\nWhat was that like during ... to to Caracas about point\nIt was crazy actually because I never go to get as when I visit and I I've been trying to visit at least once a year but this time but it won in March was my first time stopping and ...\nIs very different of course since I left a lot of people has left so actually there's not even traffic actually traffic was as crazy as it is in New York [noise] and it was very very emotional for me because given a concert there with the people you know with my people\nAre and singing a song that it's called ... which is my single where I talk about the island that I'm from and the people that are that lived there it was very touching very touching it was like the first thirty minutes just wanting to cry suits me one of the most beautiful countries have had in my life\nI don't know\nI mean these were cultures that sold out and to move to yeah\nAnd I it was a last minute thing because I was just going to give to Congress in ... and they sold out and then uh one of my friends are using the industry she was like now like you really have to give a concert in ... and I'm like are you are you sure\nYou know people are waiting for you like well let's see and then he was to sold out concerts was a big surprise and a beautiful moment\nI mean the original ... is not to sound surprised that it comes to buy you should be sold out but it sort of culture incorrect ... I was sold out of the Bible\nKnow I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tore because it's not worth it like in\nEconomy side economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they tried to make ... early during the day so they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven PM leaving the theater\nIs there any particular reason why you want to do all this question well at the time I sent the email asking the question I was evacuated for Hurricane Irma and I was in a hotel room in Charlotte North Carolina listening to the radio waiting to see what's going to happen to my\nSo I was listening to crowd science and at the end it said sending your questions and I said well you know how nice would it be if we can avoid this and so I\nSent an email on my phone\nNow from our listeners is dedication emailing cramped science midstream evacuation tackling Kelly's question is the least we could\nShe wants to know if there's any way to take a ...\nAnd we're so glad Kelly write to us mainly because I had the once in a lifetime experience of ... thousand feet to look a hurricane and it's also because in this program we'll be hearing about some of the incredible ways it may be possible to slow down a stew from the ridiculous\nLEDs break a piece of an iceberg and put it in the Gulf of Mexico or down here in the Caribbean and cool the sea surface temperatures to the downright\nDestructive to ... just ...\nDid you see on the satellite pictures like rubber\nBut first to Kelly in question the hurricane she's talking about ... I'm a swept through the southern United States a year ago causing an estimated one hundred billion dollars of damage in title\nOn the Caribbean islands of Bob lead to an antique wins as a hundred and eighty five miles an hour so tens of thousands of people lose their homes\nAnd hurricanes on just a problem here is the U.S for pets to Florence ... back to the Philippines forcing more than ten thousand people to evacuate\nBack in ... Florida Kelly tells me hearken wasn't the first stone she survived in fact she's a bit to the veteran\nMoved to Florida in two thousand and three and in two thousand and four there were three hurricanes that year Charlie\nFrancis and Jean Charlie was the one that change course and you didn't have a chance to evacuate yes and we lived in an apartment on\nI passed right over us and even though it is an inland for a\nIt was still ... mile an\nWins [laughter] we we ... in the master bedroom closet with the cat and we waited it out\nAnd it was almost done and power went out\nAnd it was two days of\nHot and wet\nWhen Charlie went through it was like it was a bomb that only took out trees there wasn't a\nCanopy a on a gas station that wasn't torn off Kennedy do you have to get used to hurricanes you don't get used to it really but you learn to live with that anxiety\nNine times out of ten everything's going to be fine but it's that one time that you have to be prepared for and ready to act on\nIf there's one place getting back to being prepared it's Florida\nUm surprisingly for the state's dumped the hurricane capsule of the world there's a lot of research happening hit into how they work and how to mitigate their effects\nAnd as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we could stop harkens altogether but before that I Want to start with some basics wants a hurricane and how does it for them why there's so many of them here in the southern tip of the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nThey told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means that don't have to pay me it was march in the department of earth and environment her for her to assure university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explains how they form\nHurricane is strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans takes its energy from the warm waters of the sea and hurricanes work work steam engines the ocean as the board or and of course wind blowing around in circles the turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stopped thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert as tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a metaphor but from what the scientists it's more or less true\nMeteorologists always talk about her butterfly flaps its wings at home mom can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car and some of the garlic butter root for days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something\nSo you get Seventy or eighty those during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need ... to that is a very particular recipe\nIn the ocean surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in that water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least is on monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline surely ... is the deputy director of knows hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm theory the purpose of that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening\nThat didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast to go in order that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black clouds pretty much so I mean it only got better for us when we had a satellites\nAnd that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecast what kinds of Tuesday you used to track how can\nWe use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we we launch radio sons bitter weather balloons we have buoys out in the ocean\nOr we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane ... they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives a sort of the reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those us under storms and hurricanes are and you've got on the table\nIn front of us well it looks like a cylinder that you'd poster poster inside what is it\nIt is a drop when San does a GPS drop one son and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with these instruments to our\nHurricane Florence making last fall who would\nKnow somebody might wonder how TV with the full cost us know so much about how storm is behaving I just seemed
