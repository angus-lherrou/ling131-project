conditions are very well described in the book which are old lady but besides that the character's all the characters are fiction and the how to book moves as fiction\nThere's a point during the book and you referred to this several times the theme of silence so the imposition of silence on people what are you getting at when you focus on that specific\nNo actually actually silence is part of ... will they be thrown my experience is that the the victims are but there are side by the drum than they are silenced by city\nThe Palestinian story was never hurt because there was another story which was covering it\nAnd for people who were which means you to the other story was bigger because it was beautiful made that started at the the the articles was done by Europeans and so the whole book is

this step which comes afterwards\n... a major issue here I mean cervical check had done this all just a look back on every case of cervical cancer diagnosis to see what the original slide reviewed had found so they reviewed over three thousand cases\nThat old has had essentially been done for educational purposes and as well as well intentioned but very poorly managed so women weren't told their slides had being reviewed and critically that in certain ... two hundred and Twenty one cases they might have benefited from an earlier a diagnosis or a different intervention\nSo that initial group of two hundred and Twenty one women are families were identified by the health service we now know that twenty women have died but we don't know the cause of death in all cases\nSome women died without ever knowing about this or this\nSurvey go check had told some doctors that several women shouldn't be told\nThat a false negative results have been identified in disorders there was a dispute of sorts between cervical track headquarters in Dublin and doctors and hospitals around the country at the who should actually have responsibility for protecting the women doctors who would not being involved in this all just\nSome of them didn't feed it was their job to be telling women that perhaps mistakes have been made by others but not by them\nSo it was the reason that they knew by then they had cancer that time has passed and time had moved on said those abnormal cells that are being seen on the initial Smith had been developed into cancer\nYes I mean that that's correct also the way some women were told is also an issue the subsequent inquiry found there'd be an uh what they said was a ... paternalistic culture by conditions\nThat some doctors told patients of the issue in a very hard for them and defense away the report your quotes from various women voting coups quotes like doctor said what difference would it make\nOne woman asked how would I be informed from now on I was told by her doctor watch the news\nAnd then also one consultant pointed to a woman smoking habit ... and ... are better her diagnosis and another as a consultant said ... don't get cervical cancer\nA comment that if you weren't having sex you wouldn't catch the virus that causes cervical cancer I Do believe some of these cases we'll go to a medical council hearing I think that to some of the women will make a report and there will be ethical unprofessional tribunals into the forms of some doctors\nNot just recently another of the women who was awarded a large settlement has just died and so\nYes so in June ... county carry with five children settled her case against another lab quest diagnostics in America for seven point five million euro Emma died over a week ago and she was an amazing campaigner for truth in this affair and she fought very hard for her children\nProtect them and ensure their future there was a huge outpouring of sadness in the country this week during her funeral here she was speaking on our to your radio after she learned her cancer had spread\nTo have that kind of guy ... ...\n... and I don't think it might show up and I actually read\nAnd what does the government said they'll do about it\nWell the government was forced to order a review and an appointed the British public health expert Dr Gabriel scali and his report was published quite recently and he found the cervical check system was doomed to fail he found serious gaps in the expertise and governance of us he did find no evidence of conspiracy corruption or a cover up but\nHe was highly critical of the attitudes and lack of openness by some doctors and not tanning ... of the results or the way they were told and he called has called for a mandatory open disclosure into health system here so legislation needs to come into play structure or something like this\nDoesn't happen again under discussion as we speak at those a compensation tribunal being set up to avoid women like Nicki feed them and the late ... we're going to having to go to court\nFor difficulty hearings to get compensation\n[noise] so do all the women who were affected by these Smith tests that were incorrect labor pool shed now ... ... lecture will be out of this\nThere's going to be other as a doctor scali appeared before a parliamentary health committee last week to discuss his findings and he said the basis by which to ... executive has calculated this group of two hundred and fifty when women that that was slow so he did say on those are the more women will be found to be affected\nThe results were view we're going to be a review about one thousand eight hundred and fifty slides by a team from the royal College of obstetricians and gynecologists in Britain\nSo that should tell us more some women understandably don't wish to get involved in it or for legal reasons won't give consent for their sights be examined the will be more women the exact numbers we don't know yes\nI was talking to federal balance now against the world life expectancy lead tables out with predictions for how long people living in different countries might live on average in the future and Japan which had the highest life expectancy and twenty sixteen doesn't help the child so who does\nIt depends been leading the world for ages and this focus it goes up to twenty forty says life experts in Japan will be eight to five point seven years well it's been bitten by pointing born or if he is a little over a month by Spain at eight to four point eight years\nAnd this is in the future that is that this is now\nYeah this is the projection looking at current house friends whack countries all around the world are going to be\nBy twenty forty and bought\nThis team of scientists have done is they've looked at Seventy nine risk factors that affect your health so that's things like smoking rates obesity rates but also by the people have access to clean water and sanitation and some more unlikely things like income and education levels\nAnd pollution looking at those trends and then for casting into the future in about Twenty years time ... impact those changes and those trends are going to have a life expectancy\nSo all the countries all around the world so Spain's getting it right what are they doing\nWell it's this transition that we've talked about before and I think most people know is going on of how the things that kill us this stuff and being those big infectious disease and then more diseases of lifestyle things like heart disease some types of\nCancers as well and ... Spain is doing quite well that is those\nGood lifestyle behaviors so is the good old fashioned Mediterranean diet but also lower smoking raises one of the things that keeps them ahead of Japan which has a [noise] a slightly high smoking right particularly in men enough how Spain has managed to leave the table\nAnd his life expectancy still rising in most countries whether or not that high middle income countries\nWill globally they're expecting a full point for ... increase in life expectancy over the next decade and a bit however it is a mixed picture and you could get a lot of rich countries making a huge amounts of ...\nPlaces like Japan simple staying in Switzerland or all going to have life expectancies ... eight to five years on average according to this focus but you get other countries Central African republic Zimbabwe Somalia so so ... so what you're seeing is\nThe water is being progress being made a huge gap in between the poorest and the richest countries isn't closing\nAnd this report also has a warning that one is attempting to do is work how will the best case scenario and the worst case scenario is for life expectancy in the coming decades and it says that in his worst case scenario if things go\nQuite badly wrong them off of countries around the world could actually see the life expectancy folding so do you think that living\nIn the mid to late eighties the dumb Dale Cody\nOh thanks for that maybe I made to Spain now James let me ask you a question do you say me grain on migraine I say my ...

people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country [noise]\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years and you know other said they never thought they'd be something like this in the lifetime so when the door open to attend in the morning first customers walk in you know a big cheer corrupted\nAnd throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really

drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict

the west it's about different parts of the world and how we're working how we're shifting things from one place to another\nHow we're making wholes in other places and creating structures in other
