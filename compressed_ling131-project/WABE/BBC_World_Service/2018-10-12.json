[noise]\nNow what was being asked about how in American Ron charge you sit up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them wants to be abused instead\nThe more than me

of golf had come forward and edging they had been raped by the organizations made ... coordinate kept Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and let the died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate on ... funds just by this scandal ... people in Liberia\nOne man who took up the story now your long investigation is really young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro to pop up ProPublica on time or does it\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier\nWho was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground that selecting girls often then managing scholarship program\nLast time went on the organization was through the\nThe marketing of both you have to find their kicked him either\nWas able to win the million dollars in a competition through Facebook which then meant they could open up a bit on school but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements the police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten\nWhen the ... began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts talking\nYou know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nGirls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson how did the investigation and fooled will basically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was known in Liberia that there'd been accusations of grape but are really no one has ever gone deep and to\nReally find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened there was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls but we're in a year or so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation and minimize the role of demand\nBeing a central mind into organizations had an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had in power to him by giving him the power to educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and then when it came to light that\nHe had been reaping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures and challenging contacts may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl\nThey ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named that his victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you know if there'll be any changes at all to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped one of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two\nGirls were the first time according to their statements to the police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the ... came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time and\nThe organizations founder and the organization overall we're courted very strongly by international press subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six

including macular degeneration a leading cause of vision loss Jon Hamilton NPR News\nAccording to a new report from the national Transportation Safety board the natural gas explosions that rock three towns in Massachusetts last month were caused by our contractors failure to install a new pressure sensors that led to a flow of over pressurized gas that sparked explosions and fires that killed one person an injured Twenty one others\nThe NTSB report also says it took nearly three and a half hours between the initial over pressure alert and critical vows being adjusted\nBut in terms of the ordinary people and you if you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that call and trying to use public transport it's a tough off\nCertainly I think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of\nTop down leadership in terms of what\nLeaders that they see the level at the regional level and at the national level do and we also need lots of my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these cold benefits of\nChanging the way in which we work but I think that you're right that the notion that from one day to the other and we're going to get people in London to completely changed the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because she reads in ... public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as you are you in a and Julia mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that this is hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with these both top down and bought him a\nMulti ... says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to the Christmas\nBut I don't agree I mean I think I was getting people to get us a cone still sitting in a traffic jam is that she couldn't appealing a skinny if lots of people go to the cause and we're on the bus that wouldn't be the traffic jams so everybody get to it for a suit you know the private code is not the answer to freedom all happiness and if you sit on the bus then you've got lots of people to ...\nBut that's the reason that there are plenty of people who do see that individual is being in the Congress something they've ...\nI think a lot of people actually enjoy public drones but when it was well if we think about young people now look to the mic choosing not to drive particularly if they live in cities where the public transport goods so is it I think is the others have said it's more important that you have good public Jones ...\nSo you give people the real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoys the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and it's also the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they would we can change systems have more home working\nPeople working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis as well as an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nFootball this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example of think of an aviation people love flying the gig on holidays that traveling for all kinds of reasons how in us would something like aviation fish in to a much greener well\nWell the new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September I think lays out a way of a restructuring the global economy and the way that allows us great for freedom and greater opportunity for a a more sustainable growth model\nAnd we have at the moment about there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems so cold hard to abate sectors including things like shipping aviation\nSome forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on there\nAnd they were crossing our fingers innocent ...\nNone none of the people were working on this all across the world and moved development going on there's a report you out of the end of November Barbie energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development of ... technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect of short flights being possible using ... technology supports same wave law a long distance trucking juveniles\nEasy not as likely I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and every kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated\nSo I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNo everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it\nThat they're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but is it that you're talking about how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard and so it's important that people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and the likes of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term slides\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's birds lowering our missions and one in which people living standards are higher\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people are larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies that will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... cases if I can just bring you back from them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that go there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see action right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as ...\nI'm working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension for that has to be aligned with one point five Paris target for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's ... support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they imagine a world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how a manageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not you know\nIt's just want to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to for\nThis one really should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impact if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd with two degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar is far cheaper than relying on coal or gas or the other folks of\nJudy assigned lots of good news that say renewables are going up but all day reliable enough and is there a place that nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to touch we need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news however they've not been driving fossil fuels off the grid\nAnd in the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much but just this week the government has given the go ahead to drill for fracking depressed in the roadside which is very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government forced them to accept fracking on their location so very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just on developing renewables and driving their price down\nAnd incentivizing renewable production but we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development and the other two separate efforts why I don't think that we can count on cheap renewables\nIt's too much to ask of cheap renewables to drive also seals off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking the lord another at another level as or a deal on it and we were in\nLast week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all of this was off the back of the sales of oil and increasing the gas\nWell I think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and the ... report talked about energy talks about land use talks about CDs and talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables by themselves cannot do everything it's of course is here to make these investments if there's a lot of surplus however I must say that Norway is actually more some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to sink\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources I'm happy doing it [noise] um I think um\nWe need to you know you mentioned I'm retired at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that this one point five it's perfectly too old I Would like to kind of real\nInto the optimism that they're ...\nThey're trying not to miss them but I think is really important to note that he's extremely hard that we need all the options that we need action from all sectors we need to find those community we need a policy community at all levels a ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need to everything and I think that that\nIs an enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics in the moment but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between America and China I mean there were so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy reporter for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make a wartime unknown show when the twin daughters and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make all the time and that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrifying energy supply and make it a low coping as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still don't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's PCC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and our own humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that the soldiers could say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this little seriously\nFall no\nCan't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck\nWith us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've uses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that is true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city from companies All Facts were still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI unimportant Lee when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other forces such us shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which is the odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition\nGiving people other jobs is part of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because of the level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the u._s. hasn't gone with this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments that three\nThousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the ah swelled the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to join the ... the he's a professor of environment and develop and in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\n... on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nSo just reports is really off for by the governments and mobile feeding through political pro says at the end of year and over the coming years governments who have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table so\nI really do hope that governments take into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on a track towards reducing global emissions Laura\nIn tiny as time I think if we have countries that put in place you know the politically viable second best policies to create coalitions of winners that reduce the costs to search that invest in innovation at that emphasize cycle benefits maybe [laughter]\nWell Bush\nI don't mean we have any choice but to believe we can because the alternative is we just gave up among its old do so on one doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it\nMore people have to engage with politicians and say to them we want to choose the future we have because of the future not just for the people here and now it's a kind of well we want to leave to our children and grandchildren I think most people won't the will to be a better place for their children grandchildren than they currently have\nJoined the group the court

than girls often then managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements the police had been raped by the co founder\nHow old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began\nOn than girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names or given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge you talk\nTo you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh wants one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mountain darkness nationhood an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had in power to him and then eventually said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you know if there'll be any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were for the first time according to their statements to the\nPolice so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the ... brick Liberia at that

actually you know you're taught that it's a if you're visiting someone's house and uh you did not finish your food you're being rude so that was something that was\nSuper super hot for me to deal with because of the harsh criticism or teasing that I Would get it's\nBecause I haven't touched my food so I guess it's abnormal for a black person to not wants to eat it's not like food um it was a very strange thing for people to see\nWas any of this about your body weight with any of this about wanting to be saying\nThere was never a point where I wanted to be a you know skinny or an ideal body

how skinny I was or how unhealthy I was looking I didn't see my family for very long time you know there's just a grand sense of shame that comes with that as well\nYou know my mum would ask me what is wrong and I could never explain it as a result I just felt to keep to myself\nHow did you ever met anyone with an eating disorder\nNo never had you ever heard of a black South African with an

older white women\nThere's a lot of complexity to being black and of course a lot of complexity to being watched as well but the experiences because of the history of this country of segregation up about the age of separate developments\nIt means that the reality is a distinct difference so a problem that I might suppose to an older white women from another generation she is not open to all the possibilities will rather than reality of\nMine lived experience they will give me watch solutions for my block problems\nWhat which good treatment of looked like what did you need to do you think\nUm I definitely think if I had spoken to a black female therapist she would have been more helpful to my um situation could you found a black female therapist or I think they do exist yes but they um to combine [noise]\nI did find that kind of cool psychologist who specializes in eating disorders but like the feeling it might be hard to find many more [noise]\nDo you know if there are many black

disorders [noise]\nFull in LA westernized nation is a major factor in the rise of eating disorders amongst the population [noise]\nBut summed up to as a wariness putting too much emphasis on infants from the west when we talk about eating disorders in Africa [noise]\nI really feel that when you talk about ...

threats on Twitter that\nEl Mohammed bin Salman can get you wherever you are okay this is social media nobody knows where it's coming from but we do a take notice of that\nI just want to take a step backwards for a moment because it is important to remember that just Eighteen months ago the world was so excited about this man Mohammed bin ... thirty two years old in effect put in charge\nOf the the world's most oil rich king Dimock key strategic player in the middle east and he came to power pledging reforms saying he was going to be a dynamic reformer of the Saudi economy he was going to

United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nI at the Saudis can't or develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr could show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see a criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and

end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nOne is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers for ... that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening\nA Saturday influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed by the use of American weapons\nBy the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis\nAnd I don't know how long the

I've been I've done the whole as the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base and warm security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the oil installations\nLike if it hadn't been ten men it's secure and his position he wouldn't a leader result to these kind of erratic acts the war in Yemen it's been going on for a lot of flak for years and we have seen no end to the bombing using Weston a ministry equipment\nThat ended up with the story that we ran\nAnd it's an incredibly detailed story fourteen thousand would article was it difficult to take that deep I mean it has to get these huge get the documents you needed\n[noise] it was like having a million puzzle pieces thrown into the middle of the times square and being asked to put them back together we started out trying to figure out that really simple question and it led us to Fred Trump Donald Trump's father had died in Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd four or five years later the Trump children's sold Fred Trump's empire and it was a massive sale that went through very quietly to another real estate developer in New York\nAnd not let us to just think wow like Fred Trump had a lot more money than we'd been thinking through public documents we were able to piece together how Fred Trump\nStarting when Donald Trump was just three started establishing trust for his children so he made them his landlords he started putting land into trust that Donald Trump bone and then he would be paying Donald and his siblings rent and then we started making calls and we were just incredibly fortunate where we had sources who\nGave us access to ... and thousands of pages of confidential\nFinancial data including two hundred separate tax returns\nAnd the results you know for the rest is really forensic is there a reason why you went into that amount of detail [noise]\nWe felt given the allegation that we're accusing sitting president of tax fraud that we owe it to our readers to document that as well as we could\nGo out and she said that the accusation is so serious you have to be forensic and what you're saying\nYeah the New York times to accuse the sitting president of multiple locations for tax fraud is never happen and it's incredibly serious what all the legal consequences do you think now for the president\n[noise] I Know that the city in the state or looking at now various taxes that could be owed both on a city and state level [noise]\nSome of it for criminal liability has passed the statute of limitations but there could still be civil fines coming the Internal Revenue service could also open it you have to remember now that the person ultimately in charge of the IRS as Donald Trump\nThat I'm sure as a challenge there should be a right and wrong and all of this and if they did something wrong I Hope somebody is able to show it in a way that results in at least ... taxes being paid on the money that they do\nDo you think that Iraq school will change anyone's opinion about Trump intends of his support base [noise]\nI don't know I mean I [noise] I sort of try not to write into a political ends or think that way I think what it does is it sets the record straight the Donald Trump got a lot more from his father than you knew you said so many times you know what I'm self made billionaire and my father mainly gave me moral support\nThat line was repeated so often that it has just been repeated as fact but we were able to pin down that it was at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars that was transferred\nBut at the New York times you quote used to say that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to the New York times that that that sort of default response to the well they hate the president that they will run this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be ...\nWouldn't say that it's not political ... were writing into a political world but it's just not what we do Washington is going to say what they're going to say and and that's their job so I just sort of try to figure out on our and how we can best ...\nStories to publication that we're proud of them that are right now\nShe's on Craig narrowed the New York times for some the absence of a political fall out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to finance media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as a senior editor at the financial news service Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about financing markets for the Financial Times newspaper he\nWrote a swan song article for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media immune response to the New York times story ... is a sign of deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the media in the most important institutions that go up the economy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that plainly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was brought on us by the political and financial establishment and that the way in which was resolved\nWas unfair many people left behind in those responsible was punished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody is behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and uh on preparedness to believe actual\nEmpirical facts lots of that's possibly does come from the rise of social media but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe\nThe established meeting rogue nations that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more to be trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't he wasn't even brothers collapsed essentially that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the F T\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happen to have a lot of money just landed in ways to the bank account because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people in smart suits trying to a shovel their money around to protect it now that looked like a bank run technically wasn't they weren't actually taking their money out at the right but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we had tried publicizing this it would have been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this then we're going to get in trouble because this is gonna look irresponsible it's going to look for say where in fighting panic\n... basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there is a lot of confidence in that you've got to be really really sure of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nThat does make you didn't report it at the time\nI did not report that the time it didn't particularly the recipients me to say\nI'm ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about and I was ... by the sheer level of invective and the anger vis\nA rose the opinion against them as least false one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell

counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and the use of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hide them from the University of cans of brand new Zealand well through most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or court toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapt the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is underway and the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... ... loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together in these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where they're stroked that puts her side an application levels on their hands and they may touched them out\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWill first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of\nThe different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world but at least kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to sub lethal levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could reduce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemicals\n[noise] can you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the few yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful

states\nAnd North Korea or from ... ...\nThat's for the individual declaration I had ample discussions with President Trump as well as other U.S officials on this issue whose son if North Korea takes us and measures the end of or declaration it'd be a political statement would announce the longstanding hostile relations between John Young and Washington have ended\nSo we would need to have this declaration at the earliest possible date and I believe there was a shared understanding between Washington and so regarding the viewpoint so I Believe it's on the amount of time on a master of dates and we will be able to sign this\nWell Laura joins us now Laura this is the dream that Moon Jae in and the people around who have been holding for well decades or how realistic is what he's saying\nWell the thing when it comes to on pay per into four declaration I think that it's quite realistic he certainly seems to be an optimist and it appears that President Trump has disgusted with Kim Jong un at during the Singapore summit and but when it comes to what the us is prepared to give\nMuch of the Trump Administration is reticent when it comes to hunting of an engine for declaration\nVarious reasons for that that includes the fact that they have twenty eight thousand five hundred us troops based on their soil it may give North Korea I'm telling you the chance to turn around and go look\nWhy do you need these trips if there is no longer the war on this peninsula why do you need to have a presence in the south China Sea why do you need to have ... you know military exercises and these trips and not just base here for North Korea their base here strategically\nSo one of the reasons why the US's reticent about handing over this end of war declaration is for those entire reasons they are worried that it's too big a concession\nBut both can be as have said ... signed declaration that they will work towards this by the end of the year and it might well be that
