lawsuit brought on behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission athletes houses the policy known as affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in this\nMeans that they're not less in just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in but what kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have that chance is boosted by some direction racial balancing its cold\nThat we have from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly ...\nI kind of the nation and acting background and a student at Harvard\nChicken is university and that's actually how many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case has affirmative action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but that is how affirmative action is impacting different communities and the point of the feminist action has been case to court communities that has historically been underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's found Asian Americans right now as it looks like hardly\nAny elections policies are discriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace lower\nIt's hard to say what Microsoft ... like I said of how it affected me that I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian African population has been increasing in an ac rapidly but the amount of Asian acting admitted to Harvard has been saying around the phone and started putting us\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as that is just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of sense and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action is the point of affirmative action is not as she says to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pregnant the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity and increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's not been talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus I feel like they're necessarily represent because of the group\nUm or that they have to speak for every person from that background um this is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students are Chinese background however for African\nAmericans for Latino Americans for indigenous Americans is is not this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even with the ... election as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but as before you were at Harvard you you were at UCLA and one of the complications of this fact is is that in California\nAffirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume ... that's how you felt\nGolden age that's turned a true over the course of action\nAnd unfortunately this is this really didn't you know all of that happened to no avail I'm just wondering what kind of pressure or and appeal to the end

place there are there many states that are fragile where there are\nNo it was a massive pandemic disease and and then where there is no need for a massive humanitarian intervention\nCertainly aspects about exist but what does also changed is that there are you know some of the fastest growing economies of the world are applicable fastest growing economy in the world is Ethiopia a which is

don't seem to discriminate between their infants and other males and fence it's hard for me to believe that the mothers don't notice that you know they they pay attention to what's going on around them\nUm we don't know exactly why female should prefer this in a species aware it's not exactly clear what mail carrier is getting them\nBut what we're speculating right now is that perhaps this is basically a signal that males are giving to females that when they need arises for them to do something really important like protect\nAnd in fact that they're willing to do it and this is how they show females that one\nThing I'm I'm intrigued by is the the mothers will obviously be involved in specifically maternal I imagine ... kind of thing when we when we save the males have a strong paternal row house strongly about or they just like washing the dishes once a month connoisseur [laughter]\nSo what are the things is very striking when you study mountain gorillas anytime you are around males you are also around infants so from the time that infants are old enough to be moving around independently from their mothers\nMales adult males specifically are seem to be there are other preferred adult companion so males do a lot of um what we have colloquially call babysitting or\nThe literature but they also do a lot of behaviors like playing with them wrestling with them grooming them a rafting in contact which is basically the equivalent to sort of sitting on somebody's lap if you're a human\nAre sitting right next to someone on a couch I'm you know certainly the amount of care taking that they do is nothing compared to the females but again for a mammal it's incredibly unusual and it's really hard not to watch this behavior and to see something in it that looks a lot like what we see in humans or\nLast question when you will that watching in the wild\nObviously you're watching as a scientist but surely some of you is sort of tracking across some sinking in human terms what this would be looked like a ... this would look like I mean you mentioned sitting on the sofa does it sometimes look to you that they are sitting side by side on the sofa or sitting in dad's lap\nAbsolutely yes it is impossible you know yes of course you're you're a scientist and you're trying to be as objective about this as you can but you know you wouldn't be human if you didn't see some sort of parallel and it really does look like those sorts of you relationships that you see between many fathers and their children\nAnd that's why ... amazing not the best jobs in the in the world pretty good data that amazingly would be humans and you can almost a really humans are the best well anyway but the grill is a pretty extraordinary and those I should say all the

Lewis kept for the smallest foot and a half mode it's my for the law just ...\nThis will be awarded today for the narrowest ladies waist and the biggest knows\n[laughter] so it would seem to promote his victim now a century on from when ... ... there's not much has changed when it comes to trivia and celebrity ... and it seems like a perfect remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed fact and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real truth of those that can be invented\nAnd controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes to mind\nAnd one can only imagine well he just sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare to ensure there are many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um this image as as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing ... crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to an editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute or co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply a ride and the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces as what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that his language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden do publicity or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally background or wherever he's talking about all of them that and they have yeah and these articles awfully religions to classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you've said and he was a continued the ... tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of the truth or principle you've heard a few these already and Chris started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book full several times\nBut he himself was also a way of the limitations\nAnd aphorism never coincides with the troops it is either a half truth old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows tell me Katrina why was it so important to him\nWhen I think at a had a really ambivalent relationship today as yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance and\nThey'd give back to max Reinhardt who've navy famous said class this time in Germany especially um he developed a day on a mentor navy Shelly\n... productions and contrary to cross the kind of embrace that yet ... blender\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... just to stage for the spoken good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama\nUh itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crass than is before the first World War is someone who is surrounded by lots of companies fell off his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably the other choice some punt the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the month points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in completely or you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it simply because crosses born into a small bohemian town or because there was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe you'd better setters own\nMade and this cat and thinking about what are your feelings [noise]\n\nAnd that's from a radio version of the last days of mankind dramatized by Giles half ago\nUm cross began writing the play in about Nineteen fifty and it turned out to be a mammoth undertaking some seven hundred pages whereabouts ten evening's performance is\nReally it's possible to give a show somebody or something so long and complex but but I Would tell me get an idea of what what crosses trying to do here and how he's doing it\nIt's important that probably first emphasize that nearly half of this play\nConsists although I don't think it's ever been determined the exact amount but nearly half consists of actual quotations that cross lifted\nFrom either newspapers or from conversations that eventually overheard on the streets of Vienna or in the cafes where he spends his days and I say this because this fact has led to some commentators to call this play something of a documentary play which is not entirely an accurate description\nCross is definitely documenting the war in words we could say\nAnd in part because I'm Simone and Katrina have established the journalists who were supposed to be doing this or not for the most part is cross thought they were swept up in the nationalist fervor that cross identified as something of a of a kind of collective\nSalo Jean and so Kraus has um we could call them and alter ego in the play the grumble or\nWho maintains a running dialogue with his dialogue partner the optimist\nWho is presented as a much more naive figure than than a malicious figure 'em and and I say this because the optimist tends to be someone who kind of reproduces newspaper headlines and he takes their content at face value so he doesn't have really any critical dimension to his\nHis audience is and this is precisely crosses point that what was counting or what constituted is healthy commonsense over which of course the newspaper editors held dominion was the very problem\nAnd the play we could say puts on open display the actual motives of the war is cross saw them profit\nNationalistic muscle flexing techno mania we might call it an romantic ideology in this kind of mixture and cross would say you know the collusion between among these impulses is what led to and what perpetuated the war\nIf I could also maybe reduced the drama to another crucial inside and and as you said reducing this drama to any number of insights would be a kind of insult to the to the complexity and just to the massive undertaking that it was but it would be this that crosses\nAstonishment that an entire civilization appeared willing to destroy itself in part because of the new media technology so not only the press but in this case also film and photography which play roles in the in the play\nHave made it actually possible to become a spectator to one's own self destruction and cross actually write something of this sort in the sort of the forward to actually even prior to the place prologue cross I Would say prefer to be a witness not a spectator\nSo the the way you could say it's kind of put the side of the ... and they don't keep drum isn't it that that play 'em an eight seed took about ... mania and as with so many things that can cause that's due to technology was complex he likes the convenience of something like a ...\nBut he also dislike the noise and the ... they created\nContradictions or would seem to be right through his his life there again he also felt that far too often technology was not being employed well and as far back as Nineteen awaits he rose complicated enough to build machines and two primitive to make themselves\nBecause clearly just bad of the war and the ... of humanity that exposed as he observed the devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people mean\nOff the ... and ... of the wall came the dissolution of the Austria Hungarian and planned this happened a hundred years ago in October and November of Nineteen Eighteen telling me what was crowned says reaction I mean after all his native country what his great love seed money still resigned as\nIt became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to us and then Katrina said early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than\nProbably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy has actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic um I Would actually argue that cross as the war was dragging on especially did not only really anticipate the outcome as it was\nBut that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what he saw as wholly moral institution to ruin\nThat is the very institution that actually ... who's the war on subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what a scholar Edward Tim's is called a quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually ...\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so crosses\nAgain you know and it's kind of enlightened meant um attack trying to connect the dots I'm Better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess the type of thing they cross embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more tenuous as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye a very keen eye on the reactionary elements of society as they were developing even from early in the Nineteen twenties so specifically the clerical side of Austria\nBut also so called fringe parties on the right for example even the one that hit the represented and actually it's very interesting that I Believe as early as Nineteen\nTwenty three thought earlier cross was already paying attention to the swastika and already knew who Hitler was and so that's I mean as far as foresight goes or very few who had their finger on the pulse as it were\nAble to answer to his view on Hitler in a moment but in the new much smaller Austria that resulted from the ... of European Buddhism after the war\nCrimes continue to expose what he saw as greed craftsman is an end the stupidity of his fellow citizens but he did keep an eye on the developments elsewhere to Nineteen Twenty one\nHe published what was to become one of his most celebrated articles promotional trips to hell now this was prompted by an ... newspaper the trips to the battlefields of from a company to tell me why did he watch about this\nWell this ... promoted motoring tools as you said that um as one of the battlefield pie extending off that meant comes to build rides a company like coffee cake to places ... died\nThis kind of battlefield tourism or as you could call it kind of meat packing all ... of the press that old I Do support the war and also conveniently forgetting all kind of mystifying all the horror and atrocities the suffering that happened in that place\nAnd all that I'm kind of as a tourist package for money cause of video dislike tourism in itself but in this context it was especially horrifying for him in his text and by the way he mostly test sites the ads and uh it was also at text he'd like\nTo eat it all up well let's head across

homelessness\nOr this week I'm a it's a basically made sleeping on the streets of crime a police have more power to arrest them move rough speakers alone has been condemned with a legal challenge from the European Union\nI speak to somebody who works in housing I'm a housing advocacy network based in Budapest it's called\nThe city is ... everybody a ... beside each joins us now can we talk about statistics I mean the government say that there are eleven thousand places available for the homeless in state run shelters so how much bigger than that is the problem of homelessness and rush sleeping [noise] it's hard to say\nBecause there are no reliable data on a on streets homelessness or number of people who are sleeping rough but it can be said for sure that are around three thousand before sleep sleep rough on the left actually been into\nThis winter days and the number of cross sleeping people might be as high as a a six thousand or ... thousand I'm In the country\nOkay um why do you think well I mean that that would look like the shelters are available are you saying that the homeless on not looked often or don't have a viable places [noise] um\nWhat I think it is a it just by Toby is just a from their own numbers that are the shots are system is a incapable off providing accommodations for for everyone always homeless\nAnd I think that that's because people don't want to use them because the simply on the the spaces I'm Sorry I'm I'm just asking because I Know the quite often um the homeless people don't like ... goes with a shelter is that the situation in Hungary\nI'm ... now I was just talking about their own numbers so even if a fire um if we don't talk about ah the quality of the ... and we just look at how many beds are there now many people are sleeping out\nIt is quite abuse that currently the centers\nAre unable to accommodate everyone however I also think that the United nations society at the homeless people are are unwilling to ah to use the shatters than we should think about how the ... can be more can be made more decent more clean and more safe\nOr more dignified instead of a funny scene will mess before um who are who are sleeping\nRough now why do you think the government's taking this ... this movie it is as I understand that just\nSingle line in in a statute that makes it illegal to sleep on the streets um why politically is the government doing this do you think\n[noise] um I think it is a little bit of mystery and really um because they'll be ...\nUm industry is back then there are a significant ... the author of Hungarians thing that's homeless people should be held them support Dede than not funniest\nSo it is really not a society or which ones to criminalize homelessness if not even the police are I think the measure to deal with what he's also think that a woman ethnicities that social policies housing for the issue what is the issue and not the policing issue if he's really adjusted the governments\nAre against everyone who tends to work with homeless people\nNaturally or is he while your interest or was it was would collide in this I just wanted to ask something I mean you said it's against the European values a victim Ruben and his government have already said that made it quite clear that I don't care that much about that is it illegal though is the legal a sanctions that can be made all taken\n[noise] um I don't believe in in the I I don't think that the European Union would defend the Hungarian homeless before a for a long time it's like all be is that the EU is\nMuch more concerned about the ... the criteria that and the the defense or for the forest\n[noise] uh Hungarians or to ride the inventor the rights of a\nForest Hungarians because this is not the first time the government's doing their life's homelessness a beach has been before the seal the ball for men to scenes two thousand and they left and the difference is that now he's an even harsher legislation which which is a which enforces a universal van right on the street from us that's not to the beginning of this story right\n... thanks indeed violent or ... from the city is for everyone housing advocacy network in Budapest\n[noise]\nCouple of weeks ago a new state we reported sure about the resurgence memory language ... not only marry but also European New Zealand bears are using it even more\nSo naturally global corporations like Coca Cola are jumping on the bandwagon with some unintended consequences of bending machine and New Zealand main international airport was spotted sang Ki automate\nOn it ... is hello but the main part is the problem because of money it translates as get hung out that's\nNot a great slogan for a drink that is used by at Coca Cola so for more I spoke earlier to Henry and Mary studies lecture at Clemson University of technology\nFace reaction walls and then I was at the same debt and as you were they when your language as they used to taking you know at ...\nProduct but then I thought about it and also you know wash imitation is a former Slattery and the fact that a large multinational corporations are thinking about my language to use it is actually not a bad thing or bad that I don't actually drink Coca Cola\nGeorgia in television yeah surely you allegations relate to an evening you spent with Mr Yamaguchi and twenty Fifteen and you both have different versions of what happened that night that you initially mess up in a bar to discussing internship\nYou were drinking and then you recall feeling dizzy and tossing out and then by the end of the night to taking you back to his hotel room where you claim he raped you argue incapacitated\nWhereas Mr Yamaguchi position is that he took you back to the hotel because you were drunk to travel and learn and he says you will come late to ... and you had consensual sex [noise] what was the response when you first took you out of ... to the local police station\nWell first of all it took me a great amount of courage to even go to police because he was such an high profile journalist and had a strong connection\nWas Japanese bleach go world and when I went to a place police initially said well these things happens a lot and\nWe can't investigate and this is about men and women issue I was quite surprised that they didn't even start or even filed a case\nSo she or he was this the first police officer that you spoke to\nIt was my first time to go to police and the port I was asking for a female police officer and they asked me why in the waiting room so I have to tell in front of everyone might have happened\nSo I have a starting to talk with this female police woman and\nAnd then of conversation she told me well I'm Sorry but I'm from traffic department and icon report your case so can you talk was a male\nPlace and so I did but then he told me well you have to go to the different PlayStation because the instant in what had happened was in a different area so I have to talk to three police men to start with [noise]\nIt was very painful experience to tell the same story over and over and I remember when I first went to a place that was just crying and I couldn't even talk\nMuch us I start realizing that I have to repeatedly tell my story I have to find\nTheir way to be able to tell this painful experience over and over and the way I guess I discovered to be able to\nTell is to think I'm reporting about one case and this had happened to this girl so I Try to think as a third party ... percent and I think that is how I mentally Monday she did\nKnow sure he's poses investigation you say you ought to act out what happened to you tell us about that\nYes so during the investigation they asked me to Leon knocked and\nThey took me to one of the room and there were three male policemen around me and they asked me to lay down on the floor and\nThey start placing a life sized all me and stopped taking photo and asking me was it like this was it like that [noise] it was someone I have to turn off my mine tried to not think about anything but I was quite traumatic experience\nPlus a cue to drop your case on the grounds of insufficient evidence and July twenty sixteen even may twenty Seventeen that's ten months later you actually decided to go to public office to reveal your name and your face to the Japanese press y\nTo be honest what had happened to me was shocking but even what was more shocking was when I have to go through that afterwards going through this in the ... the un knocked meant and\nI start questioning about how little support we have here in Japan for a sex crime victims so in our apartment it was about time for them to talk about\nReformation of our rape low and I felt strongly that I Need to talk about what we need to change and also I discovered how difficult in how to boot to talk about right itself in Japanese media and it\nWas hard to talk about my own story but um that was the only way I have left\nOh sure like to comes to ... to ... Japanese society in a moment but I should say that ... she denies within occasions and you filed a civil case against him and museum and Gucci is defending the civil case [noise]\nThat's the case is very different what made you decide to find a new lawsuit against you form of both in twenty sixteen\nShowing two thousand six fingers said today I was ... from very high profile producer in Georgia so he was making sexual advances towards you yeah favors yeah sexual favors\nCould you explain to us what was the working environment at the TV station ... was it like for you know working within that environment\nSo Georgia societies like struggling with all the gender inequality and sexual misconduct and famous died at ... that's when women and girls are killed by men yeah so sexism in every environment is not a big deal\nSo she's tough person she's like ferry sexiest he was always like commenting ... sexual comments\nFor me before realizing that this was very unfair\nEnvironment for quite normal I was just like ignoring ... comments and trying to do my job because you know we all need our job and we don't want to have a job because is about economic struggle rehab in Georgia\nSo what made you then still more in these comments and then decided to actually make a recording of him because this is because\nHe was asking for thanked him I said towards nuts comments anymore she was asking for sexual favors from me regarding guy was striking to lost my job\nSo they saw the last moment I realized I was in trouble they saw such kind of formulation and they're supposed to return so unfair so tight just cruise notes being a silence and doing nothing so of course I denied it and I went to\nThe court civil rights cards\nSo he said if you didn't give him the sexual favors he free to do with the north of your job yeah and as I understand that the new news against sexual harassment in Georgia so how did you go about bringing this case decode\nYeah there is no particular like isolation against sexual misconduct ... job but we have this on to discriminate law where we have this part of sexual misconduct toward women\nSo we ... we was ice case also my case was before me to campaign and that's for me to campaign he was kind of why I think and car is very sensitive institution\nSo I could manage to was the case\nBut don't you considering that they were new precedents to this particular case took me about how you decided to take the case to quote ... what were you thinking\nI was like thinking I Would lose my case you decided that you as was fighting for regardless yeah I was motivated to fight regardless everything\nNow when he just said that shows are a mixed family disputes the outcome of the case and he's appealing to a decision on the grounds that the recording touching made breaches his privacy and his F. one new full income be used as evidence against them and there's no final decision on the case as yet [noise]\nJust a reminder you listened to the conversation and today we were to women who've spoken out about alleged sexual abuse in Georgia and then Japan both of them now campaign on behalf of women's rights [noise]\nI went to the moon brewed the about sexual violence in Japan and in Georgia how big is stigma is it to be a victim of sexual violence in Japan and she already\nThere is very strong stigma against rape victim here in Japan and even talking about sex is quite to boo but the thing is if you go out to sit in Tokyo\nIf you go to convenience store let's say you see these magazines ways woman bikini or naked women and I feel like there are many symbols and pictures and\nWhat you will see a woman being sexually objected but yet talking about sex isn't\nVery open and hearing Japan\nAnd in a traditional media like newspaper especially it wasn't come on to talk about or said the word or put the word of right\nIn the newspaper so they often use the word such as violated or if the victim is under aged than they will say they were tricked\nWell I'd like to even talk about where you Korea's on now can I lost touch you decide that you know longer working as a during this was not a choice or was that something that happened because you couldn't find work anymore because you've spoken\nI actually could niche I was like oh totally discriminated on many dropping service and I can like feel he's paying to everywhere the silver rubbish Finney that you're talking about yeah I'm Talking about him he's a very influential men with contacts in government\nBut could you be sure that it was as a result of he influencing your ability to get a job or was it maybe not just because he can get the job\nI can say for sure and they seemed but they say it's my opinion about that\nAnd surely where are you now in your career so you've written a book and you're working outside of Japan for me need to national media what are you hoping to do\nWhat I'm working on right now is to tell the story of what it's like to be a victim of rape [noise]\nSo I Wish to tell the story so they can understand and I especially here in Japan there is just a little understanding of what it's what can happen\nMentally psychologically if there is enough understanding for that part I don't think police would ask survivor too we and knocked\nTouchy a new and now we can you can paint and you're doing all these different things but do you feel that that incident that period of your life is now behind you\nActually I don't I'm Still fighting games the cards but I'm trying to stay positive\nIf it's possible and I'm trying to tie DEA law ... we can send these so helps me also in a way to feel safe cause I feel I'm\nDoing something guy mean action so I can say that tech shows their stories behind me the show is like very ... very ...\nBy ... to ... cents from them and I'm trying to develop personnel into something not telling me for my carrier but also for other women in Georgia you have to tell you how to carries they\nSaid to mess with you yeah but you do actually\nSpeaking out for both of you had considerable consequences too strict law the backlash would you do it or they can test you\nOf course of course I Will do it again and again every time I don't feel like it's my ... pickup I think that it was a very brave to do\nYes me too I have no regrets\nSure untouched yeah thank you both

I feel completely hopeless like there was nothing I could do\nWell that's what some say anyway others disagree the fact is it hasn't fully inverted yet unlike old economic indicators it may not be totally infallible right now it seems downright implausible to some people the United states is enjoying record low unemployment high record high growth rates for the last decade so\nWorried should we be is rough smuggled in economic acts but\nIt does give out false signals no rule is completely infallible if he was making money from financial markets will be easy and it isn't that easy but I think the ... suggesting that the fed will continue to raise rates now\nBut that in the in in the traditional way it will overdo it it will do too much too late\nThat the U.S economy will begin to slow down and the and the future it would have to re cans instant cult interest rates and that's really what he's saying and I think if you do believe in the signal coming from from the yield curve right now what you're really thinking is it the U.S economy although he's doing Britain they now\nThey see it as good as he gets under the Trump tax cuts cannot the wrong time of the cycle putting juicy into the system when he wasn't needed with the result that an a world that's called ... that now than ever is going to feel some some pain in the future and if you believe the the deal 'cause that's what you're frightened off\nRight so basically the U.S consumer will field start to feel overloaded as those interest rates rise and the fed will lead you know just this after it's too late\nYeah not just the U.S consumer the consumer as an issue but I think it's actually corporations they've taken a lot more that since two thousand seven lots of it to fund that was a ... a lot of it to fund share buybacks and dividends which you could use a little bit of financial engineering so I think if you are going to see a squeeze on actually think it might be that says this time around\n[noise] so the United states remains the weak point potentially in terms of the global economy\nI think at the moment it's the strongest point I mean we've just had some numbers on what you're in the U.S economy has grown over four percent year along the lines basis but I think you can argue that he's the weakest link because everybody's so convinced he's going to stay that way and I think when you look at\nThat being so much higher than the walls inflation is just starting to creep up a little bit from strictly investment points of view you've always got to be ... you almost none of us when people are out there most confident\nIt does seem counterintuitive though in a way of saying that the economy is doing best in the world of that will develop Richard ... is the one that's the most vulnerable point\nI think he's ... he's probably because it's the world's biggest economies the world's biggest stock market is the world's biggest marketing tell them the world's reserve currency\nAnd an if the U.S Federal Reserve does continue to raise interest rates out ... I I Know it's it's not a consensus view I think that would would give a potentially a boost to the U.S dollar and these things as a do go wrong and the rest of the world people both flooding the dollar says so that the the Dole are going up will be will be a key feature\nThat in itself will make us exports less competitive and it will drain liquidity from the rest of the world so I'm not too worried about the U.S economy but looking at it through the U.S through financial markets want it means for stocks when he means occurrences if a dollar goes up that's generally sign that people are
