don't like this would very much because of the way it was a ... it's really been turned upside down\nHold on wait a second here let me see if I get this right now in a video and it describes men spreading as quote an act of gender aggression and outright disrespect to women yep that's right but she refuses to be described as a feminist\nRun again two for two and interestingly enough that social line often echoed by Russian state media decides that feminism is an evil western ideology focused on hating men an ideology that he's not compatible with Russian values culture\nOkay so where does that leave us\nWell we had the allegations that have been made about the video that it was stage that was part of a broader propaganda plan by the Kremlin and by the way we did put these points to the Russian embassy here in London they said they don't understand what exactly the video is quote unquote\nPropaganda being okay interesting words but we also had how the people involved in making and spreading the speed you respond to those allegations again they say it's all nonsense and fake news so to get to the bottom of the story I think we need to dig a beep\nBeep a journey will take us to Indiana to meet a Russian troll hunter and we also find out why those Russian trolls developed an interest for stone walls okay say the force to be with us [noise]\nBetter than after one two Oh yes a lot that a lot of that that's just Russell you had that testing the microphone\nFunny thing about him kind of leaves a double life by day he's a systems analyst by nights he becomes a Russian troll ... to\nKnow yeah I Do it totally for fun I live in Indiana it's cold here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually do and uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's just the thing he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly stirring arguments on line\nAnd his journey began a few years ago in the run up to the last us presidential election\nI felt like I had gotten a lot of misinformation and disinformation online over the course of maybe\nTwo or three years leading up to the twenty sixteen election and I decided to go out and figure out where I got this information from\nI didn't exactly believe that Russia was messing around on social media when all of the major news reports came out but one came out that listed the name of an account and what that accounts social media name was\nThen the man that I could actually go out and look up information on that account and that got me really interested in\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing a Josh has a background in programming and I see\nHe understands social media and he knows the mind of a troll because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nInto hashtags on Twitter and are sending out tweets that trick people into thinking on someone else so\nWhen there was a a thanks Michelle Obama supposedly high schoolers were sending out of this tweet with pictures of their\nDisgusting looking conscious I just randomly looked up bar fun to play and tweeted

the tweets of obviously not a high schooler\nBallroom or\nHaving followed dozens of Russian from all accounts having studied that behaves yet ... isn't a great position to tell us wanting to mission wolf that looks like in real life and he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of dispense spreading video\nThis really really fits\nIt'd almost perfect example of the pattern\nThat you see these Russian trolls or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again\nThey're going to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior account\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentions et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nThat would count myself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balanced\nWhen ... the less jet I came out last year some sounds to key issue with the casting choices\nYou seat never before I had to stall will still have so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening at the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was\nMolten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThat were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know\nFor years and the Russian trolls I've been sort of themselves and American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about ... isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer a tactic that's the kind of idea just to generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society to take the style was example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who agree and something could disagree\nBut if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nI took a look at the numbers the two thousand and Seventeen and us provided more than thirty five billion dollars in aid\nGemini per second with twenty five million dollars and the u._k. was said was Eighteen billion dollars\nOr not might not come as a big surprise given those countries have some of the world's largest economies\nAgreed and there aren't any real surprises when you look at the country to the boss Mitt the less Eva Iceland's living yeah instead of I Can't make up the Boston St intensive tied to the mountains given by the CD members and none of them the change in the ... largest economies\nNow I'll listen to Libya Austin is what the foreign aid per capita was a better way to measure how John ... is a country is\nRight this is why you divide the total amount of aid to countries gifts by its population and when I did that picture changed completely the United states gets roughly a hundred and eight dollars per person which places them seventeenth on the list of the twenty nine countries have accurate tasteful\nThe Scandinavian countries do particularly well new way leads the way with seven hundred and eighty dollars per person and Sweden Denmark upset and focus on the list contributing ... five hundred and fifty dollars and four hundred dollars for that took me\nA while the Scandinavian countries contributing so much\nWell let me take you back to Nineteen Seventy when the United nations tickets suggestion from a commission they look to the future development assistance it proposed that countries get no point seven percent of that gross national income to official development assistance by Nineteen eighty ... and they test\nIn two thousand Seventeen only five of the twenty nine obesity countries met that no prints them sent target they were Sweden looks in the newly them\nAnd the United kingdom and the average across oh let me see countries with no point three accent and the United states is ranked twenty second giving no point one eight percent of gross national income\nNow if the United states wanted to get points and sent it would need to find ... hunter tape billion dollars on top of that fifty five billion times it already kids\nThanks ... so that's the day so when we look at twenty nine countries the report aid spending to the CD but what about the ones that don't some more secretive than others one in particular has brought pox against\nChina is a particularly opaque donor and lender it has opted out of international recording systems such as the CDs creditor reporting system and the international aid transparency initiative in fact Beijing considers the details of its overseas development program to be a state secret\nThat didn't put pride and his team also\nWe've developed an open source method of data collection that provides very detailed financial operational on location all information about Chinese government financed\nProjects all around the globe coming from four different places from English Chinese and local language news reports from documents that Chinese ministries embassies\nAnd economic and commercial ... offices put it in the public domain from the aid in debt information management systems of China's counterpart countries so think of the finance and planning ministries that are on the receiving end these incoming money\nAnd then finally there's a large body of she's studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we've developed this very in depth methodology to synthesize all this information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government financed projects and a hundred and thirty eight countries around the world\nSo to the numbers show in terms of China is spending it tastes off the old world's second largest economy\nOne of the major findings that emerges as the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government does not qualify as foreign aid and the strict sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding does not qualify as oh da and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data two thousand two thousand fourteen\nChina spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison to us provided at least twenty five billion dollars of OJ each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a foreign aid the U. S. outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the o da is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for the U.S to be outspending China on OD a by five hundred percent suggest a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China and the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen\nThe U.S government's spent roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time so if you broaden the aperture and use that broader definition of aid\nChina's spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion dollars a year\nChina gets lots of aid money to Africa and spends particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications\nBecause most of these projects that commercial they don't count tools or da\n... competition number it's around fold almost proposed OJ Seventeen dollars per person when all of the money stocked and remember that the equivalent us number is a hundred and eight dollars per person brought pops pointed out to me that bull though China is a global economic superpower\nStill has a huge number of people living in poverty\nSo politically giving overseas aid is difficult on mice explains why the Chinese government is so uptight about what to\nFend costs are reporting [noise]\nAnd now ... asks why are women increasingly turning to wellness [noise]\nTo the movies this\n\nIt's a friday evening and I'm On the top deck of a full ... the ... into a restaurant [noise] off a busy road and the sound of sirens going off and the people who during chips down ...\nBought in ...

no no no no it's still very early but um I have to say that we went the first people to come up with the idea of making bricks using\nYour ... that's actually what we take from the urine is we off to the area so there's a a company in the U.S called by a Mason and they use\nA ... that they are but they use them tick tick urea and\nYou know anything about what comes from it's really not a sustainable prices so essentially what they do they take the nitrogen from the edge they use a lot of energy and then they converted into your ear\nAnd when we started this project we we well I knew that for example year and has a lot of area that's the predominant component in it so I wanted to know whether we could be exactly the same thing but is that you're in the states are offering them much more sustainable prices\nAnd the short answer is yes we can some now we have to see how we take this for\nSo many questions on this my attitude is just said that does it does stink Dillon\nI guess it does [laughter] but the way as well or the process but the brick is well\nNo it's a ... so let me just clarify so the new show prices so what it does is as a byproduct purchases ammonia\nAnd it's the ... that you're going to smell us or if you've ever had the opportunity I guess it's safe for example you had to pick like maybe a cat and the peed in a corner and you have that strong smell them or any of being released\nAnd so those prices produces ... as a byproduct but what we want to do is we want to come on foot that I'm writing it into another fertilizer because essentially at some nitrogen rich source of of potential for drivers so that's the third part of the price of federal was talking about so\nThat's the next day and age to see if we can convince fact into another fertilizer any health risks in this done\nSo I get the health risks so we have to apply for complete ethics approval as you can imagine the university so that was granted\nSo they use it themselves starting to ever come in contact with the urine it's it's just like you wouldn't use a normal year and all the health effects so if if people are concerned with the pathogens and harmful bacteria\nThe prices for using stage one actually kills all harmful pathogens impact here because we operate at a strain the hockey H we operate at about twelve and a half\nSo that ph has been trying to kill pretty much everything\nAnd then what we do we take that liquid component we dropped the ph slightly and then we allow the bacteria that we want to her in the mold and then that's what we use for the

which we care about and\nWe have a lot of there's an Arab ... alert system is that bring our research is and um you know members of stuff together you know to to try to see on this big economic and

acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence so we'll basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells round them so it's almost like self thing I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... does well\nWow so it's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around as ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a self becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nAnd get effected me quite a lot you know at the end of the day we wanted to be able to support those positive reforms\nA buddy became clear that showing up at the future investment initiative or would not be taken as a pro reform message but would really send the message that what was done to gym all was acceptable and that's just not a message that I'm willing to send\nSo you'll sending a message to the Saudis are you're sending a message to the people in the states to invest in you know\nI think it's a it's all all around I think that there's an ethical awakening happening in business in general driven largely by millennials\nAre who believe that businesses justifying questionable behavior in pursuit of profits is simply not acceptable in Silicon valley more and more entrepreneurs are starting to ask venture capitalists are where does your money come from who are your funders\nAre and we think this newborn awareness is incredibly healthy for the Silicon Valley ecosystem and his incredibly good for the world and it's a trend that we hope continues and we believe that you know while most diplomacy is best left to diplomats that business leaders can have a role to play and so we hope that this help send the message that Saudi should move in the right direction\nThat will be those who say it's ironic all of this because I haven't been some and already had a\n... a ... an unsavory reputation in terms of the war in Yemen for example the bombardment of that region some of his saber rattling towards some of his Gulf neighbors are and indeed the oppression of journalists especially some women activists in Saudi Arabia itself\n[noise] absolutely I and you know we have not like a lot of what we've seen but it's my belief that you can't judge someone just based on where they are you have to judge them based on where they're going\nAnd and considering the culture and values of Saudi and where that countries Ben I think a lot of the reforms that ... had been selmont hasn't limit that have been very positive and so in terms of the art of its progress up until recently we've we've like where it's been going\nSo what are you going to do now [noise]\nWell now I'm going to hope that they re commit to division twenty thirty towards modernization towards the liberalization\nAnd if we see real positive signs that they are doing that and that they're taking seriously human rights that they're taking seriously sustainability that they're taking seriously the rights of journalists than women of animal will potentially re engage but until then we're going to be standing on the sidelines\nRight I mean what would that take ... what it literally take a major gesture such as the release of the human rights campaign ISIL something specific that\nThose would be good first steps I mean I think we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality on the ground in Saudi Arabia would have a long way to go in terms of liberal realizing the cultural norms we have a long way to go in terms of moving the country away from fossil fuels and of course there are a lot of people who are wrongfully imprisoned right now and I think all of those things put together would would paint a very good picture\nIn recent weeks on this program we've been talking about the full thing of businesses to take a stand on gun control for example the position of Nike that it took on the black lives matter movement and the cold and kept in a campaign\nIt seems as though more and more companies are being forced to take a stand on political issues whether they buy apps didn't in the past\nI think this is fantastic since the Nineteen seventies business has been dominated by this idea called the Friedman doctrine put forward by Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman and the essential idea of it is that the purpose of business at me sole purpose of business should be maximizing shareholder value and nothing else and what we're seeing is that in that\nWay of thinking about business had has led to a huge number of problems when businesses chase\nProper at the expense of the welfare of their employees at the expense of the society around them at the expense of environment they spent the human rights bad things happen and so we think that there's a real generational shift underfoot that's very good for the world\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists sets ban and so what do we know about the embryonic Saturday reform process he refers to do that well not all that much in concrete terms we have had some relatively symbolic changes already best known among them legalizing Saturday women's rights to drive in June this year\nWhat else do we have critics points to ongoing reports of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi led coalition bombarding and block hating rebel who the areas in neighboring Yemen actions that are thought to cost tens of thousands of civilian casualties\nOn the economic side the crown prince has proposed the building of new eco friendly mega cities in the desert aiming to diversify their country away from its oil focus\nHe's created a huge so Britain will

itself\nThere's definitely interested in making\nInvestments and companies in Asia and in Russia and in Europe and now Africa is also being talked about the focus is on making investments that then team at a localized in Saudi Arabia and that sort of remains to be seen whether\nThose investments very well be localized and whether it will contribute to the Saudi economy and just have employment in any real or effective way\nIn which case how seriously can we take this reform protests in terms of the country's domestic arrangements have there been any clues at the conference itself this week\nThe app senses are without a doubt noticeable and prominent\nBut the question is really whether\nThat rovers health and fitness being withdrawn from the region and that's not something that we're seeing more stuff than lower level executives attending the conference I say you know they want to be in Saudi by the image is still important and that's why the executives are not\nExactly we Japan's softbank I think was one delegation where they went to Saudi Arabia they didn't go to the main conference so I've had from another Australian outfit that's done something similar\nAnd much more prominent if Russia and Asia and the majority of the featured deals with Asian companies they're mostly in the oil\nAnd gas and transportation factor for of technology conference in those areas involve a lot of technology but it's not the kind of technology focus companies that we saw featured prominently last year\nOne thing that's surprising to me is the reports that the conflict is still packed out I mean despite all the absentees and there are many of them that they still manage to kind of it's standing room only isn't it by the sounds of it\nIn certain sections that definitely been standing room only there's definitely a very heavy presence of Gulf area individuals\nSo essentially if the Americans uh oh Europeans were staying away it's pretty easy to find others to step into that that place\nIs definitely a recognition that there's a lot of money that the Saudi Government is still interested in putting into their not stopping this diversification plans are stuck on solid with it there's still a desire for foreign businesses to come in and participate in the following Saturday autonomy\nI Believe my I had been some and in his speech to the conference this week praise for example the head of the French oil groups hotel full being one of those who agreed still to attend despite the control to see that he suggested that loyalty by\nForeign trading partners like this would be rewarded there is a clear push back against the boycott from others\nThat's typical of what Saudi tradition this idea of ... at\nA but at the same time ... ventures in setting the have largely been with around ... an around police generally seen as a sure bet tall doesn't seem concerned about any negative PR from attending but their investment we've never really in question\nThere always we're always going to go forward with investing ramps how\nAre you anticipating a change of direction\nFrom Saudi Arabia how will this play out in terms of policy irrespective of the leaders\nIn general I think that they are committed to their economic\nDiversification print ad I think that would increase any other types of reforms ... Israeli on improving the economy improving and finance through major investments from the government at the very top down approach and I don't see them change and not anytime soon\nNonetheless do you think this week it's been a shock\nYeah I don't think anything will change but I Do think it has to shock\nEllen a walled president of trends bustle consulting here on business daily from the BBC well away from the questions of oil and diversification arms sales have been the big news focus this week specifically\nWhether foreign governments may decide to withdraw from existing contracts to sell weapons to what is the world's largest single moms by\nGermany has said is holding its sales to Saudi Arabia is such a the ... members to follow suit Britain France and Canada among the other substantial exporters have declined to comment so far\nSo the USA President Donald Trump has called the ... of the worst cover up in history but at the same time he's won the cutting any existing arms deals would hurt American Jobs and wealth\nThey order a military weapon everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it\nChina wanted it we want it as we got it and we're all of it every bit of it so would you cut that on why well what I don't want to do I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a lot of shit\nThey use a word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true\nSo what does the over all state of West and arms sales to Saudi Arabia to enter stuff you know this is a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sussex in southern England\n... ... ... when the wage\nAnd the good watch what you mean by an older guy that if we take the big businessmen who around the time\nWhen they said look for that call ... village let's take Mikhail ... was he and all that go\nHey let's take Mikhail Khodorkovsky when I was in business I wasn't in government and when I was in government back in Nineteen Ninety two I wasn't doing business and even all my assets which was by the way very modest at the time were controlled by people who weren't in government\nMost observers would disagree in Nineteen eighty nine identical ski used his contacts and the young communist league to open his first business by Nineteen Ninety two before he even ten ... he was a millionaire with his own private bank\nAlthough to him it might have seemed modest tacit he made his first millions when the bank acquired shares in state companies that were privatized for bargain prices but his ambitions when much of that as stated in his own manifesto glorifying money in title is\nMan with a robo [noise]\nOur goals are to the task sub defined we're ... to ... billion that the Communist Party took away a lot but it also gave us enough experienced connections life state just a compass his profits a hero is his financial majesty\nCut that of course he became a billionaire in Nineteen Ninety six optic he acquired Russia's largest oil company you cut through an insider trading scheme the so called loans for Chavez auction he was one of the few businessmen to benefit from this game in exchange for bankrolling president he has since election campaign\nYou have to ... to ... you and your calls with an easy do you do I cannot say that it was a pretty but it wasn't risk free either wasn't our idea but we went along with\nThe Nineteen Ninety six loans for shed scheme was late that exposes a scam along a handful of businessmen to rip off there are some people but it had been authorized by the government and again that's not what that of course he was charged with and two thousand and three no later into south and then nine\nHe was found guilty of tax evasion embezzlement fraud and money laundering\nBoth convictions in his view are upset\n... ... ... the ... stone in oil from myself how could that be how could the company be profitable even I'd stolen oil from as far as the first ...\nThe government said it hadn't been notified about child tax strategy will to joke of course we know to fight the many times we will open and our tax strategy was no secret\nHowever an upset the charges against ... his trial sent a powerful signal to the remaining or the ... not to interfere in Russian politics\nPresident ... official racing has been growing up I have a sense I mean how you could that'll go ski spent ten years behind bars and was find a new release in Twin Peaks that team he now lives in London Still\nHaven't reached man he spoke to me Dina and human foot weakness\nMembers supported Ninety point one W.

two point five million years what she was in South bend the\nHe spent as much as ... million euros and the ... the criminal aspect of this were to be substantiated is a claim that um there was a lot
