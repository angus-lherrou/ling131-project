their company in a way to the benefits of ah the owners which is a state with\nA dinner and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for how we can get off\nThat feels so I think there is a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience that oil that are the public sector for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north\nSixty percent totally in Norway said that we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north that are flippant areas and are they also have pulled showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons can convince them\nThat I think we're missing a a major part of the energy and world energy debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out in the world\nLooks at China for example and uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a grander scale and I mean that's\nSince Norwegian oil and gas is one of the most green once produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because specific\nPoint that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat that ... is very important environmental area in the nose have no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very special area on the whole Silicon Valley as far so do you think he had a tipping point as far as public\nOpinions consent no I mean it's the costs are eating out because we have a political platform other growing up where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country that because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd ah it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screened by three the new region hydro power than region hydropower is one tenth the energy of walked we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe I don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced\n... not to view this shed by much than region public that actually ... does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out the news from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing false ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy investing in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we're seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum as low as far as you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we attacked and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guess ...\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on cold\nIn the work but I don't know oh yeah we're talking about\nFirst of all my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving toward agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do all\nThat stuff is in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the old sinuses that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... of when I was next fenced in and out came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about with climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to\nGet our fault that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame\nBecause ... says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a natural Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it\nAnd remember that is based if we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables\nSix thousand percent another huge huge job ... on on how do you want to just to mention also that we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is hard to know where he smoked and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how ... states being built toughest new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell they thought is\nHow is anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at a moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe are in the ... and that is not all male study is for the world to reads the Paris Agreement goals with how to make major changes to the next four eight twelve years [noise] so we really how to de carbon us the U.S marshals society as we kind of soft us we can\nBut it's not really see that that isn't being challenged as it\nIt it's a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a strategy for a social change economic change is\nMultiple their moral question is really about the heart policy so how do we deal with climate change at the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\n[noise] that the environment and his to ally Elvis too and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to have to talk and had at the same time I don't think it's ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not try it on all them\nVarious I'm interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable is get together it stops and ... and the southwest it goes all the way to the northeast of England and it's going to allow new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this in a sense ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've level about his role as a fossil fuel ...\nMay be I think it's really good for us that they are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can actually ended up more renewables because they have this amazing\nCoastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much here as you can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted [noise]\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we had been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact though hydro power and we haven't seen that oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the use of energy and the way we develop energy and that actually if we want to be part of the European solution\nThan actually making more renewable energy it could be one of the answers to where we could put our money instead of\n... gay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas ... they're worried that the ... they're going to pay to go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to say for well\nOf course they are concerned about [noise] if it's going to cost more on if it's going to cost more to use your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline though has given us a lot of energy and different forums overload of years and that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way\nWe have a lot of discussions above wouldn't move parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there so it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern does huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're export power you don't use it for industrial production in no way that's the discussion above your work about where you live what would you go to do it's a problem there is\nI just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase for two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with local uh energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with that they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way it can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should ... sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is an example for creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we can do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy secure it is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen than it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... ...\nIt's meant to him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of them are in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed an you we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and say well known love this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the er and the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift to even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a a great expense Mandy a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have I think you've made it out there I\nKnow but it's it it sounds like it doesn't say sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and it's happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speed of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it close higher polls and absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that when you have and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by\nProducing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe\nIs Jolie grateful to buy ... twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an old uh gas\nOn board that terminal comes from the barn she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much U.S Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by ghosts in Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the current price has been originally seems to summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe gas will exclude cold wave to cover what you mean by that call them price the\nThere is a crisis could be the ...\nYeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our way of it\nSort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera that they haven't really ... the effects of climate change so more often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually plan for it\nBut we can't really hope for a climate crisis for Norway to to react\nGay uh snow to climate crisis but an economic crisis might change the timescale within which Norway considers its dependency on on oil and gas you know is how\nHow we ... we have to remember the last eight years we we reached peak oil in two thousand miles away\nSo we're ... production of oil from the last eight years so we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and with the predictions I see I Can't see that the one that is shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me David line that change look for new ways rolled in that particular debate but\nAlso started up where you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can't use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nKerry is right you've you've lost sister base well\nWell we all lost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle climate change and we're looking at three to four degrees and yes it it it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift\nThe economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here and that's why I've come back to this is a political question because the petroleum is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is none of hope for ah for the oil industry in terms of the economics as the guy at I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables well how did they get real can she wants to come in\nYou know I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the world will requests more energy so\nThat we have to look on the question as well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good here yeah I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and in the long term as well and it will be necessary to meet the green shift\nNo loss of agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas thank you to Kent goodness men carry this this cast ski a beverage Christ office and Gary Saudi Assaf\nThat's it

disorders at Columbia University in New York\nShe told me that same China up until the Nineteen nineties only a handful of cases of anorexia and believe me I had been recorded recent studies suggest as being a dramatic increase since then there are no official statistics\nIn multiple different locations in China the rates of eating disorders and the presentation of\nAnorexia nervosa blaming heroes of binge eating disorder are all more or less on par with what we see in North America and Europe at this point\nKathleen tells me China's rapid economic growth has driven the change as countries undergo social and economic transition she says conditions become right the eating disorders to develop\nOne of the things that happens is that populations on average increase in weight and in many cases that's a good thing but it is a problem for a subset of individuals within the society who then are at greater risk for eating disorders\nAre you saying that needs to be an abundance of food in society before someone has an eating disorder\n[noise] that's certainly the case for the eating disorders that are characterized by binge eating so believe me nervosa and binge eating disorder they tend to correlate with\nRising population weight and you can only have rising population weight when you have an abundance of food so it's not totally the case for anorexia nervosa that\nTends to have a pretty steady prevalence rate regardless of\nPopulation wait the cause of eating disorders is multi factorial right so in the context of economic development people also become much more sedentary people are eating more and burning fewer calories and so our weight goes up\nThe problem is that in a global world the global beauty ideals are largely\nThin ideals and that's not such a surprise because beauty ideals are typically the state of being that is difficult to achieve and so in our world now where there's an over abundance of food\nAnd it is difficult to avoid gaining weight then the beauty ideal of the thin woman becomes all the more paramount is it too simplistic than to say this as a result of West and I say yes as well\nSee the rise of eating disorders and other parts of the world the patterns are on the one hand similar but in each case there are unique aspects to the presentation and the understanding of eating disorders in\nCultural context for caffeine then to really understand the rise of eating disorders in China we need to explore the cultural context let's start by asking someone he's had an eating disorder when they felt that was anything about Chinese culture that make them particularly vulnerable\nOkay so high everyone um my name is Seth I Am currently Twenty one years old I Am is\nWhen staff was that team she went on what she described to me as a bit to the health kick which spiraled into anorexia\nAnd eating disorders characterized by an normally live both the white which typically results from a pass in reducing the amount they eat and increasing the amount of exercise\nI think it was the first of January very dramatic reach I'm On my mom brought me to um my GP it was just like a regular check up but when I got there they couldn't find my pulse and they they said I was like you know\nOn the verge of deaths that I didn't even know it all you know the thing is he just glides is the ... that must be awful [laughter]\nIt was pretty [laughter] I Know it was it just kind of um\n[noise] it's kind of like a past um section of my life\nYou know here it's the talk that despite them off to step takes over this very seriously she's wild west she could have died adults I wanted to put her in hospital where she would have been cheap fat but not given psychological support instead her mom agreed to help them recover it's time\nThat was five years ago and stuff now a psychology student in the U. S. writing a thesis on the intersection between culture and eating disorders she's from Hong Kong but says the cultural factors she's identified apply to much of China\nIn Chinese culture you might be expected to eat everything that is put in front of you but let's say the media to I was being approached by at the time was saying like\nOh being sin is better all these kinds of different like moral connotations that are attached to weight loss and wait in general and so it would be like oh am I supposed to respect my culture\nAnd you know eat everything that's put in front of me or do I want to be quote unquote successful in terms of what the media is prescribing it as do I want to be the best and of course in my competitive mindset of the ... of course I Want to be the best um and so there's this weird conflict going on and\nDo you think there's anything about women's role in society that comes into play here\nYeah for sure [noise] women are expected to be like\nSmaller and not only in the way that they behave but also like physically small even though I can say that in Hong Kong it's already more progressive than like maybe other Chinese communities in the sense that women are allowed to teach her ... her husband [laughter] if you are\nSlightly larger in behavior or in size just like you know you are a slightly more muscular woman even if you will be like stared at and I'm even myself as a woman who like lift weights I Do get a lot of weird stairs and I have\nHad like doctors tell me things like oh if you have too many muscles no one's going to want to marry you and he was a doctor it's so normalized on that you know people who are on like the ... or even expressing disordered symptoms\nNo one really diagnosis that it's only when when girls are dying oftentimes when when people are dying that's when they're diagnosed with eating disorders\nStaff told me it wasn't until she moved to the U. S. the university and she had people talk about eating disorders as a mental rather than physical illness\nPeople will say oh I had a headache instead of like\nI'm I'm not feeling you know emotionally well today and that's what I Would I ... I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh just it's just because like my head hurts or my stomach hurts because these are the things that most people express their discomfort in like that's the language that we use staff\nMade that even the what used to describe eating disorders themselves didn't feel right\nChinese translation of anorexia is actually taking food disorder\nI think it's just very misleading the way that\nUm it's named in my particular case um I I Love food with like my whole entire heart like food is life and so my eating disorder um developed it largely because I thought that if I could control myself in front of the thing that I I really loved and\nUm I used to eat with like no ... and then I could control my entire life\nStaff feels very strongly that sets in aspects of Chinese couch I make young people to take to leave honorable and eating disorders\nI wanted whether a psychiatrist would agree with her analysis\nDoped ... works at Peking University hospital in Beijing which has the only ties to wall specializing in eating disorders in the hall of China she told me she's worried the cases are on the rise across the country in the\nMail that mail you look in the food you there isn't reliable dates are available for reference all I can say is a clinical level we do feel a particularly huge pressure as there are more and more people like this\nMy experience tells me it's impact is huge it has destroyed too many families ... that you call\n... ... when the we used to think that eating soldiers were middle class problem all only found in people who are relatively rich but now it seems the problem is also seen in rural and walk and talk to people\nI also see an increasing number of boys who are ill they say that they want to look like the ... often um South Korean style to a very slim and somewhat feminine looking\nIs that enough awareness of walked eating disorders are in China do patients and their families and friends recognize that they have a problematic enough to people realize what these illnesses are\n... they say the ... the issue\nHow should I put it the awareness level is not very consistent that is some patients' families might realized very early on but they're not as it might take more than ten years to realize there is a problem and the food they realize that they could have been treating it as a ... logical organic logical disease\nThe feeling of shame is very strong so many people are not willing to face it I'm currently there's not enough attention to it in schools who pretend to see when a person becomes ... and\nHow much do you think that western ... contributes to the problem of eating disorders in China\nBecause I'm Chinese Chinese people are very conservative in this respect we wouldn't tell strangers about our illnesses also when I got checked into other sufferers who had sought medical help I called the feeling that don't just don't see this as impulse and and I'm a nurse so I Know the adults\nThey they don't get eating disorders you just need to learn how to control yourself over a period of time slowly it will get back to\nI feel in China most people around me just don't understand the important a neutral country have friends who are below need you off but [noise]\nBy ... and staff told me they didn't think doctors could help them\nSomebody else don't need to psychiatrist how common this attitude as she told me a desire to be in control is what drives many eating disorders and that can be why suffer as a reluctant to hunt as a responsibility to doctors\nShe says the real problem when it comes to treatment is that this fall to lift all available\nAccording to the world Health Organization in twenty four team for every one hundred thousand people China had less than two psychiatrists\nThe figure in the U. S. is twelve it's not clear how many of China's psychiatrists specialize in eating disorders but since we've had doped elite what's on the knee closed was offering treatment in the whole country\nOh was it was just the ... and this is not simply a question of mistrust in dumpsters treatment for eating disorders spills very underdeveloped in China it is very difficult for a patient to get a correct diagnosis old proper treatment it's only possible in Beijing and Shanghai\nLeaders of mental health hospitals need to ... and pay attention\nIf the patient is in a local hospital they will not receive any kind of standardized treatment on basically be put with other mental health patients that died in baby will be managed but that said that probably wouldn't be any psychological intervention and that is just a reality and\nIn\nThe rise of eating disorders in China\nAnd the lack of understanding and treatment available isn't unique to the country who they some of the cultural attitudes and behaviors the fuel it might today it seems wealth eating disorders rice with economic development it can take some time for a corresponding awareness to develop\nAnd intimate does people are left to depend on themselves and suffer in silence and\nToo often eating disorders are still seen as a rich white west and women's problem [noise] we're going to talk more about\nThis next week when we'll look at the experiences of black women suffering from eating disorders in South Africa Nigeria and the U.S\nFrom out let us know what you think about what you've had on social media and using the hash tag BBC the chain or I'm On Twitter at anytime is BBC for me and the rest of the team ... ... ...

Olympic athletes such according to a detailed indictment from the U.S Justice Department\nAnd the Dutch government yesterday reveal details of a failed attempt by Russian agents to undermine the OPEC W the chemical weapons agency based in the hey why that was investigating the use of nova joke in the English city of soldiers pre\nSo with that in mind what kind of relationship between the U.S between the west and the Russians what kind of a relationship\nIs that now is a new Cold War I've been speaking to an apple bottom who is a historian and commentator and the British member of parliament bumped CD he was a journalist in the Soviet Union when it existed I began by asking and does she react well badly to the phrase new Cold War\nI she dislike the phrase because that leads people to roll their eyes and say oh no not that again we've that's over I Do think it's correct to say that we are living in a time when we are facing once again an ideological challenge to the idea of the west and the challenge is coming in part from Russia which\nCertainly sees itself\nAs at war with us in the very broad sense Russian public is fed with the daily diet of\nAnger and hatred about the west in western institutions the Russian government invests in anti western anti EU anti NATO political parties all over Europe they see themselves as in an ideological struggle so in that sense I think the phrase is although unfortunate is correct\nAbove CD you were in the Soviet Union now you are a part of Britain's political C ... is Cold War and accurate for ...\nIt it is because it's clearly not anything like the Russians touch 'em it says in eastern Germany much weaker but it is in the dictionary definition of total means which is a core values and interests and information\nAnd they may not have troops in eastern Germany but they have lost number of troops just over the border from a studio for example I'm they carry out loud scale maneuvers along the border of the European Union and NATO could tone hot\nObviously I don't know the answer to that it's certainly true that Russia is using its military exercises almost as a weapon in the information war So Russia has carried out very very aggressive\nExercises up to and including practicing the use of nuclear weapons\nThe point of doing that is to intimidate countries on its borders just show this kind of aggression therefore to weaken support for NATO and some of those countries\nI think what Russia would really like to do is when the war when the ideological ... without fighting but I don't think we can exclude the possibility Sunday they will use weapons and the Russian Army famous for that it does what an exercise as\nBob Said he will not in that ideological contest that marked the fifties sixties and seventies between the Soviet Union and the west what could be done what should governments like the u._k. government will the u._s. do in order to calm things down\nI think we're starting to close although this is Richard ... communism versus liberal society it\nIs a former Russian ... some of the great threat to mankind structured so she is\nJust how we are the worst offenders research from those very sophisticated all ... states developing means a state control which is not conventional shoulder and people but also to aggressively sauce with China\nOr Russia or whether it's the positive future\nYes up about maybe I was wrong maybe it is I'd be a logical all of those people who want to be presidents for life in order to Iran regimes versus those who don't\nWhat you mean by you logical but I mean I think certainly we are in a war of values are more is the wrong expression there is a struggle for values which values are going to dominate Europe over the next uh in the coming decades there are now parties\nPart of the ruling coalition in Italy as there are for example in Austria who also have very close links to Russia and who admire an advocate the Russian model of of politics corrupt crony capitalism authoritarian rule one man rule one party rule there is certainly a struggle of ideas\nAnd Bob CD can then the west can NATO can Britain afford this contest because it seems that robust armament might be the way to resist\nIs one way I don't necessarily the structure is much richer\nDistricts Democrats ... we can housing for registrations this country that if you represent\nShould always crazy or any sort of terrorists you know you have to be up to it so this is sort of difficult [noise] we can give you a list on\nTV stations deliver the extra security

states\nObscene a member of the British Parliament and the conservatives the ruling party an apple bomb the historian we can talk to ... in Moscow now I'll ask you about these allegations and reaction in a moment Sarah but since we're talking about the Cold War what does that phrase over and so the media in Russia\nIt does yeah it's a sort of bonded around in the same way here as it is I guess in a in Western Europe and and ... um but uh I mean I I guess I'd say that that's being twenty five years of open society here and however much sometimes it seems that we're going back to the past not\nSay on a human level things have changed so much hair that it's hard to think of us going backwards again I mean you know we took it off about the penetration of state media here and how that influences people's opinions and it certainly does but\nI look at what's happening recently with all the uh digging investigation that's being done by Jen let's say in Moscow Russian gymnast primarily a digging up on the Internet information about people who was supposed to be secret agents you know things have changed people's minds that does change\nThere are tempted to reverse the the clocks and and to go back to the thinking of old but in practical terms I think that's a very different difficult close to that back\nWhat then has been the reaction to these very detailed allegations from the Dutch government about this attempt to penetrate the chemical weapons agency the obesity W\nWell that is an old school reaction not set fuel dismissal and denial from Russia I mean the the uh the entire Raj accusations that's been coming from the west I think is\nSlightly uh surprised most go up but it's replied in it in its usual way in a way that we've seen ever since I guess getting back to climate anticipation of climate then ... and then I might Seventeen and they stay there ... all the rest of it is all about saying\nThat we didn't do it it's an accusing the west in this case the spy mania the foreign ministry put out a statement last night saying you know it looks like every Russian he has a mobile phone can now be accused\nOf being spies dissecting the evidence that saying there is no evidence but you know we're going to have it in ... standing up on sales independently as many other people here are so it's a funny uncomfortable moments unsafe in Moscow but at the moment that shocking until it off as usual\nBut those investigative journalist so you mentioned than they've been very brave or do they have the opportunity to continue asking those questions about for example the ... who they are doing to fight audio has been one of those who was the ...\nBut we do and we have and that's what we do so yes are there are opportunities and every time there's an opportunity that someone had to take it and it's Russians innocent as the foreign press and I'm not so job I guess yeah so that people on line in particular this new generation of online investigate the investigative reporters who were going through databases who uh finding information and then there's people like us who had out to the\nNine time zones or whatever it was far east of Russia\nI'm trying to find people on the ground and when we do that we do find them we find the evidence say for example the allegation that or at least one of the men accused of the ... the poisoning is a

impossible to hide it seems in a in the modern world in modern society and that was their gender still allowed to work and then I guess that is I'll jump to try and pick up the the details and you have to\nShare it really takes so much indeed that Sarah rain stood in Moscow you're listening to weld updates from London [noise]\n\nThat's good enough to wait for you know on the situation in the
