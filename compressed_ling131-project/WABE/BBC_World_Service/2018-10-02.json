switch off and disengage yeah it is actually I think we're already on them to think a lot of people need to see another\nThing is happening in the news and you just don't even think about it is just another bad thing\nIt's that feeling of numbness that his key to compassion fatigue Dr Lucy Maddox at the clinical psychologist in the u._k. she's been studying this for years\nI think it's helpful to

thinking and behaving that way using that is in the short time protective\nBut in the numbers have not very helpful\nWhen doctors or nurses developed compassion fatigue it can have some pretty serious

point where I just couldn't even brush that case it's almost like you saw it coming together when you do ... together\n\nFor some nurses aid workers are even moms compassion fatigue can be an occupational hazard\nBut with so much going on in the word the truth is we can all be susceptible to compassion to take of one kind or another [noise] tied to charities cope with it very existence depends and all of us carrying\nCharities really need to think about the type of message that they put out Dr Jennifer Hudson is professor of political behavior at University College London in the United kingdom she's been studying not only has charred his fight against compassion to take but how they could also be contributing to [noise]\nIn the development sector there has been a great deal of criticism of the sector extremely but within the sector itself\nOf this kind of traditional pitiful image a usually a single African child that took streamline malnourished and near death in many instances and this image has been used to generate that emotional response and individuals to get them to look at that child and sympathize empathize pity the child\nCharity campaigns can be upsetting but that's the point they work because they're upset we feed gilded into action but Dr Hudson wanted to find out if there was some kind of collateral damage if using these images actually made compassion fatigue worse\nSo they decided to put it to the test they showed two groups to separate poverty come pains the first was the one we're used to the poor single African child looking helpless

three years to make the appointments all face fines\nOf up to three hundred thousand dollars we'll just go in and from Loyola Law school in Los Angeles is against the measure and joins us now by Jessica\nHi thanks for having me what's wrong with the little promoting gender equality given that women ... under represented at the top of California's companies\nOh clearly underrepresented ... grossly underrepresented and not only grossly underrepresented but we know it's incredibly important to have\nWomen on not just publicly traded boards but on private boards we know is incredibly important to have women in politics in the law and we're nowhere near that I just don't like the fact\nThat this is a government mandated quota and I actually think that it's likely or has some serious legal issues and may not withstand constitutional scrutiny\nRight so you think businesses then might if they push for it to be able to get this little ... and\nI think absolutely businesses are ready to file in court if not tomorrow the next day and the problem for ... and the American court system is of course we have something called equal protection under the law\nAnd this law specifically on its face creates a preference for women and I'm not sure\nAnd the California will be able to defend that in the legislative history when\nOur law makers were debating this there was an analysis that said there could be some serious legal challenges here and you can't just point to statistics and say there's gross under representation of women because that is true you need more than that to withstand constitutional scrutiny\nBut if companies themselves on a lot of companies on putting women on boards and the government you'll saying shouldn't be able to to mandate to then some companies would get away with never having a woman up until\nI unfortunately I think that that is largely true but the government can do something without mandating ... so the government can say will create incentives will give you tax\nBreak if you want to have more gender diversity the government can do a number of different things to exercise his authority without mandating a quota the other thing is I think that it's not necessarily going to get us to the policy outcome we want to if you take the legal issues and put them to the side\nI think it's going to be very difficult for that token woman to walk into the boardroom knowing that she's only they're not because the corporation believes in gender diversity but because the law requires search you and\nI think that can be difficult for both men and women in the room and it doesn't necessarily lead to better policy outcomes we want\nLike you just got just ... to law school in Los Angeles\nRussian I think so no disagreement but there's a problem is just out in the middle of the problem\nIndeed and there's an awful lot of research which suggests that the more diverse company bought is the best of the company

um because it's got too soon that particular boarding system because it would it it it would have depended on boys would another system possibly have worked better\n[noise] uh I'm not sure I'm not certain of of a type of uh early warning system for enough to nominate but the important takeaway message that um that we can learn from this horrible disaster with all the\nPreventable preventable deaths is that people when they live an earthquake country and they live close close to the shoreline or they're visiting the beach they need to recognize that they have the power the knowledge\nTo understand that if the ground shakes or twenty seconds or more that is they're warning\nAnd that they need to get to high ground\nThat is very important so you're saying we effect to be relying too much on the authorities to make an alarm that they may or may not then lift the scientists to interpret it it's actually it's the education that you would have hoped after the disaster of two thousand to fool that message would've sung Kim\nAbsolutely and that is why this ah this disaster is really sad\nBecause ah people didn't learn that message so hopefully we can all learn from this message\nUm that if you're an earthquake country in the ground is shaking and you're close to the coastline that you need to get high ground and stay there in\nIn two thousand four of the people that live in the

Latina artists and then the feminist art is with Hayden ever as book clearly two thousand and two summer high ex film further popularized fried Apollo\nBut I think that for me what's really interesting is that\nBeyond the sensationalism of her biography her paintings and her art the deeper people look they see that she was clearly of her time influenced by the Mexican revolution by by communism et cetera but she was also ahead of her time\nSo it wasn't just feminist it was also people with disabilities people of color people who were marginalized her work deals with issues that are very relevant today like identity the female body\nA gender cross dressing or issues of what it means to seal fractured\nSide not be able to be a mother or not want to be a mother she gives visual

herself as the men I mean that shows her gender ... that he's so contemporary and we talk so much about today or\nThe intersection she represents a Mexican woman as an artist female dark skin Mexican and disable is all these values are so relevant today\nAnd she's always interrogation norms and assumptions isn't she around I'm thinking of her painting a few small nips when she's talking about how

head chopped off and she writes the top I Love you for your ... you know you don't have any children love you read the mole which she tried to send this picture\nWell she comes from Mexico a very macho society uh she comes from a place where women did not have the votes until after free to ... think about it she was very political but she couldn't even vote in Mexico during her lifetime\nOr in this specific painting she shows herself removing vestiges of her femininity or braids her\nAnd she's putting on something that looks like an oversized men sued taking on the power and the authority that males have\nThe lyrics that she writes on top were friends how women's identities and sexuality is tied in with their hair and how there is no unconditional love of women only if they act in a certain way so I think into a few small nips she\nUncovers the violence against women and here she tries to free herself of this role of a woman who is subordinate to a man and shows herself as a kind of and dry in this creature\nSo see all this attention to detail and it's very self conscious use of her body and the ... question and such but at the same time she's in some law school she's referred

age of ten I knew what injection means and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd there's like no I Want to be story and I love history I used to listen old grandmothers who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you didn't have a choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but one civil war had been and as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided to where I have to be you know this is where my energy is more important than anywhere else so my delivery and my first child that made\nMe to accept my mother's plan you when you live with your first child Fifteen Fifteen I have\nNo idea in mid seem background anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was doing this surgery and I'm running to them and to change the she is about to deliver and they see we in the middle of surgery just to\nGo look on there and I'm standing next to this woman freaking out the screaming and she's holding my hand and tell us that like just told the child makes should they try to do some fall so and he's today twenty four years old men and you just get married and then I'm so proud of him and is that is I\nActually do incredible [laughter]\nAnd did did you come across any of these IDs and your medical training will sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because he will change in Russia is that correct\nDefinitely for us as my mother's work and my work it's just putting the woman's house first\nIt's not the scientific level is just to give them access and being first and instead of coal country nation taking care of only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so that's where we were thinking about it I'm every woman has to have access to health care and it's a basic healthcare clean delivery\nAnd knowing a about Dr Jackson's work it just makes more fascinating yes that's ... that's what the research should be\nPointed when you were a practicing cardiologist\nHow do you think your agenda incensed you approach to work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you for sure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center\nOf women's health it's the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live\nAs well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure and I think being a woman\nYou've lived that life and you think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught but I Do think you're starting in a different place\nAnd you have had stopped decode when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were a woman\nIt's a huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you and discuss into sexual issues there Ninety eight percent of some other woman went to the F G I'm female genital mutilation so their challenges they're difficult to stay facing you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in as physicians in Somalia it's woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait her husband brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask what was your breakfast I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten you\nBecause she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids and she had been even eat and you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to diagnosing them\nI think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we approached a patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extremely they know in the condition and somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call every one who ... who died\nOf blood and and draw divide so we struggled after you know six seven hours looking at blood and treasure shooting card and she's good to go out a number of ... you cannot have the children you have to wait you have to do this given all this\nPatient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet\nAnd I was so if you guys you know starting breaching hairy you know you want to die you want to do this\nAnd by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just got my second husband if I don't give him a child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from is not only being a physician who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill and Web approach\nI went to come back to some of the other\nHe says and challenges you faced take all the first one to ask you about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases definitely and this is a cause for alarm because most treatments were designed for men not women went inside well science\nHas really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women so much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of\nThe science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\n[noise] and can you give us an example of the disease that affects the chief ... different she\nSure let me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference so if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something that's actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but\nWe still have a very long way to go\nNow Dick are you working in ... a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority [noise] one of the great just Barry is to say just treatment for the woman and you can do everything you can imagine is there because when you're done ...\nMy community undermines you as a woman but being a woman leader I have more windows to have a conversation with men because I'm not fair to them so I could see didn't know community leaders elderly were loads and go in front of them have the conversation much easier than if I was\nI used the disadvantage that country things as a woman leader as advantage and that's how we save our community me and my mother was doing for ... work\nAnd its owner is very crucial to be a woman leader and woman you on the table so that's that's the only way we can progress and bring peace in may come to the\nPoint where does it mean to you to be a female community to\nIt's a great honor to be able to use your voice to improve the lives of others and to have influence on\nVarious aspects whether it be policy whether it be here at Wellesley whether it be and how we carry out medicine both in the United states and beyond before I left academic medicine we\nHad produced a large policy report talking about the sex differences and pointed out where progress had not been made and that\nReport was taken and what it led to was a very large policy change just two years ago at the national institutes of health\nThat will now mandate the inclusion of women an adequate numbers in all phases of clinical trials but also mandate the inclusion of female cells and animals in pre clinical studies\nTo have that honor to work with my colleagues overtime to see that change happen it's what we live for\n... what do you think you take away from your conversation with pointless day\nIt's at the ... of honor and gratitude just to be new with her and listen and I wish I could just listen not talk [laughter]\nSo the and the policies you're making a difference is you know I'm I'm so fascinating reading all the research and that will consider\nThanking the medication I'm given to my women's Haitian you to females patient how they will affect the body so I learned that from you ... and I'm very honored and pulling thank\nYou [noise] deco ... I think the power of your dedication commitment you are enormous courage\nYour boldness how you conceive of women's health and how you make that actionable in the most difficult of settings is truly an inspiration so thank you\nWell thank you teach those poor black and decker thank you so much for having is\nMy guest today would do to decode Mohammed is a million ... he runs a hospital in school with a new refugee camp Somalia and ... to Paula Johnson who's been at the forefront of a mission to get doctors to considered gender differences in medical research and treatment\nI'm back again next week with a brand new episode in the meantime you check out the al ... any episodes on the conversation you might have missed or if you haven't already subscribed to put caused such will BBC the conversation wherever you get your ... thinks listening no you know\nOne of the next closer look to historic neighborhoods will discuss renaming Confederate avenue in Atlanta Grant Park neighborhood\nAnd then get an update on phase one of a four hundred million twenty seven ... mixed use development called Corey yards now that includes west side park and bill with Cory slated to be the city's largest park I'm Rose Scott closer look today at one or Ninety point one WABC\n[noise] oh\nOh\n\nComing out fits well tax on the b._b._c.

in the future to get repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to

have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nTo sneak\nOne thing I Want to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work in terms of costs were alone people going out

than it was anything to take it to patients cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good bad now and then put when it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that were in the ... about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that to repair it was a real Harry ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and say we're going to put them in the well

the seed\nUm than you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew it couldn't is going to be generally cheap nailed equipment and he doesn't get a job [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised I Wonder if in a pound of people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way that she's busy but just don't have the time\nYeah obviously a people loves pretty busy day to day life\nInitially there was some concern that the firm was alienating a core consumer group and you saw the stock took a hit the next day there are a lot of people that went on line very sort of vocal minority of consumers who burnt their Nikes and the marketplace was concerned that there were alienating\nA core consumer base what's happened since then now is that it's apparent this may have been actually a good thing the stock is more than recovered and touches all time highs in his online sales are proxy for broader sales it looks as if their sales have noticed played ticked up\nHow do you account for that given all of the negative publicity the public shoe budding and that we've been seeing the tweets from Donald Trump complaining about Nike what's going on\nWell to borrow from Nike's tagline Nike just did it or specifically Nike just did the math Nike sales are thirty five billion dollars twenty billion is registered outside of the U.S Fifteen billion domestically\nAmong that Fifteen billion two thirds are from consumers under the age of thirty five and if you're under the age of thirty five and\nCan afford a hundred and fifty dollar pair of Nike flying racers you likely a skew towards a higher earner and maybe dwell in a city which means most likely you\nLean left show by my calculations that probably wrist about one to three billion dollars of business domestically and that's at the high end\nWhereas abroad that twenty billion dollars there are very few people outside of the U.S would argue that the U.S is on the right track and is doing a good job of handling race relations so in exchange for potentially alienating one to three billion about thirty five billion dollar franchise they strengthen the relationship with thirty two to thirty four billion\nSo distinctive whether you think this was the right or the wrong thing to do it was absolutely the shareholder thing to do so in some Nike just did the math\nIt's interesting it's almost taking a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook you might argue to galvanize urine coal supports even if it risks alienating alienating some some on the outside\nThat's right great brands not only decide who they're for but who they are not for and they made a statement here\nIt came across as bald it came across as authentic and genuine\nAnd it was just a great trade to potentially upset one to three billion dollars of your consumer franchise strengthening thirty one or thirty three was a fantastic move Nike has them the move to embrace calling Capra neck will go down as one of the better marketing moves at the last decade\nDo you think that's more broadly true that in the age of social media and the age where people are much more used to kind of shouting out and perhaps opposing other people that they're being ... kind of more okay than it was\nWhat we're all hoping that sports would be kind of is a waste is from politics and it ends up that the last fire wall\nOf politics sports has been breached so there's no escaping\nIt now with Nike was able to do with dominate the headlines and buy some standards or by some estimates garnered somewhere between a quarter of a billion\nAnd three hundred and fifty million dollars in free advertising this to a certain extent is taking up a page out of the playbook of Donald Trump who constantly dominates the headlines with controversial statements and also big tax that is known for not advertising why\nBecause they don't need to show Nike has done a great job hair of grabbing the Mike back from other big tech and other consumer companies\nStill got away here on business daily from the BBC so is this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor getaway suggests\nSeeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than splashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program but we want to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. have also taken to activism as a personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take too much in the founder and chairman of the British pub
