this\nEconomics of the Iraq had absolutely nothing to say about how to handle the crisis it to go far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriately there was a school of economics that actually that is how to handle the crisis that was old fashioned games in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point but then people recommended fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using frontier economics or the guy that gets ... graduate schools they are using stuff that they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the surgeries\nThat rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy whose students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news as supposed banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed\nAnd what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others of building a new

deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's an tire early unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they said this is Tim\nAnd does she think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you were here is the more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd\nI've seen the first time how much economics has changed since two thousand image new perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes

literacy just like the statistics\nPolitics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn it means we can better understand the world around us and we would be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call them as citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate is going to provide a much broader basis of understanding so that when something new chance up like the threat of trade was\nThen the kind of a recession and the idea that somehow that they

that which I think is a great compliment the pieces of short and fast burning piece\nWhich is based on the sound of Kurt Cobain singing voice from the Nirvana unplugged in New York album that was recorded in Nineteen Ninety three he's singing the song where did you sleep last night\nWhich is a think a transcription of an American a song in the pines but his voice kind of cracks in that song in a very distinctive way and so Cassandra was interested in sound\nMm Mm no home ah\n[noise]\n\nThe same when you say that this was based around something that cut ... did with his voice to just not such a Muslim where anything comes from for you when you find do you need to know that or you just playing a beautiful composition by kasandra mellow\n[noise] well I think it helps to have a sound in mind so hearing the sound that Cassandra happens to be focused on when she was composing the peace and he'd be able to listen to that kind of as an artifact a sonic artifact\nThat's very inspiring

recommended me for a small project\nAnd that involved sort of an old ... treatment or story I didn't know what it meant at the time but I was very attracted to\nThe idea of manifesting characters

it'll be in trouble just a very phrase album called or experimental a scary\nHow would you open people's minds Michelin that is to what's going on in this world\nI really know the feeling because I grew up in a family that had nothing to do it obviously experimental music but I mean we we listen to classical music but it wasn't something that we listen to a lot at home it was mostly like\nIsraeli music and orthodox music and to this day one of my family comes to palm such within ten minutes they were ...\nAnd still they give me advice that I should write things that are more

a lot of spending promises\nTo get elected now they're in power and trying to honor those promises but to pay for all that they have to raise the amount of money the government borrowed and compared

debt already easy basically a break some rules does it\nYeah so he said no country should have debt that with more than sixty percent of its GDP or its annual national income unfortunately Italy has more than twice that amount of debt it has a debt to GDP ratio of a hundred and thirty percent or two point six trillion dollars\nNow the Italian government says it will increase gross that means uh
