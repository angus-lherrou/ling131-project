I was just that I'm speaking to burn friend in Germany a couple of days ago and she was working actually about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green policy of you know you're the Fisher the foreign minister from ten years ago the rubber sill to since ... this is the role of the more radical fundamentalist type of green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually often just with a different place the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know there are anti racist I mean and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean it was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday to uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people\nTurn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up so they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment you know pro sort of a you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they miss the humane policy and politics that used to be in that those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd well it's because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country is divided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in to people who are doing very well particularly\nPensioners this is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch and they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so to speak [noise] they're also worried about loss of\nAnd their their sense of ... see no their culture\nThey're afraid at part of the thing that the ... if they say they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries on to this is a a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh the flavor and the color on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with the topic of immigration but the last speaker was George ... the founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant what's your take on that I\nDid I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls and detentions to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more climbed a sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nWho you're simply what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in Clinton signed forms of migration\nI'm an income um and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to ... to be more danger um so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh about migrants coming\nFrom from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't I don't know why this happened\nBecause you you'll rice I've heard this perspective before why would someone with you to fill an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to that kind of I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a new notions across the globe have have done a ... I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the ... you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who looked like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way the world's\nRun um is it your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue\nIs immigration and China will the really big issue there is no immigration the sense of people from outside China come in but in terms of migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nUm is more important than changing sort of the high level policies because quite often there's lots of policies and regulations on the books about how to enforce anti corruption I'm I'm actions\nBut a those are ultimately an uninformed um and so if we can change the value systems across the globe about what it is that we actually valued devalue honesty to be value integrity between value\nUm you know people living lives that are that are accountable then perhaps we can enforce those policies much more meaningfully and so that's what the intention of the book is so it's great to see that you guys are now targeting I'm Eighteen to thirty five year olds which is an important demographic\nI'm In the scourge against corruption\n[noise] for instance is neither based on fat to expect young people to fly the flag around the corruption when the grown ups of set off a world where they either blend in will file\n[noise] yeah but you know corruption is a major threat to the people as well and their development in terms of access to education and employment for example and many other people are forced to pay bribes in order to get ahead so\nI think it's really all about a change in attitude that's why it's so important to educate young people for a very early stage so that they can learn that corruption does not have to be the norm\nThat can learn about their rights and see how much better society is without corruption\n'em and only then can be really build a movement of people who challenged corruption and even resisted and not become part of the system that grown ups have battled for them and it is\nTo feel powerless as an individual against the system and and that's why also with Richard against corruption of words we want and the winner is to have the chance to work directly with our local offices in their country to support them with implementing their idea\nWell kind of young people do though\nI mean you know young people maintain the status quo there will be no change and young people especially a more open to social change they use a lot of ways of communication to connect with each other\nAnd they're at tech savvy so there's a lot of potential and that and I think it's really about empowering them and giving them a role in the fight against corruption and it's really about you know trying and and of course there is an option but complacency and indifferent or not\nThat's bringing Casey Kelso Tracy you run Transparency International policy and advocacy to Australia whether corruption is on the rise what do you say\n[noise] Ah yes I think we see of starting by a decade or more ago that crushing globalized so instead of\nJust petty corruption and there's a grand corruption system or a criminal service industry that of all with\nAccountants and lawyers people who set up a show companies and these huge dirty clothes have gotten larger and larger which means that a lot of defines get larger and larger and there is no hobo policemen there's no\nThere's no natural enemy of these quick ... financial flows that go from London to Africa or back and forth worth or Singapore\nPanama there's a lot of money sloshing around up there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about ready big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah that um I Know well I'm a the author and I can talk about for the local level which is extremely important\nAt the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure there are banks or or a lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts of money billions of dollars that go into ...\nYou're taking a laundry or into a contract so one of the biggest of their schemes was in Latin America were billions of dollars were spent politicians\nRodeo you wanted to come in here\nYeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples up because I mean although Transparency International has a corruptions perception index with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at ... financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've got billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through\nYou know evading taxes through transfer pricing\nI'm mostly from polar foreign multinationals then you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices um and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence base has more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tens fancy international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa and then the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that sorry I did mean China yeah\nNo I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of the series of high profile arrest this time ... who was the head into pole and they seem to being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery an innocence what China's been doing particularly in the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national see position commission\nIs what you might call auntie transparency there's this huge crackdown it's very much to put up\nA little ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and just basically putting the frightened there's a large numbers of wealth people not just officials but movie cells even the famous Chinese movie star who was\nAnd hidden away for three months until she came out in the great ... tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply\nWay to go to Casey\nWell from my side I think in part atmosphere\nCasey this is about ...\nCan you hear me just try again yeah it's a a embassy international called or the national supervision finishing the systematic threat to human rights in China which we agree with that\nAnd people without trial without access to a lawyer for six months or having an organization that you can't a few ... Supreme Court is probably not the way to go ... I'm\nSorry I think the light as little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I was a question for all of you um and in fact Roberto\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer pricing or lift the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parents beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in the anti corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways of cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with a lot and so we have to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International but I thought of as\nA newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption on a major scale by a movie star in China just tell me about\nThat ... it's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about some being being the single most famous movie star will celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and she disappeared in July reappeared on E. three months later and very mysterious circumstances with the tax bill\nFor a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost as high as a BBC present the salary I agree yeah but I ... [laughter] well of course but it's basically a sign that China is willing in this case to basically make examples that incredibly famous incredibly well and then people\nTo give the idea that new but he remains on touch\nOf course many of these people one suspects of people who have fooled himself with the Chinese leadership said it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment that state Austin patients wealth showing no fuel wealth is no longer perhaps in fashion then that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nRope to last on this point if you have to sum up in ... seconds we do have a lot of young listeners on the b._b._c. World Service ... is a one point that if you're trying to say why not to be corrupt the young person what is the most important\nThing I think corruption I'm Still the way from basic social services so what could be used for health care what can be used for education again to educate the next leaders across the globe\nUm are use for their dubious means and so I think young people across the globe have\nA stake in ... in ensuring that their resources um are not squandered off by people who may be incredibly powerful who may be rich and wealthy already um so we all have a role to play and young people particularly can change the practice of corruption\nOut in the countryside in China when ... is it his grandparents and young children left in the villages well the study buddy men and women are going out to build a city is so that's another intergenerational problem that China's going to have to solve\nOkay wrote to run away will come back to show the but just listen to this town in Kent in southern England has become an unlikely destination for\nWhale watches graves in to seem visitors from all over the United kingdom keen to catch a glimpse of the Arctic Blue go from the banks of the river Thames but not everyone has been lucky enough to support the whale not even a reporter ...

'cause she'll get cases just so important because if this if this is uh if if the murder turns out to be correct which I which I think most people believe is is the case\nYou have a situation where um um if if if the Saudis are allowed to get away with this it would give the green light to every head of state\nUm that you can go out and you can kill you could even just a member of opposition journalists opposition politicians without any consequences this is a red line this is a global red line that that has been crossed and there has to be dramatic consequences otherwise similar types of things will happen round the\nWell the uh sector general the United nations I'm telling you know terrorists has talked about what he fears what he calls is the new normal the idea of what Bill is just said which is that basically government's going round kidnapping people hiding them away and in some cases killing that we had earlier on this story about you know Chinese tax\nVillages allegedly being uh taken up by the or the Chinese government to in the same sort of way and the sort of thing has to be stopped before essentially becomes another tool it international government\nBill just in Fifteen seconds mystical show gate was not a U.S citizen he was the U.S resident is that going to make a difference\nIt's not gonna make any difference at all Sergei Magnitsky was not a U.S citizen and they named a law after him to impose some that'd\nBe the sanctions and a half it freezes on corrupt Russian government officials and this makes no difference this is this is a point of of of high level of morality United States has already proven um in in the Magnitsky case that they can act on that and I will now as well bill Browder\nThank you for coming into the weekend studio\nVigils are taking place in churches across El Salvador ahead of the ... later today of the murdered archbishop Oscar Romero he was an outspoken advocates of peace who was shot in the head in Nineteen eighty while saying mass this is the reporter\nMay allow grow grow enough else who was an eyewitness\nI was sitting at the archbishop seat with my tape recorder that healthy now than it and then suddenly almost at the end of the time it was the sound like a huge explosion I saw in full [noise]\n\nDentals to those people were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him lying there bleeding do such confusion no one knew what to do\nIs killers have never been brought to justice protected by an amnesty law after the Nineteen Ninety to peace agreement I spoke to the American journalist gene Columbus in South Salvador\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... the jewel downtown where he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other\nIs little chapel on the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is he was he so important he was the arts\nBishop here in St Cloud or the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved\nAnd respected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after he gave a Sunday sermon directing\nThemselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and the moral order to go out and and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities who killed him\nWell it was for the most part people from you know on the government's thought the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out\nThat there was a growing leftist movement here to ensure the\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed if you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you could count\nOn him denouncing you forward in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers of never being brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that ends the law and\nActually this week in Rome the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks it's really important that there would be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them really to heal\nIs for the country to find out what the truth really was about his assassination and then for justice to be applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Columbus speaking to me from El Salvador [noise]\nI have a three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a planned statute of Manhattan a candy in Malawi commercial capital blanche off the ... muscle

we're\nTalking about is that you something that is going to stand in the ... or ... capital a hundred or so maybe I should a sign of tolerance if you want to have this statute build a sign up not

... shows that is somebody that I Do most of us ... it'd be\nSo if not Mahatma Gandhi who would you like to have a statue of\nWe listen to us from Nigeria Cameroon Uganda and Ireland asking crowd science about Jew Jew luck and fate and whether they can influence our lives\nSuperstitions like the ... have\nBeen found across humanity for thousands of years but of course we have a modern equivalents to\nIn many western coaches the number Thirteen is considered unlucky and so hotel frozen airplanes don't have ... seats with those numbers on although of course they still technically have the thirteenth floor or thirteenth rather seats\nBut in Italy the number Seventeen is unlucky while in Cantonese is the number fool which sounds like the wood for death\nAnd day today lots of us have little rituals to make us feel less anxious I liked Tim's that might bring us good luck all things we'd rather avoid doing just in case we tempt fate these kinds of superstitions beliefs and thought process is a part of something noticed magical thinking\nAnd that we'll find out in this program nearly all of us even the most rational and scientifically minded think magically from time to time\nLuckily for us all perhaps just coincidentally that's an exhibition on right now in the u._k. at UCSF fits ash Mongolian museum it's about magic ritual and witchcraft through the ages and it's called Spellbound\n... on the magical historians very cool joke tied to so few page has met us at the entrance which is fair to say is slightly unusual\nJust seem to be ... has a lot and so I get a ... by ...\nPoints out hey the walking on the latter is another thing that's supposed to bring bad luck in the u._k. and lots of other countries\nNext to the latter it's a question do you worry about

right now we can overcome right now [noise] your\nIdea of magical thinking this exhibition ... wouldn't leave me five magical thinking\n... to ... percent it's when you think oh Seattle police factual actions will have an impact on the physical world that they can't actually happen according to the little ... of cause and effect which sounds like a hippie ... hit with these questions and it came on fast yes to any of these questions and you're thinking much acting\nLike there's a I was just like I say with some beautiful you know just some questions do you have to tell a I've got like jewelry and things like that that people have given me but it it might in every day so\nI I [noise] and if you have something that was especially here and that was given to you by someone who has special ... and ...\nAble to replace it with an identical piece of ...\nNo ... no I don't know whether I Would extend not to then say that I was lucky\nBut it's a ... connection yeah it was an inanimate object ... [laughter] I find it very difficult to do that to a certain\nMagical thinking I guess it's something that is ... is a lot of thinking even though we might think\nOn on next question is do nothing rituals make you feel less anxious\nYeah we have permanent unpleasant ritual object is our example which has a taste with phones and really look much like a total knee move and I try to this is like and it has a stressful lots of rituals\nNice to be truthful magic rituals I think but not all of them have to protect some anxiety about home this is a question that I think will apply to look a lot of people and we could if we expand that we could include people wearing shoes when they're back on to a football field\nPsychosomatic if it makes you feel less anxious this may be a positive thing for you anyway I mean he might performed better on the football field or your family and you\nFeel like it's something that brings you could lock it just a question that gets me so what we have here is a ... as a man with pen in various ... at the multi\nThis faceless ... stick with collected in Malaysia in Eighteen Ninety six and looks every bit as disturbing as it sounds but brace yourself listener as things are about to get even dog\nThe making of a ticket and then facing with shock things very common and rituals to harm someone um this is I think my ... and the question is could you stop the image of a loved one\nRussian I Know we all know it's a black to divert attention on him and it actually doesn't bet any real relationship to the living breathing pass\nOne question I think where it's yeah it's really stumped me I mean I ... I came in thinking you know I'm a rational enough science degree I Know that there are these ... this is a real bearing on the real physical world but I actually find it hard to bring myself to either\nYou know we have to send me some facts has just today we did yeah so\nI think like me and the princes a couple of them out of your home and your brother is [noise] yeah I think\nAbout the\n... vote versus with yeah just to see that or just to see [noise] a comfortable which is I don't want us to come to it I think it's similar to wishing handle somebody you can be able to actually change their life ... bring up something about just by thinking about that\nBut would you want to it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to to not do that you don't have to\nThinking about potatoes to ferry in common than ritual magic and several emotional thing to do and when you have to check on your least psychologically changing something in your south to de ... during it\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the Mel for that mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though a new Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know is it true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago University's School of business and an expert in magical thinking my way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work\nAnd so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world so where did he superstitious or choose to kind of beliefs come from do you think that\nHave them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example who are always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is the way that he respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit in the museum about voodoo and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was off before I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it just so chasing it with the bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different era stick which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake ness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how\nA very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nSo yes there is like psychology there is a science to lock\nPops amazing so what kinds of principles these lucky or unlucky people living that lost by some kinds of things were they doing different needs to each other one the key principles is that they are more open to opportunities so they tend to have a gold Israel\nSo in terms of being happy and healthy and what's happened but how they were going to get bad really very open to different groups through or certainly met somebody a poppy seed\nAnd she said well that's an interesting costs now keep in touch with that person or that they will go along route where I'm lucky to the polls are often stuck in a rough go one way which they intend to be successful in relationships will help for whatever it is and they stick with that\nNo matter what happens so that kind of flexibility behavioral flexibility is very important I there's some experiments that you haven't done the kind of showed the differences between those people who identify as white count out for a long time and space experiments so for example might help them flex or newspaper and\nThey might be opportunities in that newspaper a big ... saying you know till the experiments you've seen this and when a hundred pounds\nAnd the lucky people checks are ... lodge what's called a ... by their very relaxed and so they sit literally same over the world ... there's opportunities while but I get my money\nAnd give them the money and all that lucky but still\nThe unlucky papal very anxious about themselves right small spotlight literally don't see there's opportunities lucky people so optimistic thing ... uh that like work out well for them and so because of that they've already Brazilians went bad things happen they will bounce back because these underlying belief in the future good things will will come a balance\nUnlucky people exactly the opposite to mistake for example if you give people a salary of him such as a young when you walk into a bank to name the robot like fire a gun and the bullet hit you in the arm you're lucky you I'm lucky you seen massive\nDifferences in which white rich people respond to that sticks recently of the lucky people going oh my goodness we're lucky day because we might talk to my head just my um [noise]\nYou know if I Need some time off work which can be a great lucky break the unlucky people go while you even asking the question I've just been shot in the arm the lady unlucky side which\nIs very simple experiments often you quite profound insight into people's different mindsets\nIn some ways even come full circle at the beginning of this program we heard how magical police are sometimes there was all about brains making fools connections and getting things from\nThe riches reached that seem to show that believing you're lucky can become self fulfilling and actually make you more lucky off to hearing Richards advice maybe I Will try to adopt the mindset of the lucky pass and stop staring at the pavement and\nBe a bit more open to opportunity\nWhy don't chat to that person in the elevator or look on the positive side a bit more you never know if it's a must sell\nTo sign up for this week that sit for this notion of proud science on the b._b._c.

to an end to Seoul any faith can give us as to why not maybe oh you've\nHow likely it is to be true because the brain by ... have said they put a whole lot of evidence together one of the best evidence that very strongly rejected by the technology companies\nThat's right yeah I think Bloomberg said he it's been investigating for twelve months have Seventeen inside his including former spies\nAs those people who have apple and Amazon certainly if you are a nation state then yeah and you could do something like this they should just be tough I Would because you know it's a growing area video and if it was that ideal back door then yet absolutely you'd want to do it\nBut equally you're on TALK to quite a lot of security companies and they say that you know there's been a big sea change in the way those nation states operate\nThe getting less and less about the big ticket to the operations and that's certainly what they would have been because\nYou're talking about involving people in a factory you talking about changing the production line you're talking about a lot of people it's a lot of moving parts that to coordinate and you know China may have\nA good handle on the loyalties of those people but you gotta think at some point someone something similar would get out and it would be more obvious that this had happened\nAnd I and I think that the change that we've seen is that those ... those nations and now going from which will stealthy campaigns\nAt that tend to use the kinds of techniques that you see from you know just your standard organized criminal because that makes it much easier to hide where's this is you know it's a fairly obvious way you're gonna point the finger if something images from a Chinese factory with a sponsorship on it\nAnd I face whatever is or isn't going on in this particular story at least it's not what unity to think about vulnerabilities that could be in the supply chain and ask a space quite an important question ... whatever's going on here how feasible that would be any way at the level of manufacturing to put a little surveillance\nChip and ... device ship that device and then have that chip active I when it said put into a server and the United states or the u._k. or wherever\nYeah but that's one of the Jewish aspects about the story is that a ... I don't think Bloomberg said that they should have been turned on I think that it was it sort of they they think they go ahead of the cove and they called it before the\nUm the sponsors of whatever activates there but I think some technical analysis that did look at the evidence we did put forward\nAnd he said if you are going to do if you if you if you pick this fall from the circuit board the plane but I didn't want to be a great place to do it because it it seemed to that data or is it flowing across you know from one possible to another so yeah it's feasible and certainly the\nUm there's been warnings from the FBI about supply chain attacks and we've seen some very successful ones happen suddenly for self on the software by says but less on the hunt but it's certainly one of those things that\nThe bad guys know about and trying to get ... get into this long change 'cause then used in fact one widely used but the software and it takes care of the distribution for you and you know they they can be very effective but at the moment which is wasting not definitive wood and on both sides there's competing claims\n... and I certainly all that says mark ward talking to my editor on\nWhat out how to make the incidents of things and Internet of even more things because the things need to communicate with the other thing that's how it guys now that connectivity is why this effort to be why this unique devices to have a little antenna an aerial to transmit to receive the signal\nWell things have moved on since I use the metal ... hanging as my collar area if you hit the guy because now we're talking about ... minutes or you can spray or you can paint them on a surface\nAnd then not a technology sector will say well Jody about cycled hexagonal last seven or eight transition metal ... ... ... ...\nChoice you were watching that down but they were if they just go these materials ... that's all you need to make that code Maxine professor eureka go see at Drexel University in Philadelphia has recently been speaking at a conference on the subject in Sweden\nFrom where he spent a few minutes to tell me why the whole idea of Mac seems as antennas has become so well received\nWere very very happy with the result because Rita antennas that she made not only can get fortune any surface brings to spray age on the surfaces but they're also showed excellent performance\nYou make it all sounds so simple that you have these magazines I just a few atoms thick and then you can pay the most spray them onto a surface and suddenly you end up with an inside a bit like the one on your face is it really that simple\nWell if it is that same poll I Would not take us through the years that right [laughter] or to develop them by as soon as they know how to get\nFlakes or is that right size with ... as the know how to make an inch of good quality films and they contact each has a veil and conduct electricity has a continuous field\nAs we learn how to
