I mean we are we are getting close now to a potentially being out for that tournament\nMatthew thank you know the decision on whether Brett Kavanaugh should become a Supreme Court judge has come to dominate us politics Republicans and Democrats to sharply gifting beans and they televised hearing into allegations of sexual misconduct against the judge\nOn friday the FBI was asked to investigate those allegations so what exactly will involve David go Mrs retired FBI special agent who knows this particular procedure well I often for more details on the scope of the investigation\nWhat we know from media reports is that the president has or what's known as the supplemental back Robin justification oh what judge Kavanaugh to take a look at the allegations that were raised during the testimony before in Senate confirmation hearing\nIs a weak enough because Democrats and others are saying that simply not enough time to get to the buffet some of some of the issues are arriving here as a write off to fish will deadline\nWell it may not get to the bottom of every issue but it's certainly enough time from the FBI to complete the task that they've been given initially from the president\nAs I understand that the task was to interview for a of individuals whose names were brought up during the hearing professor for more just in Mr Smith and that was before name that I don't recall all of whom can either corroborate doctor for organ corroborate\nA judge Kavanaugh's versions of events that's a very small task actually very simple to locate it in your view those people regarding the allegation\nMark judge of course this is the friends of Brett Kavanaugh who's are accused of being present when some of the alleged issues took place he said that you know he doesn't recall ... problems or is that some of the statements somebody accusations simply wasn't true\nWhat ten FBI agents sitting in front of him do differently to ... to find out if he is saying holds water will not\nWell one thing that happens when the FBI comes up to interview you is that there is an admonition usually the book or the false statements to the FBI is separate crime from anything else that they might be investigating so there is\nA a good reason for a person to tell the truth but the second thing is the FBI investigators there'll be sending out our experience investigators they're independent of politics and the process\nThey want to provide a balance look at the allegations and their skills are getting people to confide in them where they might not complied with the press the media or or partisan politician so the hope is that they will ah open up to the FBI and perhaps\nTheir memory will be a\nWill be stimulated by the uh the occasion they'll provide additional information that may lead other other places\nAnd is it your under our understanding that the FBI would that have the authorization to do those subsequent interviews for quiet\nWell that's a that's a question of kind of up in the air the president seemed to indicate that they could follow the lead to where they wanted to go but there may be some conflict with the office of legal counsel which works for the president this is all going to depend on what the director ... director Christopher Wray tells his age and if you want them to do\nI truly believe that there will be able to follow a logical leads what the president will probably not allow them to do is to go out into other\nAllegations that are not related to the one created made by a doctor for or any of the other people that are are authorized for interview this was still in negotiations with the with the Senate so we'll have to see how it plays out in the next seven days\nOnce they do complete that investigations within the scope of whatever is allowed to them within the scope of the time what happened next to do they give a recommendation did they say yes this person is state for example to be a judge on on the Supreme Court\nNo and background radiation the FBI never provides a recommendations or conclusions the agents in the field who are conducting these interviews and will will not actually\nHave any input into summaries that are provided to the White House in the report in the investigation they will simply complete their their interviews send them electronically to FBI Headquarters where they will be\nCorrelated and placed in the report and there will be an executive summary of the contents of the\nInterviews at the beginning and that will be provided to the White House\nAs David ... is a

... is the editor in chief of the left wing Israeli magazine plus nine seven to welcome to the program my co what is the residents refused to go what will happen you will they go ahead and bulldoze\nTheir spinach\nBail bulldozed the village and forcibly displaced a presumably the the residents to a different location ... ah\nJust remind us said why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere is this your levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other is she has a place here one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority is and ah most world leaders forcibly displaced saying they're protected population in occupied territory is anything from a war crime to upgrade breach of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's a place of the west bank where is\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements come in to replace them where there's already settlements their existing there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank\nTwo different pieces I'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of peace Dale ... and it would also cut off East Jerusalem which many people are\nBy the Palestinians and much of the world believed to be a will be the capital of the of the Palestinian state and then cut it off from the rest of the west bank\nA piece of people have been living here since the Nineteen fifties now these rainy government said the structures we built on state owned land without comments from the Israeli miniature he which undid the Nineteen Ninety three ... seems to have control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C suggests this fall within ...\nIt does the rest of his claim that it's actually privately on land owned by a a nearby Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of one of the smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permits of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government that describes ... says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative place to go to despite\nInternational objection to this has they being an alternative pacing where would that be then\nThere is it's a location not too far away um\nIt's also very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine it's not\nIt's not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problem to have with it

Hammond is the present of health check on the BBC will set us\nSo we found that forty percent of the people in that age group said that they often will very often felt lonely and then gradually as people get older that number went down but still over Seventy five twenty seven percent was saying that they are always often felt lonely\nNow of course these figures are quite high and it's partly it was it was on lines that people could decide themselves whether to take part so that made it might have made them a bit higher of rule but I think what is really striking is these differences between the age groups\nSo that people were telling us that they felt disconnected that they felt left out\nI'm On that they didn't fail\nYou know a comfortable in the neighborhoods necessarily that they wasn't somebody they could um you know bar a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nBut why is that is it because older people are more resilient to worries about loneliness\nI think that's really good point I think one of the things is that we know that\nWhen you're very young it is a time when people feel emotions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness and older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and they usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the loneliness of all they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think ... something about life I think the main ways of being the case it was just never measured before may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's\nInteresting because there's going to ask about social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is a lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what would it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas that nobody makes eye contact and that in itself can be quite lonely right\nYes and we did all the the ... if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and also and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type parks\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then and I'm from the U.S has kind of comparable levels of letting us and India but it was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they had higher levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other ... and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent does not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister added to see I told you set up time levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with as which is what you were pointing to in being in\n... and how do you solve this though what's the strategy well we off people ... solutions they founded what for that and the closer to something as big as this to find out what is

obviously sometimes easier said than done\nAnd I I thought was interesting that you start the conversation with anyone because it hasn't got to be deep meaningful long conversations that people have that can alleviate loneliness chanting somebody when you buy your paper in the shuffle or your milk ... or whatever those little things remind us we connect to everybody else in the real human number

I think that's the biggest difference between for example the ... sakes whether that will make heat wave aware\nThat when he ran in Europe and now we ... we had any way to get it all in Europe including people that were also a heat wave shorter one at different times over the summer and the rest of the northern hemisphere and I think that well that's kind of what we ask\nWell maybe but I haven't\nThe hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all kinds of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be held comma\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks chops a gruff tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades\nThe first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event but which now ranks at least nine ... among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann that makes it these global averages early parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about unprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires\nThat are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens it in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of after all those happen every year\nOf course you know right let one go what is not necessarily harming our what we can protect the reasons why we do ... any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that can be quite rare and it's now a relatively calm and and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived herds of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soil she got worst droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is defective climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer and warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts\nUh so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nIn part that's because the flip side of those heat waves in the Americas Europe in Siberia as being a cold ... system was over the north pole but that's little comfort to you\n... says there's a strong decline in Arctic ice is still in evidence for him the trend ... twenty seven\nI Would say that this summer circulation patterns we had in two thousand seven if that happened today we would have a new record low because it was a very unusual summer as well not in terms of a big storm coming in and you had this high pressure that persisted over the Beaufort Sea\nAll summer long and under high pressure you tend to have clear skies do you have a lot of solar radiation hitting the ice that that was that high pressure was coupled with low pressure over Siberia for example\nAnd so what that did is they created a very strong pressure gradient between the high and low pressure centers which brought warm winds from the south into the Arctic Sea funneled all this warm went into the Arctic he also pushed the ice away from the coast of Siberia and Alaska towards the north pole\nAnd you help flush more I set of friends straight so all of those things happened\nAnd that was able to college at first to record low that we saw in two thousand seven which also took scientists by surprise because we didn't think you could lose that much ice that quickly\nAnd it did show that the ice has become quite vulnerable to these unusual atmospheric patterns because the ISIS than enough now that if you have\nA very strong circulation pattern that sets up that will favor ice melt you going to lose a lot of ice very quickly\nIf you have a storm come in and depending on the time of year that it comes in and where it comes in because you have a vulnerable ice pack because it's then it can create a lot of damage and so what's happened in the Arctic is is the weather is benign you're still going to have less sea ice but it won't be as dramatic\nBut if you have a dramatic weather pattern that comes in you're going to lose a lot of ice very quickly\nAnd I think that's what we're seeing is just that vulnerability has increased for having a dramatic ice loss event\nIt's definitely a measure of when not if for the melting records will be broken\nAnd it was the opposite because he's the rapidly changing conditions there but many scientists suspect artist stapling Weber far away I'll be talking about back in next week's edition of discovery with the BBC and those pushing the view include climatologist Michael Mann\nWho says we should smog up to the connection between global warming and changing whether\nGlobal warming doesn't cause a meter logical event\nTo happen what it does is it can take that event and it can intensified in various ways hurricanes can become stronger they can carry more moisture with them and deal more flooding potential and or even these mid latitude storm systems can become much greater flooding threats in these high pressure centers in the summer\nAre becoming deeper and hotter and that's where we're seeing record breaking heat and drought and wildfires break out so it's intensifying these weather systems in a way\nThat is doing great damage and it's a relevant to ask to climate change you know caused this storm to form it's a question we can never really answered the better question is once the storm began to form was it intensified by climate change\nAnd we now have great confidence that in many ways the answer is yes [noise]\nThis is member supported Ninety
