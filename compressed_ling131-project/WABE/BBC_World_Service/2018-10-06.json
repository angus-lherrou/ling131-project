England at least welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me\nDescribe the feminist five ... a bit more about the\nShore um well in twenty fifth Cain there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China\nWho wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers at subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThat Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women ... where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually productive at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... say the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as it was completely unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered salmon a papal inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nAnd much more broadly defined really are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described but how much would they representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise] well\nThis is a thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected a by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women and China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiteral debris luggage didn't have a wood too as well I'm Emma may be a question to lead to\nThose high is it and I want to see you said is going today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect to me to kind of on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles\nThere's very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S square on the news about Harvey Weinstein sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations\nBut there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed\nTo do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China\nHave virtually no recourse and yet made to has really\nCan off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women are emerging up all across China um across sectors even across class coming out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse for\nAnd the way you relate to others because that is very identity base as well but also your social networks they're breaking informing breaking informing in that time it's a time full of instability\nWhen he was some students at Yale University and an opening than he do seem to know what it's like to feel lonely\nI was really excited to investigate because it symptoms of one issue for ages\nBut I feel like I've built up too much in my head and I saw it was like not quite disappointed when I got hit but like I think pressures week is really oversold like me to best week you're likely oh your friend I was a bit of ... I Wish I'd push yourself out andme all to me I think ... was\nFeeling like you want to be able to talk to people but not knowing how like I'd lots of like sort of superficial acquaintance friendships but I don't take up many if you look at everybody talks about ...\nMore than I did for me it's about ... the no free lunch you were a part of the community that you're in very limited\nOstracized if you're on the weekends I struggle friends all around as much I Do like Sundays I as a family as well so I definitely saw the ones on days when having much going on\nA remote as well so lonely but for the plumes of I'd give it to the parents or just from friends or new looking for food or do you live at all but people can reach out food if I was feeding switched over\nMy window and it's just a law student I mentioned that it doesn't always last long so maybe it's a very normal thing to feel at that age and can often be temporary yeah\nSo that's that's another reason that I think uh we are seeing such high levels of loneliness and younger people is that\nUh when when they experienced it they don't realize necessarily that this is something that can often be temporary\nAnd they also don't haven't rehearsed different ways of coping with it and what works and what doesn't which in itself might make it last longer so the whole intensity of the experiences is is higher because of course you don't know you can get out of it to or how to get out of it\nSo yeah that's very much that is very recognizable\nIs it possible that older people might feel lonely in the same numbers but feel like ... ... ... didn't want to say in the study that they feel and me\nIt's very possible of course because there is indeed\nA perceived stigma associated with loneliness and by that I mean that people have the idea that if you admit to learn in us and then you will be seen as somehow we Korean adequate and we did ask about that and we did find that that was a stronger among older people so it's very possible that\nUm it's it's not entirely clear why that is not the case as much and younger people of course I'm a buck but indeed that was the case what's also interesting to think about is that we did try to to delve into that stigma and try to see well are people who admit to being\nA really and negatively evaluated are seen as weak arena adequate and we actually found no evidence for that so our participants our fifty five thousand participants were generally very kind about other people who feel lonely and very um positive about them wanting to reach out and help\nSo it is perceived stigma but not so much stigma that actually exists and I think that's interesting to to speak about so that people realize it actually isn't as bad as they think\nAnd of course it's not a competition between the ages and if you do feel any medical ... now some older people such as Ninety six year old Jack King isolated because then no longer so mobile I went to meet him in a time when he lives on the south coast of England [noise]\nReally nice to meet you I was a souvenir sphere murder is as a prisoner for\n... that's my whole life or does it bought from Boston wow that's a pretty big piece of rocks that fat last you know for free for all of those are rooted in the last hour before the most in the pool\nNow there's no doubt that Jack is someone who was also during history is as a prisoner of war during World War two he put on plays for the other prisoners fashioning stage ... out of rice sacks he also knew how to set up a lizard pie ensued with gas\nBut also the ball he's busy life has been dominated by one relationship with his wife Audrey\n... station ... method my married in September a quick for marriage for sixty five years wow she passed away a few years ago this year\nAnd was that when you started to feel lonely saying huh\nOh yes what is your whereabouts afterwards because there's two ...

[noise] [noise] [noise] but on the road for the windows are looking for the ... and so to an empty but which is very lonely\nThank you how typical would you say as lots of ... and older de da de ... ... what do you think learning it feels like feels like it I like a deep deep weeping and well we're in today well that's\nThe opposite of letting in is is that what would you say\n... that is happening this happen is the opposite of learn and this is happening is\nJack King the only thing to house check from the BBC with me Cody Hammond today we're discussing the results of all study the b._b._c. lending us experiment and professor of mine ... to one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me\nNow with Jack the AC seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see that in a study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your end today\nNo no uh we had a sort of participants believing that line and this is about being on your own but all the rest associate headed with very different things\nAnd I'm surprised to see that faulty one percent of the people who responded told us they think that letting us can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\nHas so much is a little bit like a social service to let's say so when you very very Thursday it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason it's there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning that says a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening in what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by re directing your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where are they you don't pay attention to the science or you can't because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no ... no sufficient for the Latino sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global study and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning is well\nThe short answer is yes we did find learning us in every country and in every age group all over the world\nIn terms of age we can also say that the H trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steep her so that was a big reduction in in loneliness a cross the lifespan than in others but the trend is always they\nAre but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there are nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of letting us well almost the same and the u._k. to us from us and India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to do to my taste Lucas and from the at the university who hails from New Zealand and studies mental health and young people\nSemi weather in the study jak sons of distracting yourself was the one that came out talk but what else was in the top five so\nFirst of all the destruction is a is a really interesting concept because\nAnd I also think of it has some simply you know enjoying being by yourself engaging with things by yourself\nBut of course some people will see that as a distraction if they are if they're feeling bad for example the second one was about joining social groups are clubs and of course you'd want to work for everyone and it won't work if the you've joined the group that is for example not accessible and you have a disability so the group itself needs to be one that is inclusive\nUm the third one was about thinking positively breaking with negative thoughts cycles which is of course a a a really a problem when you are already feeling quite lonely for quite some time so there are techniques a\nPsychological techniques for this to help people get out of those cycles\nBefore is is it an interesting was about starting a conversation with anyone a small moments of social interaction\nCan become big moments of course and I really liked the example of the the person you spoke to who spoke about\nYou know asking people for a cup of tea that's really nice way of preparing to have those those little moments because you do need to know what are you going to say\nBut it's also good example of how ... how cultural this can be and how much it needs to work for you because you know it it it's funny but in in in a British culture of course people want to have tea that's a big thing and\nGet married right so we're not as much as possible yeah by where I come from only people who are ill will have teeth opening up and say\nAnd the number five was talked to friends and family about your feeling exactly which is an interesting one because we found that the people who said that they have high levels of London is less likely to suggest that one suggesting it might be difficult that what what for every one\nOf course it's true and it's it's also true that is to to talk about do you use the word loneliness when saying that might be the most difficult that so it is also about finding ways of talking about the ... necessarily say I'm Alone they\nCan simply be about you know I really would like to to see people more often or you know can we go for that cup of tea every Sunday instead of doing it so sporadically so it is about finding a way to do it but it is a very important one today\nAnd if you want to hear more about the top solutions in debt ... which ones might what best for you to download on you ... how you can feel less lonely we put a link to it on the health ... website\nNow my mother I Know there's a lot of data still few to analyze but what is the main takeaway few that comes out of the BBC letting us experiment so all\nI think one of the things is that uh is is this whole diversions between\nPeople perceiving that there is a stigma and being quite ashamed about feeling lonely but actually the fact that we don't find one we do not find negative views of loneliness and I think is an eye opener\nAnd it's something that we can actually stress more to to liberate people from that pressure of there being a potential stigma about it so that's something I Will want to pursue more\nWell thank you so much for joining us today man when I but I had and thanks for only the hard work on this day to day but you said was pulled them I ...
