reelection says lead up a center right CD policy in December she held that post since two thousand\nSmell the move is seen as an attempt to silence critics in her party and win back the voters who just served it deserted the party the CD you but Mrs Merkel is facing an ultimatum from the coalition's junior partner the STD the center left Social Democrats said the will and there are lines if the government fails to deliver in promises by next year\nThey'll discuss whether we can speak now the journalist Rebecca started my own the international broadcaster deutsche about everybody think he's a

this is I was obviously a big shock even though her her brand on and and there were a that her brand was um has been under question\nEspecially since um since last year's election um but miracle this absolutely took\nAh Germany by surprise yesterday on many people actually thought that the leaders of the coalition partner the ... or Americans the very end sister party to the su they many thought that those leaders would step down before miracle would\nUm so this was obviously a definitely a way to find when some of the critics within her party and also just signal a change in in German politics and say we've listened we've heard the voters and we're we're ready to change something\nShe framing it says us no responsibilities things aren't going well on to lead all take responsibility for that or is it more perhaps about giving her a smooth transition or as she leaves power and the next couple of years I think\nDefinitely served both purposes as well as she she also didn't say that she would be stepping down from the chancellor eight immediately she won't be stepping down\nUntil she intends to not step down and told twenty Twenty one and I think that this gives her enough time in her own party to she said that she won't influence who who will be her successor either\nIf perhaps and the chance to weigh or our as the head of the CD new but it's definitely gives her time to smooth things over to ease that transition and to try and continue to have some influence with in the party that she's lead for the past Eighteen years is definitely gives her that times\nWhy has her popularity way nobody pulse of it just the difficulties of being a ... for so long\n[noise] absolutely I think many people but she has she had absolutely she's been chancellor\nFor for many many years and that people lately have grown very upset with the internal party conflicts with and her conservatives between her CD you and the the su\nAnd a lot of the fighting about um about migration about refugees about those policies that those had taken such focus\nSo associated with her as well her attempt to let that are doing ... ...\nExactly meant lots of it is backlash to that move for a lot of it as well speaking with voters from from the past two key state elections is that they were they were tired of taking precedence over\nDomestic issues as well or or or issues that seem more pressing to the people living here like rent uh their their their pensions um the care homes and things like that\nAnd I suppose it'll be a question is if she voted on her way our old does she have an obvious successor that's\nWhat's going to be extremely interesting as soon as she announced even the report she hadn't even announced that officially by the time at least three people jumped in the rain yesterday saying that they would like to succeed her um\nI think that she got her her pick her she's got her main person in mind and that would be the CDs general secretary ... caught on Bella which the German media has dubbed mini miracle\nUm but there's also to medical critics who are in the running to two people from the more conservative ranch with a party which is going to make it more

I'm not agreeing that the taboos but I think\nIs dangerous octaves risky the one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch ... to me and as a right to living in South Africa who came

how to tell them yet for a lot of my main characters are a bit like me right\nClever though and I mean the age that has always been political in South Africa that all of that any to be a huge today\nI think at the moment there's a real risk you know which he used to having such a history of protests and things are connected to the struggle for freedom on many levels in South Africa and in all kinds of environments most of the opportunities for work for funding to make work is from the government\nAnd I think at the moment there's a real risk of self censorship so of ought to be very aware of

booze Hi my name is ... and I'm the students and the university\nAnd I think even though the taboos or something that come about as a result of like social consensus and usually they're there to like ... sometimes it's a good thing when we don't feel comfortable joking about certain things like the impact of tend to be violence of things like homophobia are so\nHuge that we can't even risks trying to minimize those issues because you give a green light for people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in disciplines where maybe we're making light touch so comedy for example but in film navigating the taboo would look at the difference I think people navigate taboos in ways that show where we stand as a society about those issues ... thank you so\nMuch [noise]\nWhere are we going next over here are hiring malaria pills Hi Eric\nI'm Ree suffer from the censorship is similar to Richard devoting the

week\nWell what are the polls say about the issues the uppermost in voters' minds I've been speaking to leave Marron Gulf director of the Marist College poll on the company ... an independent polling and election consultant first Kathy what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds but I find\nThe most fascinating thing is that the polls which suggest that we have two completely different electorate the Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care\nThat means that it's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they make you think\nI I think there's a tone and the closing days of the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved in to Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issues that ... to talk about in partisan terms is unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished I think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes\nFor key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worse they say well you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are just interesting themselves\nWho are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI think if I may there is relatively\nLittle difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges after a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago\nOn if I also can add something about ... we've had shootings in the United states and we had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence on there's usually a short term effect\nIt it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before the election it's
