case most of the problem and shot\nYeah that that's how the organism is delivered to the contact lens square and if you have a contact lens case it will amplifying the contact lens case invest that

this water contamination which is not a news story\nThe data we've got has amplified what was that before this is the biggest does it's been done on it comes to me but I don't see why they put you on the box is I Can't believe it's getting to really reduce sales the patient support groups that top three or four years ago by some of the affected contact then uses they've designed and there was a sticker\nBut the contact lens comes good printed on the books it's just the sort of red nose re read some of the top on it\nAnd simple information like that would be a big help\nI can still around the pull of coming in and telling us all about the pain and not long night when I ... a professor Joan ... that that Jane sleeping following the outbreak in the ... on the festive August ... and the

on what's going on because of the violence in the region is making it difficult to do the basics including testing people who have suspected cases to see if they actually do have a boat\nAnd the security situation is making it difficult to treat it as a lot of that\nBut it it's hampering lots of things to San Francisco to getting to patients but he's also hampering the purchase of contact tracing so the way you stopping Ebola outbreak is you identify case and then you find every single person they've come into contact to and\nYou mentioned trying to do that anyway in a busy bustling city or a remote part of the countryside is difficult when this conflict happening at the same time it's almost impossible say it's a very difficult joke\nThat the teams from the world Health

Organization's Hayes is now preparing for managing this outbreak into twenty Nineteen now\nAnd so patients have to have the disease all their any treatment setting\nAs you remember from the big IPO the outbreak in West Africa suddenly there were these handful of cases that were treated with experimental drugs things like the map and monoclonal antibodies that attacked the virus well now they are actually being used on patients like on the day that being diagnosed with it but are they getting the drugs\nIn this latest outbreak was only been about fifty so patients who've been given them\nBut these are those experiments with drugs to with talked about but never really used in the last about outbreak really being used on the front lines for the first time\nSo in the end we should be able to find out whether these trucks will ...\nWill have a lot more clinical information about whether or not they work it's worth pointing out as we ...\nThe the the way that you're going to talk about an outbreak is by stopping it from spreading from person to person and this is an interesting uh started and will hopefully be incredibly useful for anybody who's called the disease which don't bring it spreading is the way you're going to talk on the boat Robert\nThanks very much James now next we'll talking headaches and we own a cold that like I get headaches above my left\nLibrary in ... it feels

completely continue like\nBrain damage so that was very interesting and it sounds that they picked up so many of these so called us off itchy and education's so we\nYou could use this kind of equipment across all an income countries what kind of difference but that may\nWe think it could make a huge difference for instance even in a long wait I said we detected forty four of those cases in six months\nThat part in a way has a population books seven to eight million so that will give a ... ... per million combination per year anti tank all the whole population of sub Saharan Africa which is over\n... million\nWe would estimate than that militia eleven thousand ... per year could be detected now obviously some might be detected by other means but this is the most to finish it means and that means that you could save lives and we also know from previous work maybe on the life box that there are an estimated Seventy cars and operate in the world\nThat don't ... they don't have ... the either\nSo we would feel that this is a big number and this is a simple breathing monitor that should be available for all these countries like it is in the developed world\nAnd I sell oven now change before we got this new research on one of our favorite subjects sleep on the discovery in mice I have a kind of keeps which in the brain\nYeah I Do sometimes wonder if we could just do a whole program on Flickr or a whole series on sleep on how good I think we found him I ask how we could do that too now there's just the idea is when you had hits the pillow and funny your sleep is there a single like switching the brain that is flick like a light and then you're going\nAnd this was a study in ... and they found this region in the hub of found most specifically the venture ... pre obtain equal 'cause I Know you on that level of detail quarter after and they should I was essential for sleep so\nHe's a field known as up to genetic so if you genetically modified the mice them as a clever trick way if you shine light on certain parts of the brain you can activate those brain cells so that is exactly what they did they shined a light on these specific neurons and\nThe the ... they weren't\nThey read where they are the fact is ...\nThat's really clever so if you could try and work out how exactly that works and then do that humans we'd all be very grateful potentially I\nTend to have a problem going to sleep it's little children waking me up in the middle of this micro [laughter] we need a slightly different solution to that\nSo many people do this will be amazing if you could have something that just sent you just like just like well this is the idea now that they've been able to show that look this is the mechanism this is how it works at least in mice and I suspect he's probably legitimate to say something very similar is happening in people\nThere is evidence of that certain people with insomnia\nThis region of the brain doesn't seem to be working as well and in people when they go to sleep in the having that brings in this region does like up as well be called genetically modified people in China watching that brings do the same experiments as they've done in ... but there's some evidence the same process happening and people\nSo it might work and it'd be pretty cool if you could just Claudia you're going to sleep at the accidents\nThank you very
