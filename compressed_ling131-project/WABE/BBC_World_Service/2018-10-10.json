for next year it's financial backers include the former for me to one Dr David ... uh\nAnd the chief executive is Catherine bummed me er and she's in the studio with us now I'm going to Catherine I'm the first I Know this question is is there a need\nFor a woman only drivers series there there are women Danica Patrick is the oldest one who's ... who's made huge boxers emerges spoke to mascot ended because in the states not everyone's in favor of this move so what is the reason behind it\nWell if you look for the one that have been nine hundred drivers over the last sixty eight years and I need to if those drivers have been women\nAnd it's forty two years since the last woman driving informant among rice we believe that there's a structural problem in involved major sport say W series is being launched today\nIn order to redress that balance\nUh we're getting to recruit drivers from all over the wild and we're going to train them and we have six races in Europe next year and hopefully um we are going to propel all drivers up into ... we will tell drivers to embrace against men to ...\nTo ... you say it's just a stepping stone to you to kind of balancing things up in the world most sports have rule\nYes indeed major sports is the end you spoke to in the wild at the moment that doesn't have an eight women Sarah's and we're not saying that women and men column rice together uh

... series that that amongst all the others that you just referred to where we were really find out who the false drivers in the wild and we believe that that's going to be very excited when\nThe ...

I think this is dealt with six pilots but his period just before we get to see what has become sort of holding door at the national trade but at the end of the day we obviously congratulate you to waiting to as a state it'd be just let it go all\nThe people as you say can keep changing the problems continue to mount up and not be addressed what do you think needs to be the first thing on the to do list for the new man in office\nI mean despite all congratulating she turned the waiting on these points we do have some racist ... because if you reduce some of the posting on social media\nThat he is posted at the is striking the little league and often seem to be at odds with government\nSimply awful it is it just it posted that he thought the forty percent of the line should be owned by the state South Africa\nSo I think that the first order is for the minister cabbage is is it called a difficult decision was made to be watched a minister terrified he's he was on the economy will have to make those difficult decisions as adults those difficult decisions\nIn states like two weeks talking politics and central to that will be a way the old school art how he deals with the fiscal consolidation in any environment way and all the closest down\nWay down way they are major cost ... particularly in the fall of ... lawyers will probably six to wage\nShannon finance minister dated menu then learns we have almost repeats late for the income and to put a representative food\nBut I Know ... and they will with the business know talk about the ceasefire\nIn northwest Syria which was agreed last month by Russia took a it helped hold off what many people see it would be a a final push by government forces against the last rebel stronghold with all the humanitarian\nDisaster that would have caused um under the plan or the or medicines should now have withdrawn their heavy weapons um and created a new demilitarized a buffer zone but it's unclear today or whether any of that has happened other jihadists than have about five days to leave the zone\nNow the uncertainty is pretty dreadful for the citizens who are ... there are many of them are evacuated from other rebel held areas in Syria you could describe them as ... that because the Turkish border to the north is closed that is no way out the Syrian Government forces\nBacked by Russian power amassing on the board is what will happen and what's it like being in the BBC's Mike Thompson has been talking to people [noise]\n\n\nLike this one rather strong [noise]\n\n[noise] she moved to the streets [noise] some policy\nHas actually fairly typical by on here a new beginning a new day and a new sunrise [noise]\n\nJust for a month ago it was very story as bombs so many of the coin ... began to crumble\nPaul Harvey last night ... there was no\nTo Trump is president among intentionally talking we're sending them make their own businesses might be throwing\nStones ready to see the ceasefire has changed all these ... kids\nFracking the business world 'cause I'm always ...\n... people have to find a way they are no longer a crucial say saving their money in case they have to say you\nKnow people are picking up the pieces of their lives\nI like\nHim and how long we finally made it wasn't a millionaire [noise]\nGetting people from England like ... it's very\nCertainly happy to make you\nKnow how much do you pay and [laughter] [noise]\nWhen my dad what just I'm just going a little posse an enormous memory corona [noise]\nLet's see if we can work away three [noise]\nFive months ago I contacted my in California I was on the line with him from Britain\nAnd I wanted to find out more about the gaming on for ... [noise]\nHey it is you're in the middle of the creation of ... legacy seasons three now wherever you see we create privatized X. amount of mail them out\nAnd we ask people to sit down to record themselves so right now or wait for like ... the slang posted videos we will sit down and watch our on our plate to video\nAnd I have to cook a lot of rewards for myself for example by by make it through an hour or two to ... it would take a shower or go to a gym we\nGo to get through that much video so might tell me about your family will she background\nI grew up in the mid west out in the in the U.S my dad no core bury a big part of my exposure to board games as a kid\nSo we'll games to play\nWhenever they get up to a lot of really dreadful games or early on I got to the standard bearer monopoly clue and a strict ego and whatnot a lot of the stuff that my grandmother had around her farm house they kept all the games there and this giant say\nSay your grandma hit the games away or my mom\nWould want to get in in order to keep the games and some of the border they were they were kept in a closet called the stakes they add lot that I think\nYou can [laughter] that was not my memory that we could I Would go in there and that's about what can you paint me a picture of getting in that for the first time [laughter] whether that was\nThat you know about a dozen games in there and um we pull out of a game of risk and usually we wouldn't know what we're doing we're just going to set up in in butler weight you're\nYou mentioned that the gangs will rule ... disorder actually became ... the way that he approached playing these games ... you're right to find them you would changing uh\nYeah I mean ah when I play the ones that the the farm out there was a matter of just trying to cobble together to rule that we could have any kind of experience but I got to a game at presence\nThe excitement of putting the box and just the thrill of that same question your product and you\nSit down and play it and often it was just dreadful I remember the claim was that was loosely based on space invaders\nWell my uncle is pretty instrumental in this I almost fresh memories of working on that particular game with him flipping over the uh\nThe game is a game called the theater and it had a little star ships and and things that look very exciting to play with so we looked at port over and we spread into the grid of stars on it and a critic sim cards and brought in some poker chips and tried to make again about mining asteroids\nAnd contributed ideas so he was he was an artist and very much into making things and that was kind of contagious\nLooking back who was the creation of the game\nAnd the playing\nVery much though it was a that was making was the fun of it does it totally crash or does it does it work that little cycle they're like create something and then and poke at it and see you know the next one coming out with but it's pretty AJ\nRight well I think that's I think I'm coming up to my time limit on this line at the moment what did you say would be a great time for me to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nAh let's see we've got to be ... or ... or ... or ... or three years we've actually brought a variation this product to Jay in common interests with people in the evening [noise]\nWhen we come on about way he was in the creation of print that make light of the season three he'll watch in small video from across the last ... cells I think he remembered showers war has seen happening\n... rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developed so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better so it's a it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is now it's just about making it better and I certainly will be a story of this scandal but yeah\nThat's right so you came into a month so it's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figured out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce and ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people in it will clays and some railway will begin happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through if he's in three and I'll be watching it with no bad in hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience where how their first game where [noise]\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend\nAt night it's going to be too also a former player game um we're driven off the Internet using Twitter\nAs people I Do not know I've never met a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard you\nKind of like an old high on the phone I Know I don't think that's what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get ... rich state of being in a room sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to the interviewer as much as possible\nTo find the discipline that you don't want to see the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really stuck you know I don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I rely on the real fat and this is where we find out where the whole homes are [noise]\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world ... came ... to ... to like see the ... pandemic [noise]\nAre always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is very\n... language so we will finish our rule book\nWho will send it off their translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or how to meanings if we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nOr languages from other countries so term ... game design\nYeah him in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be goal they all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on the cover you just won't sell in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of a language you have to think of how people played\nSo it was kind of post food German fatigue with combat games and things like that is that feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit in\nTo work all German names that I Need some in Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict they added designed games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I've been taking anything from you know I just prevented you from getting some things\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better [noise]\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game designer over the past Twenty years just from the host more aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred gays develop their general tone on selling gangs of everything you can imagine how it was about ...\nCreations of supernatural steam punk is tempting to think in a world of PlayStation or an X. box to the ... trade current that speaking to him about his career\nOut that the work that he said it's still having a ... influence on the way that we live now\nWhy I moved out to Silicon Valley in Nineteen eighty seven I got a job at a ... corporation started apple so it was like this exciting sexy job as Billy happen to lead the Midwest and and make my ... California\nI think I ... for a month before I got laid off and really got it got a sense of what it's all really lifestyle as I said I don't know much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover so you just kinda got adept at at switching jobs and you maintain that big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd and the right in saying that you were working on what was ...\nI think what we found is that uh if you are yourself you connect with people in a more true way on line and that this whole notion of being anonymous has a lot of pitfalls as well as advantages [noise] I'm In games they create a separate debate to separate or like people caught a magic circle\nWhere you can adopt these other percentage center role playing game you can take on a different character and it's a safe place\nThat does have all agreed to the rules a vaccine\nPrototype was packed casually away and it'll keep changing the forward to release in ... thousand in Nineteen [noise]\nIt was time for the full games testers to head back to the real world huddled Kathleen Greg ... but had something to say about that relationship with the online world\nThat three of us work in the film industry and she works in publishing\nAnd so like all of us are constantly using our devices to communicate with other people in our fields and like this will be something that's always sat at the forefront of our own Hampshire we sat here and wait for hours of his game tonight and I looked at my phone one track the John who am I\nIn our thirties like taking time out of our Saturday and you know like this is just like oh we're ... we're going to go hang out this is a very bland Erie and I've been that we do every like every other weekend and\nThe interaction is everything just there's so much better like I've I've all but stop playing video games\nOh I think we all get Internet and social media the heat and like I Am definitely trying to cut back and not just 'cause I think it's healthy but it it gets kind of repetitive and boring you know and\nAnd sometimes I mean the Internet as well like shrinks the world that allows you to connect with people who are far away but I think we're always speaking connections we want to touch and reach out to as many people as we can but\nI think a lot of times it's better for our own mental state to stop reaching so much and just calm down and just be in the momentum and just enjoy yourself in the moment\nAnd we'll start looking for something out there somewhere out you know the the here and here now and just enjoy the people who are around you\nWhat do you think these kind of game playing it's so popular I Know\nI I don't I Can't explain the phenomenal growth in the industry and it's been growing like ten to twenty percent year every year like like crazy um I Do wonder if people do want some way to kind of connect with each other [noise] away from their devices [noise]\nMaking a connection is important to you to\nYeah I mean some of my favorite stories or when people talk about how this game really brought me closer to my dad for even just today about a guy came up to me and said\nI'm just really see my marriage you know when they tell you they don't like the ... yeah yeah and that's not the first time I've heard that nah I really got me closer to my wife but today it was the I Would say by Maris\nThe game gave them an experience that

and that kind of this world that more people up into space and it tasted point made her cell based may and you know I don't know if that's still true or how long that will hold true but you know I

correct me if I'm wrong but it cost something like three hundred thousand dollars\nFor like three hundred thousand dollars yeah was keeping the expense\nAnd that price has come down considerably how much would a burger today costs\nIt's it's hard to tell you can only do calculations because for the price to come down to force it needs to be scaled up to production that you need to know exactly what the production system is I'm having with a couple of some of\nThat you can scale up to about twenty five thousand leader bioreactor which comes out about ten thousands of me for ten thousand people a year that price will be around ten dollars for a number of the costs will be ten dollars for their costs and it's of course the old way too high\n\nBut even in this country and never no cellular grown meat on the menu the offering were strictly vegetarian including burgers and hot dogs make some plants but not from the sounds of animals\nThat's partly because no one has scaled up to a level where they can feed hundreds of people at once but it's also partly because of regulations or lack of them if just done start selling that fried chicken later this year\nIt likely won't be at a restaurant in the United states\nSo we figure out are regulatory situation us or we could do it here but it's much more likely to be outside the United states or him for countries that we're we're

mean the vast majority of people who you meet are not in the United states the vast majority producing this world is produced outside the United states\nSo I I really don't have a a a a preference whether it's in the u._s. or Beijing or Hong Kong or Japan or Western Europe which could make it happen\nAnd when you say we've got to make it happen we're ready to go have you figured out scandal do
