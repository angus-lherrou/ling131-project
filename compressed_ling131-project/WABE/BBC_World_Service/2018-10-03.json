use the right the amount of material\nWe have all been privileged to watch Schumann Brahms and other great so the silver screen agonizing over the keyboard as they search for the right to him\nWe've all seen Jimmy Cagney as George ... dramatically alone on a stage with solitary work light picking out the immortal note so over there\nOr Cornell Weill\nThis show parent ... the knock turned an e flat\nBut ... not the struggle is real\nBeethoven to share it in that struggle we know from his notebooks that he wrote down fourteen versions of the melody that opens the second movement to the symphony for teens versions over a period of eight years this is the way we know it today\nSketch for this goes this way\nOr\n\nAnother sketch for the same mellow day is quite different\n\nAfter eight years of experimenting with eleven others he ultimately combined the most interesting and graceful elements of all versions and finally arrived at the tune which is familiar to us now\n\nBut now that he has his theme the real work begins now comes the job of giving symphonic meaning to the theme and this meaning becomes\nClear only after we arrived at the very last note of the entire movement does the famous for notes are not in themselves\nSusceptible of meaning in the music appreciation sense they are really only a springboard for the symphonic continuity to come\nIs the real function of what is called for him to take a sort of varied and complicated half hour journey of continuous symphonic progress in order to do this the composer must have his own inner roadmap\nHe must have the ability to know what the next note has to be to convey a sense of right now is a sense that whatever notes exceeds the last is the only possible notes that can happen at that precise instant\nAs we have said Beethoven could do this better than anyone but he also struggled with all his force in the doing\nLet's try to follow this struggle graphically\nTo begin with Beethoven chose seven different instruments with which to begin his first movement the flute clarinet first violence ... violence viola cello and base these seven instruments appear on the first page of his manuscript score\nBut there is something crossed out\nThe part of the flute so we know that Beethoven for one second was going to include the flute\nWhy did you cross it out but let's hear how it would have sounded with the flu left in [noise]\nThe hype typing notes of the flu don't seem to fit into the generally rude and ... atmosphere of the opening bars\nBeethoven clearly wanted these notes to be a strong masculine occurrence and she therefore orchestrated entirely with instruments that play normally in the register of the male singing voice\nThe flute being the instrumental equivalent of the soprano would be intruding here like a delicate lady at a club smoke\nSo out came the flute and now let's hear how masculine it sounds without him\nYou see a lot of us assume when we hear the symphony today that it must have spilled out of Beethoven in one steady gush clear and right from the beginning but not at all\nBeethoven lift pages and pages of discarded material in his own writing enough to fill a whole book\nThe men rejected rewrote scratched out tore up and sometimes older to passage as many as twenty times Beethoven's manuscript looks like a bloody record of a tremendous inner battle\nOr before he began to write this wild looking school or Beethoven had for three years been filling notebooks with sketches\nSome that he ultimately discarded is not right\nI have been trying to figure out what his first movement would've sounded like if he had left some of the men I have been experimenting with the music speculating on where these sketches might have been intended for use and putting them back into those places to see what the peace might have been had to use them\nAnd I've come up with some curious and interesting results\nLet's see what they are\nWe already know almost too well the opening bars of this symphony\nNow once Beethoven had made the strong initial statement but then how does he go on to develop it\nIt does it like this\nBut here is a discarded sketch which is also a direct and immediate development of the theme\n\nNot very good and not very bad taken all by itself but\nIt is a good logical development of the opening figure out what with the music sounds like if Beethoven to use the sketches the immediate development of his the we can find out by simply putting the sketch back into the symphony and it will sound like this\nIt does make a difference doesn't it not only because it sounds wrong to our ears which are used to the version we know\nBut also because of the nature of the music itself it is so symmetrical that it seemed static\nIt doesn't seem to want to go anywhere\nAnd that is fake all at the outset of the symphonic journey it doesn't seem to have the mystery about it that the right version has all that whispering promise of things to come\n[noise]\n\nThe sketch music on the other hand get stuck in its own repetition\nJust\nDoesn't build and Beethoven was first and foremost a builder\nLet us look at another rejected sketch here is one that sounds like this again it is based as all of them are on that same opening figure\nOr\nNow my guess is that he would have used it somewhere in this passage [noise]\nNow that she had the same passage with the discarded sketch included\nThis gets Justin Trudeau itself into the living flow of the music and stands there repeating grounded until such time as the music and again take off in its flight\nNo wonder Beethoven rejected for he of all people had a sense of drive through his music that his second to none\nThis sketch just doesn't drive\n\nAgain like the first one static and stuck\nNow this sketch is different it has real excitement and build\nI suspect it was intended for a spot a little later on in the movement here\nThis is certainly one of the most climactic thrilling moments in the movement it just the beginning of the code of the last big push before the ... and let's see how it would have sounded using the sketch I just played you [noise]\nIt has logic ended bills but what Beethoven finally did use has so much more logic and builds with so much more ferocity and shock\nThat there is no comparison\n\nMm Mm

currently under investigation for corruption [noise]\nSo it's not just a few corrupt politicians are parties in Brazil it's a whole system that's rocks and\nWhat we're trying to accomplish here is to change the dynamics of Brazilian politics by bringing new blood we've extremely qualified people to a Brazilian politics\nIt ought to ... years working with private equity but last year she got fed up with business as usual is NGO slash school for politicians heading off a battery teaches people how to fund and run their campaigns specialists are brought in to help people identify unethical pitfalls\nPowder you spots of the good politician the person who is is a good candidate a good fit for your school\nI Would say three major correct or sticks first is a resilience\nYou have to keep your head up and you know there will be ups and downs second point is ah having like a history of delivering not a history of just talking you know we believe that we need the people who you know can roll up this leaves them get things done and the target is the willingness to serve\nSo we believe that we need to bring that back to the table and so people understand that thing when they are voting for someone they're hiring someone to do the job that they can't do that\nBut even if they're very qualified people it's a very tough system to get in because there's a lot of corruption and those who are corrupt to have a lot of advantages and that's so can an honest person make it in this world at least enter politics\nI think they can if you do any research with Brazilian folders they do essentially give you two answers that they're fed up with the current politicians\nAnd that they would like to see new practices and new individuals and we felt we had to start somewhere\nSo the political renovation which is an aspiration of the president's society as a whole we'll start in the two thousand in Eighteen election and will most likely continue and will grow over the next few years\nBusiness mounted what a move speaking to the BBC thing again is that well as a reason corruption in Brazil is so deep seated with the state to huge employer in many parts of the country\nLocation of the contract for my hands with fewer elected officials politicians are in a position to siphon off huge sums if we want to to finance their own reelection campaigns Sarah mostly the correspondent for the economist magazine in Brazil is seen this for a self when she was did the town of ... and the country's northeast\nWhat do you see the town of around twenty eight thousand people in the poorer northeastern state of ... and basically the morning I got there I had planned to spend the day with a a city councilman and by nine in the morning he had\nA crowd of people lined up outside his house very poor people with little bits of paper their prescription medicines receipts for\nX rays and other medical procedures their gas and electricity bills you know the rest actually just knowing that there was an election coming up and there was kind of an exchange that went on where he took care of these\nFinancial problems they had to pay their bills with the kind of implicit promise that they would support him in the election and this is a town where the biggest employers the mayor's office you is actually a rival to the\nCouncil man that I was with and you know across town the mayor's office was distributing these food basket\n... people are buying well politicians local politicians are effectively buying votes I guess because they control the mayor's office and in Brazil controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nRight they've got all these savers going on and actually outright the buying as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or twenty five dollars and then what happens is the mayor of this town basically tries to get all of the people living in this town to vote for the politicians that\nHe's in a coalition with an in this case it's a prominent senator and a congressman and she depends on them to be able to get federal money to do projects and give these kinds of handouts and then higher\nThey depend on all of these small scale mayors to get the votes that are needed to keep sort of re electing then a lot of them have half a dozen corruption cases\nYes and of course no way you're probably in the world has made corruption cases in seems was the last five or six years of and Brazil has won a national political level the anti corruption agenda has defined a large part of this national election though isn't it\nHas indeed and whoever is elected president is going to have a really tough time getting rid of corruption because there's a whole system that brings it and that starts in these little towns and then worked its way up some of the things you need to\nAbout Brazil is Brazil has massive electoral districts so everyone in al ago as are voting for the same legislators and in this case there's four hundred and forty different candidates that they're going to have to choose between for various positions\nKind of huge array of candidates combined with thirty five political parties means that elections are really expensive so there's a need for money in some cases from legitimate places and in other cases as the corruption investigations have shown over the past few years it comes from outright graft\nIt seems almost impossible to anyone and to keep yourself clean\nSome of the politicians who of and a raft and these corruption scandals say it's the system itself that requires that I think that's a bit of a cop out there have been movements to make elections cheaper\nTo reduce the number of parties and huge ban corporate donations but what's really difficult is all of these reforms once that disgusting Congress they encounter massive resistance from the politicians because of course that quite like this this and that kept them in power for so many years and\nA reform minded congressman or president as I think we'll see when the election is over to really change the way that politics work and the role of money in politics in Brazil\nSarah Muslim of the economist magazine so we'll be election change kind of thing the success of the official call Marshall love ... investigation was thrown open the extent of the corruption problem a federal\nThis
