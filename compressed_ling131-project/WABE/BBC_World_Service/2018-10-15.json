what men can do and get away with and what women can do to actually being taken seriously\nYeah or I should just articles that brought commoner denies all those allegations and that was a scene throughout the the hearings but but\nHere's the the basic question I have for you because your analysis of the way society works and you'll you'll work on this is what you call into sexuality it's it's become extremely influential across America would it be fair to say that you see\nThe the key components in society in America today as being ... on Groupon identities rather than individuals who is that a fair reflection of how you see things\nWell I see things in terms of structures that make your group identity\nA subject to a ... this empowerment our power so the entire a conversation that

too much grouping is\nA response to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nAnd so having a quote from someone who is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr lazy Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean that gender is insignificant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know this guy is a problem\nI I get I get the into sex now the argument that you can bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get that I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull them groups\nWell many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the difference is I think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are\nEvery thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president they feel about Morocco bummer 'cause he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and oh gee beat the Americans not as a little known since I he said I go\nThe easy answer is that a Facebook group first of all can you trust Facebook in our environment in our platform you own your own data which is really key you can control your environment you can control the experience your members have so that's a really big deal if there's more secure you think you'll have proof [noise]\nProof is a strong word I Would never things that's nothing is ... ... if I weren't enough to know that\nBut it is very very secure an encrypted we're actually integrating biometric security from UNICEF into our platform so you can actually have full biometric written a recognition facial recognition voice recognition to get in and we're also implementing block teen technology which will increase the privacy and security of the data\nIn ... in the companies the private sector people you speak to the clients who have come to you [noise] do you get the feeling that there is a growing demand that we need I suppose for this kind of sharing off of the Web the Web has become such a hostile environment for many companies isn't it\nAbsolutely and that's I think what we're really picking up on when we started five years ago\nI had to explain what community was and now everybody understands community everybody understands that the public social media world has its purpose\nBut it's more about broadcast messaging and advertising and it's not about privacy and security and it's not branded so like when a company puts their page on Facebook they're giving Facebook the right to use their brand\nAnd that's about it a little bit crazy\nDenise Hayman lower says she's now getting interest not just for corporations but UN agencies desperate for this type of clothes secure network

in secret when they find themselves interacting strangers on the line\nI have season tickets to the local basketball franchise\nAnd I never get to go 'cause I'm traveling all the time so I end up selling them on Craig's list a sites\nThose sites want your mobile number they generally want an email address sometimes they want more information and what happens is once that information is on that site it's there forever and so I'm getting calls for the concert that's in town or I'm getting calls for you know the the next local event\nAnd those numbers are impossible block they're impossible to keep out of your general kind of data to use and so what I use my pseudo\nFor is I generate a persona that allows me to sell on Craig's list with a separate set of information separate phone number separate email and when the seasons over I can just delete that identity there's no connection back to me there's no personal information floating out there\nSo Steve the guy who's regularly setting his tickets because he can never make it to the game you you've got one set of numbers on Steve who's actually now called John but you put another email that can email John every time to get those tickets he will never another Steve he's buying from he never needs\nNever needs to know and and I we see this a lot with folks especially people who are potentially at risk on line it's one thing for me\nTo sell Jessica does nothing for women to solve so fall in line and meet strangers that she doesn't know we've all heard about the river stocker or these other kinds of sort of safety risks that folks have on line and I think we've had this kind of a symmetry between the amount of information were compelled to share\nAnd the amount of information we would like to share\nNow we know over time that companies like Facebook and Google and all that\nI really didn't need to know all that information because you are the product the more they know about you the more they can sell you and we want to just shift the balance back to sort of more user center control and we think it's unique we haven't seen anything else like that\nSteve shutting foot founder of tech start up a known to many labs here on business daily from the BBC that there are two business responses to some of the online threats but how bad is it really on these concerns I have a date that just an occupational hazard of life on line Renee something deep\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what your activities are for anybody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat is Larry ... founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications and information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks because as to the ... Web created back in the seventies he believes the more than the Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data and in particular data about you\nI mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily panic about assault someone else's harvesting that data particularly if they're getting a free service in return if it's a social platform or something else\nThey may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely\nAnyone so what is the ... if there was this architectural weakness well\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person wants that are corporation wants that our government wants but\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Ken burners Lee has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out as it is now kind of ... being posted that's absolutely\nCorrect and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property in negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them or that are bad in their future\nSo I think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I\nThe scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the brewery attacks

divisive comments on line is that there's a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with a deliberate intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into harden and cows if I Believe so that it in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIs
