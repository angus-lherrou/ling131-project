secrets comes from being a journalist\nJournalism is all about exposing the truth and making a basically the scene to max change which is why open secrets fascinate me why do people keep them\nWon't vote an ecosystem enables them to examine\nWhat seems to be interesting about open secrets relative to let's say normal secrets is a typical secret is\nPrimarily kept by a single person\nMichael ... is a professor of management at Columbia Business school he's done research into the secrets people keep and it's also developed a theory of secrecy\nYou'd on something or you don't want people to know about her had an experience that you'd rather keep to yourself\nAnd you're sort of the primary gatekeeper that secret now or if there's something like an open secret where say there's something happening in your workplace and you know a lot of people are aware maybe not everyone in for the same reason we're not talking about it 'cause\nIt'll all blow up a number of multiple gatekeepers where any person could speak up any person can sort of\nBlow the whistle but they don't end well stop people from doing that\nI think people are sort of fear the backlash that might happen if someone's trying to rock the boat even for the right reasons I think a lot of people sort of don't want to be in that position where they're the ones who sort of change things because things probably get worse before they get better a lot of\nTimes there's a good person versus to go to the group\nThat children looked at tacit permission to tell\nIf somebody said are you doing OK today they could discern that that person was on their side they would take that opportunity to work through perhaps that they might want to tell that person next time they saw ... percent\nAnd they would not tell any adult\nAnything unless they were not making eye contact with them and they would do it when they were helping their parents after dinner wash the dishes if they were cleaning their\nPool or in a car uh as long as they didn't have to look at the adult because that made them feel uncomfortable\nAnd with adults Michael says another calculation is also made\nPeople are trying to do that cost benefit calculation and you know sometimes it might seem like well why would I have to be the person to speak up any press conference because you know why should I be the one to through all this chaos sort of\nIn front of me and it's a totally reasonable suggestion of kind of like a comments dilemma problem one solution perhaps as banding up with other people so you're not alone\nOr another is to really closely investigate what channels are possible you know a lot of organizations have beyond human resource department employee relations departments where the specific purpose was to bring these kinds of things to the table which can be handled in discreet man practical way [noise]\nPeople can keep open secrets because the ... when they don't want to deal with the consequences whether that be about

especially small packages from developing countries subsidize\nOn China is still considered a developing country under this treaty so it takes to get cheaper rates now Jamie smooth done makes mugs in

those oh Jim he's moved on\nThe big issue that we wanted to tackle was the unfairness between shepherds overlook originating their packets from China versus those who were originating from inside the

White House getting rid of this visit level the playing field for you\nThis is a major step to level the playing field\nThat's in large part because the agreement itself as a one country one vote system in which China is considered still basically a developing country that becomes a very difficult problem to solve it of one country one vote system because China can simply vote against your

inside a crate in Western Australia the ... only being detected before when China America Germany and Canada the discoveries causing a lot of excitement in the science world because it might just hold some of the secrets of planet or as we know it including how the dinosaurs became extinct\nWe now live from puff Australia to do to Aaron ... who heads a team of researchers had cutting university the made the discovery thanks for talking to us on a news day festival just had a little bit more what exactly is ...\nOh it's my pleasure thanks a re died a microscopic mineral that forms when the common minerals or con get squeezed by the crushing pressures during impact very rare\nSo we ...\n[noise] well read I can form out a couple of different sizes impacts but the site we found it in Western Australia near shark bay along\nThe coast or is one of the big ones that puts it in a rare class\nAnd part of the controversy is people in the past it argued about its sides are discovery of read I pushes it into a class that is an extinction class of that that doesn't mean that this impact caused an extinction but it's one of the big ones that's rare in our history\nSo essentially a meteorite crushed to or not is what you've been up just average\nYeah here the uncertainty behind this and why it hasn't and discovered clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamb\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis another catastrophe but over time it got buried and when we want to study at today we need other means to study it so our discovery was made by drill core collected nearly Twenty years ago\nWhile so it's a historical discovery in a sense\nWell think about this if the impact that hit Mexico sixty five million years ago it didn't occur the dinosaurs would still be roaming the earth mammals may not have all that we wouldn't be having this conversation assuredly and so we know the big impacts can cause dramatic changes\nUh to uh to uh earth and the things living on it\nThat impact as a hundred and eighty eighty kilometers in diameter and the one in Western Australia called Woodley we think it's probably much greater than a hundred kilometers in diameter so it's the big one that killed the dinosaurs isn't even twice that size it's a big event\nLast night just off of our income mostly thank you very much for talking to Newsday [noise]\nNow in about Ninety minutes time

models which should call them is try to capture the key relationships in a set of clever equations\nWhat professor Nick stone is saying is that the models economists were using to predict the future assumed that if one bank failed would bounce back and most perfect others but why would prevailing models assume that it crashed couldn't happen when economists note that economic crashes occur with disturbing regularity\nPolitics that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous list because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back\nAt the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation and what that meant was the boom in the past didn't seem to be with us so I Believe is Otis Redding along a cheerful way down the

economics which do not adhere to their ideas including the central insights of John Maynard Keynes incredibly\nSo the new economics simply assumed to weigh the risks associated with crises as well as many other failures such as environmental damage who could lose which one forensic to market economy\n\nWill ... the former chief economist is one of the biggest us banks Citibank believes that it's not a failure to see the crisis coming which condemns economists but rather the fact that we were captivated by new fashions which left us ill equipped to do anything about it\nNobody shows coming seeing a crisis coming not doing that I I don't feel particularly bad about not seeing it's coming it's not that uncommon right my doctor doesn't see my diseases coming either but my doctor can prescribe at least I Hope so the right mix\nOnce that disease has been diagnosed but much of\nThe fashionable economics of the Iraq had ... nothing to say about how to handle the crisis it took us far too long to diagnose disease and responses appropriately there was a school of economics that actually did that was how to handle the crisis was old fashioned getting in economics\nAnd a number of people made that point but then people recommend that fiscal stimulus in the face off a deep recession\nThey weren't using frontier economics or the guy that gets ... graduate schools they are using stuff that if they do remember it from the undergraduate days yeah so do you get onto the searches\nThat rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top

financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which assumed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this that was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nIf you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate I'm going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new

elephants in the room and all the flooding sentences and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you were here is more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible like this before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of Mike say conservative economics seems Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood

important to be left to the economists if you were all more confident the economics of Metra about daily bread rather than something belonging to men in suits we will be better able to smell Iraq when something's too good to be true such as being offered a mortgage when we can't afford to pay its\nBut many people think of economics as very complex and the role of the remote subject how can we come

whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate is going to provide a much broader basis of understanding so that when something new tends up like the threat of trade

Programme let me ask you first and it is that the movement here the special summit for November that's been cancelled could can you still see a deal shape it\nHas to be a movement yes I think it's worth remembering the over the course of the last week when the negotiators have been set down in the tunnel is like ... they have made a lot of progress on all sorts of issues the sticking point remains the R respects doping that is cool in between\nThe negotiators in Brussels and politics back home and that's the problem to reason my faces I think she knows what she needs to do to compromise and get a deal the question that she doesn't know whether she can get it through her cabinet or Republican\nSo Brigitte ... does that mean that actually what you're hearing from Europeans are over on the continent is that no deal is shaping up to be the outcome\nNo fault for I think is happening is the European Council is offering treats innate time it's asking the to negotiating teams to get back to work and if ... says at any stage in early November that there's enough\nNothing's been achieved to warrant to European Council then there will be a European Council [laughter]\nSo I think this is back to the tape but it's a question of how far can be done and to quote sold ... agreed that will enable treats them a sign up to us but I think it's also important for me to say as\nI heard Neal Richmond there is no way that any Irish Government were sign up to a withdrawal agreement that does not include a legally binding backstop with as a time limit there can be no time limits I think that's written in it that's written in ...\nWhen exactly and what about what about a ... point that that is something that may not be possible for three of them made it to get through not only the parliament in Britain but her own party in ...\nWell then that's unfortunate the opens up\nThe new deal scenario because without a withdrawal agreement there can be no orderly withdrawal\nI think both sides do not want that outcome both sides are determined to work very hard but it would be wrong with me to give the audience the u._k. audience a sense that this was ... that that was ... room on a deeply binding backstop there isn't\nBut also we must remember that this is what you pay it self ... this is not something the U.S asking crease in may in ... in March of this heat in March of this

the economy of Britain and its relations with other trading partners\nWill look as president said no one woman's no deal because everyone knows that there'll be damaged the damage was mainly in the United kingdom but it will also be two of the member states notably Arlen everyone wants to avoid this and I think left at the moment\nIs the biggest factor that means I'm Still relatively confident we will arrive at a deal simply because the alternative would be bad but there's no doubts about that Brexit is going to have\nA a a negative impacts on the British economy because the government has signed up to a program of leaving the single market and the customs union there was no way of doing that without ...\nUsing barriers to trade with the law just in closest trading thoughtless or the economic impact will be negative\nAnd I met him from the u._k. and are changing Europe thank you and there's a lot from from the road at Truman Center for advanced studies in Florence thanks for
