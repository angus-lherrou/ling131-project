now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now there are species will continue to decline\nAnd so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystems\nWhat constitutes a tipping point now as opposed to five years ago well ten years ago\n... decrees about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where\nEcologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when a species reaches a certain point in their population there is really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still enough independent populations that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus on that have good populations of lions that if we invest now we're going to prevent falling off the cliff\nAnother argument you might read the report is saying there's a case for investing development funding in protecting parks now if I'm In charge of advocates in lots of money for the vitamin on thinking first of all hell for roads and schools not better funding for a park so how'd you make that case\nThat is because a lot of people don't associate conservation with benefits to people and so they tend to invest in human focus development like infrastructure\nLike education but really investment in parks with wildlife is investment in people because of the benefits to ecosystems and human health but also tourism so it's important to realize that the wildlife watching industry\nThat's her in Africa generate an estimated thirty four billion dollars

actually there's no eye witness account of what she looks like what we have is let me see images of including sculptures and coins and if we look at those it would appear that she wasn't each for

difficult we can see from the surviving documents that Egypt had the most elaborate astonishing bureaucracy to control the production of food to control unto false to trade with countries outside Egypt\nAnd ... and he seems to have been overseeing and participating in the control of those kinds of issues one of the way she often did this it seems is through her relationship to the Egyptian

D our TV which is even worse\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatment success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any\nAny comparison to even usual tuberculosis and even though there were at will be called adverse events or some lab abnormalities almost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped\nWith this study does is to stay to the importance of the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... and the multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world where\nAn estimated almost five hundred and fifty eight thousand people with empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated so when we use this new drug but ...\nAnd this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key so what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago\nAnd the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd we need new tools butler new tools like a new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis in the world\nAnd for that and of course the availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess is extremely important in the fact that it was done in a country like the liver is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world are fact that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine\nOr so called program conditions I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis and this way and this is this is ... ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough but remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistant and\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis is something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy so what happens when programs don't work will you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis is empty\nArch you'd be this ... TB and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat until we came up with uh the regiments containing ... for example ... treatment was\nUp to ... uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we called an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful inject shows\nUp for many many days of the treatment it means that we can cut the treatment down to shorten as nine months that were working now and the TV community to get the regimen down to just six months for\nFor our listeners this new drug ... and it is kind of really cure TB all instances [noise]\nBut ... is one of the as I say only the one of the two new drugs that we have\nWhenever we have a new drug with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that is needed to develop new medications that we can give that we can give people\nDr Paolo if would you are there at the scientific director of the international union against tuberculosis split firewood dish of a\nSurprise to miss it us this morning after his impressive ... last night he schooled and set up two goals\nFor ... and make a balmy Angus they'd be less to three one then out to point some of the top of the table and it's ten consecutive wins full of the gun is an old competitions also coach and I am remade as captain for the night and commended him for his commitment\nIn the European champion see gay tend to be ten of Christianity now do to Manchester United in group age is one of the fixtures of the night that was pre made a day ago still could become the fence and golden cup treats the funding all the African champions league\nThey take one lead into the second leg of the semi final away to SPA runs into news yeah Egypt I asked the aren't on ... of Algerian leading to nail\nIn basketball the brawn James is still waiting for his fest at the end a lake and softer they fail to one hundred and forty three points to one hundred and forty to defeat to San Antonio ... says that's not three defeats from three at the start of this record a season and that's what the school\n... many thanks we say it in unison [laughter]\nNow China is officially opened the ... bridge in the world it's fifty five could almost alone and links uh Hong Kong Macau to the Chinese mainland is on our business is a it's going to make\n...

World Series almost goodbye for me and James Julian Marshall joins us in the city to tell us what's coming up on world update great to see it first of all\nThank you very much good morning within the next hour of course we're expecting the Texas president or a ... describing is the naked truth about the killing of the Saudi journalist a ...

the black sea it's more than\nTwo hundred thousand four hundred years old and it's incredibly well preserved\nOr we're going to be speaking to one of the marine archeologists who discovered it that's coming up we'll update and it was not for Julian main thanks [noise]\nThinking\nThat you're listening to us in the U.S as a possibility that he might have popped out to buy a mega millions lottery tickets\nTo begin with a chance of winning a record breaking one point six billion dollar check pulled but we'll see your odds of winning a little area I spoke to do to lose left in the statistician with Georgia Tech school mathematics to find out why you would have to be very very lucky\nMega millions is a ... a lottery that crosses most of the United states or is about I think maybe four states that are not included so it's really almost like a a national lottery in the U.S where people buy a ticket or two dollars and they she want\nSpecial number out of twenty five and then five other numbers out of Seventy\nAnd if they match all six numbers they'll win the jackpot is one point six billion\nAssuming no one else chooses the same number and the winters will get their share after taxes or a\nYeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent me a lot\nOf me when I look at the spread of artist you've worked twist that they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and ...\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for me people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to use women in the videos from a place of strength\nOr a public place so strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that little bit more because one of the most effective ways of promoting music is vi as six you know when the video and naked album conflict or some ways to selling a product\nBut give me ... posts nitty drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nOh look it depends on what I'm inspired by\n... with the idea of the feminine body\nAnd sex of course but it's fun to different places from it takes place is from a place of sensuality there's a subtle section is a woman holds when she is powerful in her own sensuality I Do explored but is it tasteful yes I think a lot of the\nQuote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if that's what inspired by that is what inspired my mom you might be gratuitous in some places\nI'm never going to a judge when I Am\nPutting a concept together the few things I'm looking at does promote the art is what are you trying to say I never think in a way where I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd just hire someone throat dollars that are out if I'm going to do that you have to be for appeal at the end of that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club you went to a gentleman\nAnd the woman dancing but I think in the hands of a different direct to that video because I didn't really see any absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nThat is actually the most raunchy video I've ever done when he came out it was it was a big deal because prior to that with kick it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but old Justin Bieber clean cut and that video was one of the things that broke him into that sex symbol kind of thinking\nAnd I know he's had a little bit nervous about it it was turning Twenty one I seen at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women ... says but it is not like you said it every once in the hands of maybe somebody else\nIt will not have been tastefully done if you saw from the costumes that they were wearing ... they had the mosques on doing something very ...\nCentral about the ... they have the power and he was the one actually I was overwhelmed\nThe one than anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is and you probably want to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now after that you know\nIf there was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of\nThose famous video is out of the American sing a Katy Perry you know the song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production zero was on the video for ... and by then we can sing or how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is all for two very very different artists inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with or not is no doubt you're putting your own personal standpoint that project is no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with what can we think tuition and you'll making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of king about his flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that pass them stop or to take\nAn artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more willing to let you\nDo want to put your personal ... that's what I noticed that does want to do so you can recognize easy that is the\nKing of the product you know and and and it's it's funny because I was a real fashion about five years ago ... well they start to start putting names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was not really\nThe best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about it's not ... and ... but it's meant for the artist if anything suit\nCan get what you say that the common theme is about how women one to come across these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the track and me Steve how you interpret it because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have to\nFall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know I have to have something to say that they want to show in the video and then I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me through how you go from page to find will put up like what are your techniques\nSo you know they gave me the fall\nI go back I can listen to a song and meeting yet he snatch is a picture in my head like I just like still frames and I just have to read those things together and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to you know please don't when I'm washing my team that a plane when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing that I'm trying to the way from is\nThinking about the idea is never watch for me\nI don't think about the idea initially ... come to me in ways and you know when I'm speaking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I just get up and I write it all down because I'm not going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I found it to them and a hundred percent of the hundred\nThe article I Love that idea [laughter]\nA hundred percent I I don't know I didn't believe I Do have to say that's that's what it is I was very choosy about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point to the level of trust that has come in in in my career boosts of\nPrecedents of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'm equate deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last quick question was who were not pension or something and I do you have very passionate about it I can see I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look the dress you know whether the ... the entire\nVision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know for me maybe you can get 'em\nTalks about the ... of the songs\nAnd over again she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine [laughter] what about you how do you come to to get that decision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that are definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh [laughter]\nAh [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you know it's ... you know I only saw the gas yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with ... you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a track and I\nLike to make it as a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular over the director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get artists that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors [noise]\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many hours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a Beyonce and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky just be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just had to come up with an idea and my heart for the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but not support a band director that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success show [laughter]\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artists and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the ... project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I mean yeah I had the opportunity to working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not genes look beyond say\nYou're listening to the conversation I guess all to award winning music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you both operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think can be a specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating to send ... holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points way somebody went to something a little bit differently so just in does has yeah\nIt's a database that exist on line basically he just needs to be female to be a part of it so in case somebody looking for a female director they can just sort of go on the website and have a look and see who's out there that basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually play\nTo have females in every single pitching protests of a commercial for gas ... know Kenny how who for OU that soon you wouldn't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director it's already happening\nWhen I first came into the industry I mean you had female directors but the wind you need to do if you think it's a problem globally even was in Africa and especially in Nigeria picking up or something I said earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos\nActually do that and one of the reasons I Do that is because it's imperative for me at the little gold watching the TV can see that and he looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls do people like king us seeing people like me\nBut I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry\nNot just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men want to have interviews I very very conscious of the worst that I use a lot of times when you when we do have enemies in my gym at what they\nTend to say is oh so what does it feel like being in the middle industry plus correction is it's not a real industry the male dominated industry they're trying to change that I wrote that tell you how I had been able to come into the industry things up hot to drugs remain\nI Need to use positive what if I go oh was me it's so hot and da da da da da\nAnd then you might get into the hands of the little girl watching she's going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep back and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to see me and see that I Am actually competing in this industry that I'm going to lend to ship something that's big for me is every once in a while and then she will go on Instagram go anywhere just pull out women\nGo come over here you can be on this project and then dumped just being around understanding that it can be done senior woman in the position of power embolden them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own direct to doing their own little projects I\nSaid last question is your dream artists which is what you'd like to work with\nKenny I Would say beyond said 'cause she will challenge\n[laughter] like I can imagine you cannot sorry we can go there and a half\nAgainst each other for that one [laughter]\nHaving my hair and the other time you pay [laughter]\nBeyond say it is then thank you both can me and ... it's been a pleasure speaking to you in the conversation today thank you thank you I've been talking to the wood winning music director ... ... from Nigeria and can get this from the straight here thinks listening I'm ... would that he can speak to them [noise]

stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they ... they are defective automatic parted\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the automatic way of moving and walking which

and getting from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to going to get the milk when I go to take it with any it's Osage they'll say she's still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do the things is that if all nice impossible\n[noise]\nSounds like in these issues than have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of the freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still occasions why episodes suddenly come on without warning\nThe n._r._a. was formed way back in Eighteen Seventy one by to civil war veterans who during the civil war saw first hand that the typical American young adult male didn't no one end up a gun from the other\nAnd so they formed the n._r._a. to improve the shooting a marksman chip skills of militia eligible men and they did shooting tournaments sporting competitions things like that and it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties\nThat it began to turn ... attention more to politics Congress passed the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd in the Nineteen seventies there was a measure in Congress to severely restrict access to hand guns gun rights people within the n._r._a. felt that they were being attacked in besieged by the rest of the country so that group took control and ever since then\nThey become much more political much more focused even obsessed with what they call gun rights and it's produced the organization that we know today\nCity in our age is kind of rabble rousing group that is ... is the right to the Americans to bear arms it is not a gun lobby group and yet it does have a presumably an intimate relationship with the gun making industry\nWell the ... does have a long connection to the gun industry and had behaved as the sort of political mouthpiece because they have one overriding common interest to press as many guns into as many hands as possible\nThat have been a number of school shootings of course in the United states we think of Columbine Sandy Hook and others most recently that's been the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Florida which\nDoes seem more than other events to galvanize movement against the gun lobby how much of a threat has that been to the the NRA\nThe high school students who attended the Parkland high school in Florida\nThey did something that victims have never done before instead of seeking privacy and avoiding the media they went in front of national cameras and said look we're sick of this our leaders have failed us\nWe're tired of them being afraid of the gun lobby and they have aggressively pushed this issue\nThroughout the spring summer and now into the fall of this election year and by doing that they're trying to keep the issue as a top tier concern so that after the elections there may be greater momentum to perhaps enact some stronger gun laws [noise]\nIn my head it was a terrible tragedy\nThe money is even [noise]\nLower the shooting them and Douglas students like ... Gonzales here have directed that political file on the n._r._a. federal advocate ...\nDescribes as uprising Lee affected the students efforts to galvanize political opinion and an emerging boycott campaign around the n._r._a. have been\nVictims and survivors of these of the shooting were high school students who knew very smartly how to use social media and how to kind of\nLeverage their pain and their fear into politics very quickly and there were a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to NRA members lot of them are household names you had a rental car company\nI'm sure people use all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all of those companies for trans parents say the public deserves to now which companies are supporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting\nVery quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly\nHold their relationships with the IRA which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of firearms for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the ... finances we know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails\nBut I think one interesting facts that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty eight ten mid term elections they are spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the interest rate was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twin the fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the end All right for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal miss a pool for the n._r._a. but we did reach one candidate base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David lab the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment co op\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the prior to the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and trust that had some fifty thousand signatures on it\nWe weren't really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evidence that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what you're seeing and what we were following primarily in our social media channels [noise]\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and rainy trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long Kenyan vendors off our shoes ethics were posted two hours then that's the holding company\nSo they were very round people um [laughter] I was on the line to us than would've been impacted by our decisions\nRight so we've been essentially a with the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your show products made by this vista outdoor ... which was you would not selling firearms or ammunition yourself\nMr out during does manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nBut they got it up for sale I don't think it's been sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but oversee we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves caught up in this boycott of\nOf the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who\nBreached take pause does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I say that we know that that's the ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S in his final politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the ... campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway the key\nThing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money so much as it has been the cell is loyalty of its base\nGun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend a meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities in the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the enterprise fine and swimming alone despite its claims of ...\nWell ... does have money problems\nThey spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle that gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump that contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reported on in the American media in recent months\nAnd their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male\nAnd that generation is frankly dying off back in the Nineteen sixties one household into had at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nLady ... nicknamed the Iron Lady was British prime minister and a key ally of right wing leaders around the world\nAnd lots of joy
