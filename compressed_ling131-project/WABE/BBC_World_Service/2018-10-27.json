World Service [noise]\nEighteen minutes past the hour Francis Fukuyama made his name in Nineteen eighty nine with or provoke the title essay the end of history question mark at\nThe time western liberal democracy seemed to be winning out sober communism and author of terrorism in the essay argued that liberal democracy will be mankind final form of government to do stick by the way mostly tobacco idea his latest book\nTakes on the rise of populism it's cold identity contemporary identity politics and the struggle for recognition\nHe says liberal democracy has been having a tough time since its peak in the early to thousands\nI liked democracy I think it's good for the world and I think it's good for the people that live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats democracy\nWell very many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and I think that he's pointing that corner\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting\nBut the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances to make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nWell hang on democracy is only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but\nTheir choices cannot uh include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' they're equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWere linked to see between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity but it's not being adequately recognized and that's where we go into politics\nBecause we want political recognition that a dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years you recently got a voice now from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't do yes I did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect it's something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know when I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this was really an option for me\nNow there will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like the old dining hungry who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives that Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a Californian view you know what a liberal Californian view your day night has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people uh you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say are you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in ... in in the U.S vote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans\nSurely that's democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI hits I'm\nThe Justice Department and I think that if she gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts and the independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand that dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nYes it's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk ... democracy and I think it's in some ways ... democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes platelets got in the middle\nAnd it doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that worked together and work against each other and the same in the same set a sentence [laughter]\n[noise] yeah and in fact this is one of the programs that we are back in because there are a lot of rumors going around about the ... on what the health workers\nAre doing to fight against it so one of the room overseas that in fact the body bags are empty our that they'd be seized half being removed civil other though for the pirates or organs for ... and ... and does the reason\nThey did that was of course what they ... they believe he was completely normal by the way that are supposed to high risk for all of them to to get their values so for instance we have a room or fucking system\nTo be updated from ... to know what other rumors that are really you'll find they seem they will but he's trying to control of their own values and two decades this are rumors directly through your friend that protests that were getting through with even a social media said that um\nI guess it's difficult to build up trust between health workers and the local community in in a very short time in the way that things need to be done ... me\n[noise] it's actually it's quite this equal and that's why the red cross abilities worldwide through volunteers who debuted on to\nTheir communities but despite of that's it's a very difficult because as I said we are to come from pain new approach of doing things like for instance the cessation dignified barrios ... opposed to what they are used to do a ... will say\nAnd it seems to be the case that amendment more children are becoming infected than adults do you know why that is\n[noise] what can be yeah so that I read some saying right now the rainy season is just starting with ... ... in the number of my uh cases on the scene thumbs on science off maybe I can be confused with the ones from man of the border\nSo that he supports the ... the ... and I have not sought to health I bought I bought in my area so that means that for a few days the children are receiving a treatment that these are not what they should be receiving\nAnd finally WHM has said that they are concerned about the situation how worried to you about the containment if this outbreak do you think it will sprint\nWhere I'm from the nightly the virus doesn't know about ... or ... there's\nSo we really need to take care of that because there are a number of unknown cases or cases that are coming from a known sources so in that regard the ministry of health W. H. O. they are doing a\nIn ... but this is going to turn in let's say maybe for neighboring countries where there you're not to do the borders and where they buy groceries or more difficult to go and things\nDo up to ... and we'll keep you across the situation here on health check\nNow Claire a couple of weeks ago we were talking about life expectancy is and how long people might live two in the future and ... but now it's a study looking way beyond that so how long humans might live in the distant future\nAnd that's just vexed question of whether there is a natural limits to the human lifespan which we can never go beyond regardless of what medical advances made now this is a debate it's been going on ...\nOh yes because everybody's aware that life expectancy has been increasing for quite a long time and that's always been this question I vote when it's going to stop and many people have thought well it's got to stop at some point and it's got to be some natural limit to what the human body is capable of\nSo the latest study has a ... from quite surprising angle they looked at ... uh when we die and they look if you plot the age at which people are likely to die on a ...\nYou can see this time any one particular point in time or it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and I ... back down on the other side in a nice symmetrical cut of\nI'm not a beautiful ballad because has been shifting ... uh in people's lives of the century has broken progressed\nSo um it's just been the kind of still looks the same now if there was some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs would start to get compressed and which are much more cramped up but it's not doing that\nSo you think I thought so cluster often that you have I don't know loads and loads and loads of people dying eighty five Ninety exact not what's happening\nExactly and it's not doing that so I'm of course he doesn't tell us that are done and I can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that the cub Will Stone altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yeah\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on all buddy for instance maybe I'll just a destined to crumble after such an age or\nMaybe the race it which uh we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I just I thought was quite theoretical and there's no sign of that happening yet\nThanks class now that I was saying when we discuss life expectancy a couple of weeks ago it was Spain that came out on top with the U.S slowdown in less than you might expect a lot of the reasons for this was because every day in the U.S an average of a hundred and Fifteen people die from an opioid overdose\nThe people come from all walks of life but in San Francisco a team of public health workers it's focused on treating the most vulnerable populations homeless people on the city's streets\nNow is that a couple of weeks ago on the size of the homeless population is very visible next month voters will decide whether the city's biggest businesses many of them tech companies have

unequivocal works with Sarah on the streets team\nWe go to them and we just say hey how's it going to try to build a relationship first and check in with folks I think\nThat's the reason why a program is so successful because I think everybody that works here these people first and then patients check in and ask what they need and try to deliver that not impose my own agenda known them\nThe clinic

and water and medical history\nNo like who are you how can we help you ...\nDescribes the process as motivational interviewing which involves a lot of listening and no judgment\nSo like if somebody comes in and they were like hey Anna I've been using a lot I'm not going to say oh you shouldn't do that would be like oh well what are your thoughts around that what's happened with that and then just kind of carry that conversation like that\nDon't know but let's say that if before they couldn't actually remember at least of Maine's after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit\nImprovement but the main improvement for me it's about ... out to be Gadhafi go memory\nSo once they start to do ever met their memory and about the best for months through the memory do start to do that a lot of their own stories\nWhich is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least reaching that point in which you can remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo would you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these ... many many different situation because it's a strong draining it's a really good training and it's so it's really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and everybody will most everybody we have a book in our house and someone who reads will you\nDo up to ... ... this was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this was enough to slow down the process of dementia or is it but it's it's really interesting\nIt was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because I'm with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just from the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading to them and in fact she's already recommended by nice the official ah UK and they check guidelines buddy\nUh that's one thing you can do with people with dementia is just try and get\nThem more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and trying to stimulate them a intellectually in any way you can\nAnd this reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other studies have been done on with people with a bunch of things like singing all reminiscent therapy yes\nReminiscent therapy it sounds almost similar because in a way I'm getting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from that used and you you might use products like photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get him to talk about some of that very old memories and we do know the same people with dementia often issues so very oldest memories to tell them mixed intact\nSo I guess with the lack of effective medication anything that might help people's members if they've got to venture is going to be a good idea yes\nIt's understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot of dementia I mean they're all so much that people can be given they tend to just um ease ... hops don't want for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to set and not right for everybody so and this
