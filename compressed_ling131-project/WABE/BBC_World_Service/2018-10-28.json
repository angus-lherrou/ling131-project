program today the plastics drill a little bit wider than that but it's an example of something that could be consigned to history and European Union countries soon on Wednesday the European Parliament voted in favor of a ban on single use plastic products\nThat would apply to such items is draws plates ... which make up more than Seventy percent of waste material in the world's oceans other plastic such as drink bottles will have to be collected separately and recycled at a race of Ninety percent by twenty twenty five on to you know\nSpeaking during the debate before the vote the Irish any Pete look main look men Flanagan described encountering his first plastic capturing the Nineteen seventies and he said nobody thought then that it will prove to be such a threat to the environment\nAt the

dangerous and I said that now even with who we have in the White House\nBy twenty fifty there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish by weighs a hundred and ... different marine species known twice ingested drastic\nCould have been like this work elsewhere in the world specifically could work in the U.S Peter Morici is an American economist in business professor at the University of Maryland I asked him if he welcomed the legislation from the European Parliament\nI'm a little puzzled as to what the objective is if it's to reduce carbon that's fine but you have to consider that a sweeping ban\nMay cause producers are manufacturers to come up with solutions that are even more harmful to the environment\nLet's think airplanes there's a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nAlso and takes resources to make that metal just like a plastic and takes energy and it's heavier as a consequence that may cause the airplane thing get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around a metal a knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one that doing the wrong thing or they\nOh I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right across the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhile it's not out ... is it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throwing in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that there was single use plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as he wanted to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many a return of a bottles in the United states in about twenty five years while there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not the single use plastics should be used\nIt's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternative to sweep thing is I mean if if you introduce legislation to ban single use plastics if\nYou don't have the ... doesn't did a good thing or is it not in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban should such measures they expend that so that it becomes written into global trade deals that\nI was in New Hampshire it's been a European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right what's really light and you'll plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things\nThis nature however one wants has to be judicious about this and think it hurt you have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less independence on the energy use of the alternative\nThat's the problem right then you decide to just you know blindly regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man day at a possible that as far as people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic Hawkins is the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic fault surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk makers\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single used plastic probably makes pretty good sense but getting rid of all\nI don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation 'cause they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment\nBecause in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that ...\nWell [laughter] I understand what he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternatives but I Do think that environments degradation on climate change that we're seeing in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need\nSweeping I'm an action scale on this and of course looking at plastic is not new\nAnd we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco and of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags and\nI think it's a very welcomed development my slights um reservation is around the bottom plastic strollers in particular and I've been reading the concessions from disability rights ... campaign is about this and who took about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws\nUm in order to be able to drink liquids and\nHow to use metal ones or pay well I well actually other materials such as paper on mental a glass of silicon don't necessarily what so many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury\nAnd that can be a choking hazards metal for example is not safe\nFor hot liquids and paid petted soldiers with repeat the juice and so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ... plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development\nAnd I also like to look not just that single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic in in the oceans that's due to ... I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is\nFrom that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew I Know this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is won't stop boils down to the Peter Morici interview that people should be free to blue environment if they want [noise]\n... well ...

sounding something like this\nLike cop times get back Mike how\nDepending I suppose if it's your actual mother talking to you to explain why this might be we tend to Daniel Glazer and neuroscientist base here in the u._k.\nYour weight or asleep you'll since organs are taking in information from the world all the time she will sound or smell taste lives even with your eyes closed a monitoring the world all the time\nAnd we have very sophisticated mechanisms from bus to direct our attention to things that are important and to filter out the things that don't and actually it's the filtering out that's more important than the direction because if we were alive to everything that was happening all the time we'd be overwhelmed and so\nThe question is why do children's succeed to ignore things in their sleep\nBetter than adults and this is clearly true for any of us who've had young children alone or others you can take them to a disco practically let's say to a wedding with the pounding music and once they're asleep they stay asleep through and\nAnd the answer is that ... that developmental stage of childhood sleep is more important than knowing what's going on\nThis ... sites

humans is that with ... unable to the cough drops elves\nAnd in that time with that early stage of development the first two years sleep is incredibly important\nBecause it's in sleep that we replay the experiences of the day strengths and the connections that we've developed and lose the ones that simple so the tradeoffs that we make as humans is to\nBuild children that basically ignore everything when they're sleeping because sleep is more important than working out what's going on and that's because we're born\nDependent on our parents took off his\nEssence can fend for themselves pretty much from the humans comes now the question of why your mother's voice is more important than than the other is an interesting story also that humans from before the with tuning in\nTo sounds that message to us and so the first few months of life we're exquisitely sensitive\nTo the whole range of environmental sounds that way\nAnd count the kinds of music that we hear the kinds of language that we hear\nA very very young ages changes that perception for the whole of our lives and so babies tune into them up as voices\nFrom the very young age and be on the initial period is the sound that his most salient says most relevant to them so it's not surprising that this ... results is a small sample a study that's just been reported find stops a mother's voice is much more salient much more relevant\nSensitive to other people far more able to listen to other people\nUm I I I'd say far more able to offer support 'em because if you've been for something like that you'll you'll often in a much better position um to advise others and support them um there is there's so many people out there and no doubt some people that were listening as we're speaking now it it does get better and you'll perspective only\nThose change so just keep the faith and keep going ... you are in Lagos this weekend because it's been decided by organizers of a festival that that it's going to be a place

and previously it's being held in ... and about two hours outside like us that this is the ... being held to make us and it's always really wonderful to have\nArtists writers poets from across the continent gather 'em to talk about issues affecting the continent and also talk about that what\nI'm and I'm In sea and took about a book that I co edited a which is published earlier this year together with Michael additives does he know Mohammed and ... and we had a panel on friday talking about quitting is I'm In Nigeria\nEven was created us as he put it in Nigeria homosexuality is illegal isn't it\nAnd say yes sets in citizen sexual acts are legal and as well as the registration an appreciation of gay clubs and societies on same sex marriage and but this is why it was so wonderful to be able to talk about the book in Niger in front of such a supportive and won't origins\nAnd I've been going to the festival ... fourteen and it's great to see how the festival has changed in this regard so I remember the festival at the once he was in twenty four team from that you had\nAnd people making intensely homophobic statements to audience applause and then you had a number of years led the organizers quite consciously I think\nHad the panels on Quinn is interviews with trans women working with algae beauty organizations like the initiative for equal rights and and here the atmosphere was still a bit combative with lots of questions and questioning from the audience\nIs there a little against promoting homosexuality is the government of some governments posted in Nigeria in which case you might've fallen foul of that just discussing the issue\nWell and then the little actually talks about promotion and operation of gay clubs in societies and I would say that\n... says he has he puts it and any such legislation against that would actually infringe freedom of expression which is guaranteed by the nature and constitution and but in the end by his panel was the room was just filled with positivity and warmth\nAnd I've been really moved by the number of people who've come up to me and my ...\nAnd that really excited about the book\nAnd and really wanting to start having these conversations in ninth Jan\nAnd I think we also need to see that and the contacts of changes in the cultural space in general so we've had a number of books come out like oh let me say purple as when we speak of nothing ... says under the dollar cheese Ayesha who not as a hundred miles of sound like a which at both brilliant but\nBut ... says as well as lots

these crises that have been response by personality clashes to a certain extent have really irritated versus across Germany that's sick of seeing politicians in button squabbling amongst themselves say what we could see today\nIs versus in ... in this region punishing the two main governing policies up in Berlin which has nothing to do raise the reach of with the region but this means that it

I Know you've talked about alternatives for Germany 'til you're blue in the face we do every time we mentioned Germany in a political context how about the greens\nWell that's right so we have on the one hand the right wing populists ... Germany on the other hand to the left of the spectrum you've got the greens both parties are doing pretty well the greens doing really well\nI'm not because we've had a long hot summer in Germany that's played into lots of green concerns about climate change also the green policy has really credible leadership right now so the the the thing is very nice it\n... this is already ... to pitch\nNational pitcher in Germany at the big main big tens policies during less well\nBecause the scientists changed under votes is really look at individual issues rather than long loyalties to a left wing or right wing policies have ... votes have become quite fickle and that's why these these two policies are both extremes the spectrum of doing pretty well\nBut what we're all ... thing really is the ... there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the with the main policies I'm not connected to migration because the two big sense left center right parties are quite divided on migration\nThe greens are very clear the very pro open borders as they report says the ... the generals are very clear that essentially a gates migration so when it comes to migration votes has no will those two policies think about\nAnd then not migration issue also is representative of the whole world view ready so the issue of migration hasn't actually been mentioned much in the ... elections in the campaign over the last few weeks\nBut that does play into an idea ... how they see themselves ... votes to see themselves as how they would describe as open minded or\nInternational tolerance or however you want to say they were very green if he says that they can sell those traditional they they're nervous about change\nThey might very tasty so he's not really just about migration as a whole world view I'm not wells view is something that the ask the on the greens talk very well on the both parties are pretty nice it all those sorts of\nCourse in motion the quite subtle issues\nDamien McGinnis simple in many things we're going to go to minute for quick point teach Matthew and Chitra on on your view from where you are on these German elections which sound quite important Chitra well\nFor me just listening to your costs London that it strikes me how similar dynamics on not just in Gemini by now the ... the intense about this move away from the center they from the mainstream\nThat benefits those progressive parties like the queen's as well as the ... right on the ... and also that this is happening in the context of\nEconomic closed and lo and employment I find quite striking Islam\nMatthew I thought the point Damien made about the Green Party advancing on the fact that in Germany people are actually connecting the hot summer to climate change that sounds like they're well ahead of us in the u._k. where\nAll the debate is so dominated by Brexit that I mean politics is always being more central in job yeah this will be a new door and even for that green ... well it was quite an ... such a huge economy in such a big global ... that we can maybe see a little sliver of hope that\nYou're listening to the b._b._c.
