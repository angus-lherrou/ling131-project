G inside the Saudi consulate\nDefeat chilies almost complete the as soon as he enters the coast so they know the short time he has been kicked\nI think those explanations that's made by Saudi Government that was it for the fees to fight or something like this impossible of course is on convincing clay because Fifteen guys it warmed by the way I see Mexico she fights\nYou has been lynched I think they came in ... to ... and ... his body and they are not that much because I was talking about some deep pays\nFor example the just waiting for him outside and if something is wrong track them showed him for me or somebody has\nTech he promised to reveal every detail about the killing of your mouth shut gee\nDoes it mean by that is it going to make the audio and video evidence of his killing which is said to exist as he can make that more generally available make it available perhaps to foreign governments\nI think turkey has many many of them because the prosecutor or the intelligence or the security forces are from the beginning collecting old evidence is old news is old data and all that are on the road ration\nAnd they are being studied and they are being analyzed out of these on the rise that will come of where the where the the paved pictures\nAbout what happened nothing will be kept a secret\nSo turkey is determined to continue challenging the Saudi version of the death of Jamal ... your determined to do that even though there might be diplomatic consequences for turkey\nFor the diplomatic additions doesn't contain to hide the crimes that in a criminal issue here and this cannot be kept secret that cannot be hiding in the sense of justice should not be in those\nCould I just don't drop that because all you tending towards now accusing the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man of all during the mud or robbed Jamal ...\nActually a ... a closing nobody you cannot because anybody because Steve the investigation results officially the hasn't been compete with yet\nThat was ... chief advisor to the Turkish president Richard type or the one and a close friend of ... just on that last point rose among the close friend to the ... degree I Wonder whether the personal side of this story has been lost as people have rushed to talk about the geopolitics\nUh yes I suspect that that is true and one of the thing that I Am raising less bad mouth shut and he was putting up with in the run up to his death he was receiving\nA crazy amount as a piece on line this friends that she talked about that some as well um and you know he's way camp every morning to ... and stuff and it was really really weighing on him as as you might imagine it would be very nation and training\nAnd say well let's see he knew he was in um uh you know in in in ...\nI'm about to say something to kind of going from being of actual threats of to being a real threat is very different thing but I think we have we have forgotten ... say as well and the less I mean I I kept thinking that I've been watching it was a horrific\nThing to be way sang\nAnd you know and she's had all this time of wasting for announcer what's happened to him as well and I mean that must be just an extraordinary human pain has um and of course it is it does show one of the dangers of being at ... at the extreme end of this ... of being a generalist center\nI'm writing about a country that doesn't believe in the rights of people to write freely and criticize ...\n... I was also struck daddy about what do you see that type given that he's the chief advisor to the Turkish president was to ... to ... still might do and say and reveal in the coming days you know what I mean the sort of\nHow it's being leaked is um you know is is graphic it's atrocious and to think that the\nState's condones or a initiates um this level of um of atrocities just I'm I'm I'm thinking of all and nothing to to ... earlier point to not say because we work with dissidents and activists and journalists all around the world\nAnd that is true that many of the of their friends and family are just as much on the threat I'm as the activists themselves in fact there are several examples just in recent years where we are partners has managed have had to take\nFamily and children out of a country because of the vulnerability that they suffer inside behind tragedies like this lie a whole set of other relationships that are vulnerable and an ...\nAn during but what you were saying about the digital world I mean clearly that is one of the roots that people are using to put some of this stuff out\nThat absolutely not only do we know much more are we able to know much more about where the whereabouts and the relationships that anyone that we want to attack um but of course that um the very tools that we can use to intimidate and to silence them ... are are um yeah\nWhich is a difficult balance them into strikes me\nAs well I I mean I think can well what we're trying to find out in this case electric ... is that Twitter is why he was receiving that does have questions to answer on that as soon as they think that as a troll farm in Riyadh and sending oldest it'd be nice to any critics at the ... regime\nI mean there is free movement is in between New Zealand Australia\nWill that it that it's precisely that pressure economic relations agreement that allows for eight minutes to\nThat has created in in a way the problem because if an asylum seeker ... a refugee they settled in another country they would ... some ... and I noticed come back to Australia which would be a mechanism ... at one way not safe for blocking their return if that's what the government wants to do\nThat with New Zealand there is a writes\nA of all new state and does to uh to to free movement into Australia said that his ... and ... the reason why this ban is seen as important because they strengthen government does not want anybody who's being removed from nine to ... have to have the opportunity to settle it straight it it's gotten the policy from the very\nTitle so ... what does that therefore mean the New Zealand government would have to do in order to make this work\n[noise] yeah well this was of course there's also was ... years ago and and the fish are are are they in all sorry um and at that point a strike was asking that New Zealand and full of less than hot so low that that um would eventually create\nUm and there was opposition to it from the Green Party which was my times evening as well\nIt would create the kind of state can tear\nResidency or citizenship within Zealand um\nWhich was really kind of singing and now it's slipped site that of course that's sort of going to the terrible Lauren Australia potentially um but I but of course there is this a issue and I I have been really close contact with the ... since the software was nice to understand\n... ... what was happening I visit but um you know it's the broad base um\nApproach that this particular little types which doesn't just affect the uh you know at the end type that that New Zealand world have but actually you know it kind of unpaid the rights of a ... asylum sake or or or a refugee that's come through that kind of the arrival pass 'em\nBecause the ... of course for some reason has decided to differentiate between classes of [laughter] of modern state because uh depending on how they arrive what it is I Do understand the opposition but but at at at least doesn't affect us and New Zealand sorry the stands want them\nYou know I was gonna say 'cause I just wanted to clarify that before I bring down the road Rosa ... on the broad issue the New Zealand off of that you referred to that goes back some time in the past you think that's a good idea that that is a positive from New Zealand point of view\nYes they do you also was night by a previous a prime minister or John K and it was renewed immediately by a out prime minister ... when she took office\nSo that that offer 'em one that stands on and of course the practicalities of become complex F F it as accepted um because of course there the children and it's Ninety or children I'm at at last count that I had access to and of course I've got family so it made\nIt there there's a lot more people than one fifth of all of that to take a couch all this while\nI'm right so it was from a studio here then I'll come back to you both ... and your mind well look\nI Know that the you know over the last few decades or being points at which this tension in this free movement agreement on remember you know straight him complaining about using them to come in living on the old and\nRobert ... Ben from New Zealand prime minister famously once went off to you know what are you worried about ... New Zealand is leaving to go to rallies had ... well no because he you know every time and he's the leaves to go to Australia\nThe IQ of bugs countries goes up\nAnd despite all of that tension never was this principle of free movement um ever really under serious threat and yet yet here is an example of how\nTo work something desperate politicians become when it comes to immigration and asylum in a few hundred people and the future I'm a ... he's putting a steak or a fundamental principle of free moving between these two combat than\nYou speak to somebody who grew up in Australia as a refugee\nAnd this is one of the things I wanted off doing about you know I my parents um found in Australia are safe home and I grew up in in a period in which started was a very welcoming nation and wandered off duty and where where is public sentiment these days in terms of of these issues\nWell well it's it's an interesting question the end and particularly interesting time at which dry skits because ah last night Australian time that we saw in ... I Believe an unprecedented um shift in political uh support from the government\nA swing of around twenty percent to in this case and independence but\nIn the context of that ...\nThat was the suggestion put out that the Australian government might finally except they a generous offer by museum which has been on the table for some some years and indeed one irony is that had a straight a accepted that off when it was just made we would have cleared out all the families and children on the road\nOr they are still about twelve hundred people on those two the two islands [noise] um\nSo I talk to your question they to the extent that the by the action is an indication and I think it is up to a point there is now a a a real public interest in resolving this problem that awhile Oculus play ah the the public could accept that\nPeople will be sent to Madison ... full of processing with a view to finding some for mature Sacramento within a year or two that full five six years later\nA way ready saying people in in desperate circumstances as you said with many suicides in threatens threats of suicides but also a crisis in mental illness so I think that there is a shift\nA that we have to be very careful in in in ... and taking the weight with 'em by the end result as too strong an indication of his shift because it was very\nIn the context of a desperate government trying to to win over relatively liberal minded like\nAdults are labor not necessarily going to do anything different\nYou know well that is that he does need to be understood that labor introduced a mad at tri ... detention that unique provision globally and has since insisted on both know robot one and down the road a rib eye too so we have to be very careful I think that the Labour Party will be more\nHumane and they probably will try to get the children off the island with their parents but nothing is sitting in this highly volatile political garbage in Australia Rosemont can I ask\nAbout the feeling in New Zealand Nass chi chi refugees and migrants because I mean obviously\nIn Europe unfortunately we have suffered this sisters increase of anti refugee and an anti immigrant rhetoric which is now she'd like in New Zealand to these people and there's always a small number of people\n[laughter] yeah and you seem to um sort of often identifies itself in opposition to Australia [laughter]\nAs you know we have sort of a Canada us relationships is I'm so serious suddenly the ... you know the war on terror ah and um and that kind of populist a movement that we've seen with the rise of Brits that and Trump\nHave differently tend to trace it here and you can kind of see that\nI'm On online forums and and and and the rise of a certain type of populist politics here um that depend on on rice and and sort of on a scapegoating of migrants so things like having a housing crisis for example in ...\nCertainly has ... and it's sad to say but in tens of that kind of fear um that kind of intense fear and and and um panic that we see an Australian sometimes this is certainly for example not an election usher and New Zealand if\nUm and we did just double that refugee course huh I'm with\nBasic you know it's a celebration malls level of [laughter] you know great celebration in some courses of course but um but without much that I'm noticing tie kind of it um\nAnd and you might think the with doubling\nWhile I was about ... what sort of figured we told you about just to get people to do\n[laughter] so yeah so I we went from seven hundred and fifty which had been affected since Nineteen Ninety four I'm up to Fifteen hundred um which still means that New Zealand ... taek is lower than a ... per capita\nSo as much as we pat ourselves on the back we're actually not doing very well in terms of on the numbers of refugees that we take him with SARS so remote that we don't really have asylum seekers arrive we have very large numbers\nUm and we in fact we have passengers screening systems and places like Malaysia and Indonesia so that people that are at risk so to speak of becoming a sign of ... or I refugees count bought pines it's much easier and more practical to do that because we don't really have the arrival\nOf just as a final brief would Julian ... what do we need to look out for in the coming weeks and months to see where this goes from here\n[noise] [noise] well as I say it's it is a particularly fall as hell moment it straight in politics [laughter] excuse me [noise] um I I don't think I get off his 'cause I think to have a frog in my ...

important enough figure I'm for it to ... but you know what's clearing the imitation is it doesn't take very long for for the you know the public investment fund to boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets on the management\nThat they have an presumably that's the game and money talks and with so many people so many countries desperate for an investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this full point two billion dollars at ... pounds of of of five billion dollars worth of annual trade ... at\nThe trade but as as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi are we prepared to give this up and roasted price rose means\nWell one of the things that we think Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate neither are the lengths that we have I without yeah I mean at somebody like that to separate families in midlife crisis naming leaving ... and ... and getting in finding says all lays out there\nAnd more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to ... come on to our safety ... any ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be if the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church has different set of values than we in the west\nOperate on what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome\nWould that change things will murder is or was gruesome regardless of how to take space um and I think uh the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this ... that's an authorized leaks so simple to to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered out he was a as a Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials\nAnd on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation bugs how does that how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course one pulled out when we knew what was happening in Yemen they rule still gathering at very happening what what what do you think about that\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not an easy subject that's operating the ritzy around with who says\nIf the straits of of um of merit in the south is Red Sea coast that's Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through those traits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through the it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news on the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west it would be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of ... complex to your political settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of false us and we're still dealing with that I think it would be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not early Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the extremist and done and you you have and then you've got the oil and um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much a day to come again not really simply as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week it's a twenty two

pace how come my buddies didn't let us do that\nWhat we have in the body is essentially two systems of energy to differently so we have aerobic metabolism which is using molecular oxygen from the atmosphere we didn't have any road metabolism which all energy transfer it proceeds not involving oxygen\nLet's say you could sprint for American the American world record with them be Seventeen minutes rather than just over a hundred and twenty minutes\nAnd the reason the body can't do that is because you channels supply die energy rapidly enough using the aerobics sister\nAerobic metabolism is quite slow whereas Arabic metabolism is extremely false you know your classic and aerobic events with a hundred meters two hundred meters four hundred meters anything above that it's the aerobic

it's just terrible so what was the main concerns that you outlined in this discussion pay from which the summit was ...\nI think one of the things we looked at ways that a lot of the technology that we eat today was never intended to meet that it was not the point of a it was just that there are a huge amount of unintended consequences that we now in the beginning to eight I\nSay for example you know how and social media is ... ... people are more interested in talking to people like that and and less engaged in the world around and and and relax connected to people who are not like and\nAnd actually there are fewer space tasteful tree public debate that exist if the full and ... and and the the unintended things that happen as a result of the aisle all we've we're beginning to ... for example in the way that people ... and and how that can be affected so\nMany huge unintended consequences or an antibody response is a pay cut some of the spies assaults tearing and threats to

T the technology and the future\nRight side partly removing fear and I guess you didn't like other outcomes as well then these restoring trust\n[noise] yeah I mean when we did a summit or one of the key drivers for putting all the event was this kind of look at this issue about a tech trust deficit a Edelman her one of our partners on the events do and I knew thing could attack to trust the ...\nAh and they found quite serious drops in the level of trust among the public around the world and things like social media platforms I'm transparency accountability for tech companies to look after\nData so there is a little bit of a trust deficit I mean it's not just tech companies it's government says NGOs or experience all kinds of jokes in trust but that\nReally is is a key in motion which is driving this kind of concerned that we have about whether it's on dates privacy mental health of our kids are the screen time that the people having the effect of democracy is this is a
