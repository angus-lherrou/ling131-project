surpluses of the early years the boom years if you like a friend of president Lula have absolutely disappeared so then it got up and living beyond its means Randy well beyond its means and with ... asset to meet\nTo well I should say the current government has made ... efforts to reform but it is a very fruit\nA weakened government I'd of very divided Congress such if I'm that you'll you'll agreeing I think in the background\nI entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history and the recovery is the slowest ever registered in the Brazilian history\nSo it's hard to imagine from outside the levels social frustration and Brazil\nEspecially when you consider that prior to that there has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so that the emergence of new so called new middle class\nIn this so called middle class has been severely hit by the recession\nNo laundered that this ... residents decide who had voted for the tea in the past is now voting massively for ...\nDays the meteor victims ... comes down to the change in global economics China perhaps demanding view of commodities and so on rather than just of economic mismanagement\n... we are witnessing in Brazil is a combination of factors we have witnessed a girl and law inclined mentioned Brazil between two thousand and three eyes to Charleston and fourteen from unfortunately all words of the criticisms a few months economic policy that\nEven people inside the degree that they are there are two measures that she ... during her second third or wrong but beyond that we had a ... year political instability and Brazil has had a direct aim by in our economy\nNot have been a tea though comes out of the corruption scandals and all that has flowed from them or doesn't have to take responsibility\nFor that and actually look to that ... the the fact that it's struggling to win votes in this election you know that daddy I just got done it\nYet with regards to that first racism against the austerity measures we agree to that\nThey were wrong but in addition to that we have to remember that right at the beginning of this second term off do must governments Congress has approved\nWhat we call about the bomb bus which our budget bills that ain't negatively in Brazil and budget and they just want to live by the president of the lower house in jail right now and also\nThrough my support from Brazil and opposition is the old politics\nAs worse it is better for us\nBecause we can't change the game and that has being damaged referred to present anymore I'm\nOn a ... that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy\nRather has a lot of great\nAnd why why Mary easy to have a budget surplus when commodity boom and the first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I Would have voted for a little bit I don't I'm hearing you asked for a long time but if I were in Brazil I Would have voted for the first\nBlack falling out that he increased wells had benefits an introduced a minimum wage\nYeah and it was the right thing to do but after the subprime crisis you start seeing a lot of counter cyclical policies that were not sustainable in the long run\nAnd by the time that a human rights or lacked\nYou see a reverse off many of the policy that the first term of Lula that ... had pursued you start seeing more much more interventionist economy and when you look at it beat the program for these election they just talking about increasing resources for areas like education health which you are very important but K ... well we\nWill talk about that in a bit ... and a bit more detail in the moment but I just want to think about the the backdrop to this election you have say president dude I Do the PC president who is embroiled in corruption finds himself in prison his successor Jill I'm a recess who was impeached\nSuggest us to lose a two factors the economy corruption the face of these two leaders that perhaps as as affected this election enormously\nBut what about the other two things that are getting on that it's all about crime and the conduct this election crime is an enormous feature present in life and Brazilian concern\nFor the for addressing this topic and I took a step back and with all due respect to ... I think clearly Diego this strategy of shifting the blame to others it's not working any longer to the ... the first one the scandal when the cyclical a corruption came was discovered\nThat the tea reacted the shift in the blame to the media to the judicial power as if they were parts of a conspiracy against the tea then when a before that Wendy economy started\nGoing down they said that they shifted the blame to the external environment so a yearly this just this rhetoric is not working any longer just looked at the polls I mean people are not buying the story and they won't\nLet me let me throw food then let's talk about how crime and we'll talk about how this election is being conducted how those affecting how Brazilians think about which way tonight\nCrime has become endemic in Brazil the reach of homicides in Brazil or has reached record levels in the last years and now we have three homicides\nFor one hundred thousand inhabitants what puts Brazil among the most violent countries in the world the nature of crime and Brazil has changed\nThere are strong organized crime linked to drug trafficking in Brazil and who are the sections of the population who are worst hit by this wave of criminality poor people read\nIt's no wonder this year it is worth noting it just a poor people who have areas the ... how we'll have more poor people have tended to vote more ...\nThat's what I mean in the whole situation you if you were right if you look at the north eastern part to Brazil when you take a huge metropolitan areas such as real\nWhich has emblematic of this endemic crime problem those poor people tend to vote to ... as a sort of knee jerk reaction to criminality based on the idea which in my view is wrong that we need extrajudicial killings for instance to do with the problem\nIs ironic how who'd and that is one of the policy that foods is national sets are the kind of crime levels that are\nSuch as just been describing no I think a lot of people are seeing now is that that wasn't always the case that that you could make this connection but there's a clear connection between corruption and and the chaos of the sea public security system in Brazil\nI'm really from real my home state is like the ground zero of corruption in Brazil\nAnd the the had the governor now former governor who is in prison and the scale of of ... mind boggling\nDig us got in a can you'll policy hoped to reassure voters that it can tackle crime effectively if it is linked to Brazil's economic second stances and indeed the levels of corruption\nYes first I think you're talking to an international August so it's very important to explain that security in Brazil is now ... by each state's and by the federal government but ...\nDon't is that is that usual to have the ... would it be welcome do you think in any country to have the minute tree ... involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon answer to that extent the sort of\nNationalist view of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the border\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society I think the more important distinction however about the role of the military is on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to where it's growth and development\nThe Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most to boost Brazil's development and I think Shia international markets have got to

the sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor ... stokes about a\nI mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on it just didn't need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many interviews acknowledge that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of industrialization of the country the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and a lot of studies that support that\nHe's government is clearly one that the fans that production of the size of the state the reduction of spending he's\nAlready has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro markets and for all you really form\nShort history Monica nothing

through together hastily\nRight and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues and I think a doctor mark group is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic mind side of the military and\nThe lip routine which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced finance minister Paolo gathered

well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil but ... days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in our lives\nWe have two different very different projects with these two very different approach\nIn one side we have a view of a sudden our itself as a liberal surrounded by mid century a nationalist on the other side it has a dodge\nWho has a kind of a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage ought to have a presence [noise]\nSo what we have ever is lawless state

presumed development history lit hold on to those two quite distinct views\nOf which way the economy may go I wanted to come back to this idea of Brazil's relationship with its ministry 'cause I think that is part and parcel of this agenda that also has talked about traditional family values very tough on crime and so on\nThere is a memory of course of Brazil's minute dictatorship which is still

strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics waged two attacks in city than populated areas\nTo bring international pressure and of course pressure on the Afghan government um uh that said we have been working at protecting call it a ... a population centers\nUm you hear of the news of the extraordinary of attack that happened but you don't hear of all the attacks that have been preventing that we have been preventing our security institutions have been a improving their their service system to prevent them and prepare themselves for the changing tactics\nThat about how well you tell the guy who are fleet of either I I\nI'm so sorry to interrupt ms might have been it is difficult with us the lay on the line and you tell me about the scale of the Taliban threat the more I get completely confused about what your own government isn't doing in response for example why is it\nThat you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised\nTo actually deliver security to the Afghan people as I understand that your according to the Pentagon your force numbers both in the police and the armed forces on now at least ten percent below\nThat expect to strengthen the numbers appear to be dwindling and not only the numbers are dwindling the morale is most definitely dwindling as well\nWhen we look at just the numbers and I I think without the context it obviously seems a very bad but we have been working on reforms in our institutions so some of those ... number is what it seems like we're actually inflated\nIs this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste\nYes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is\nTo provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is to support the ... and particularly the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military a privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable costs we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan and why is all my college ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with didn't negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where\nWhere do you and I'll and I'll just because we have a new I don't think it'll take me a straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote\nThe moment it takes probably thirty minutes what is happening across\nSucking off to forty defense of and the only known of it\nI mean the movement in\nFor me so you have to believe in May of resolution [noise]\nSo he's a big question do you think there's going\nSomeone to get in on one of these red lines John\nYou know ...\nMonths at the moment are going to [laughter] what do you I mean they're going out and I\nSo what's clear is that any change to the ... would be a huge issue\nFor a company like this\nEspecially when you consider that a call ...\n... the ... [noise]\n\nA place that really really illustrates the challenges to board a present such a [noise] it's a form that actually struggles ... fields here but the moment I'm In a note on and in the u._k. and the ah there's a little stream of hedge\nAnd on the other side I'm just crossing it now on the other side here\nIs the Republican bought and didn't or the farmer who owns this land is Henry McIlroy\nSo how difficult would it be to close this boat or do you think that they're cutting\n... yeah you're just like the whole thing by ... ... troops to know when I hear them on stage they're cooking I'm told about but they still talk to you on the court proceedings ... on the equipment I told the situation\nWhen the ... the British troops were using they couldn't ...\nNo one will say this ... years I've been using the ... what are those are new standards obese I never\nUse our knees suffered coming into ... so the u._k. and crossing through this little ... hand yeah becomes a person's right through into a into the European Community so xenophobic I'm On a\nShort drive from the food you know I'm a brings me to market hill in Northern Ireland\nSo I went about things like ... ... an independent trying to like this\nAre you worried the might be a hard border again with up at ...\nAt least country far worse than not here we've had type bombs on her door and businesses here ... years and I to be honest I think Theresa May has Ninety five percent of\nThe ... the other side of the shelter she's come see so you know what I'm saying I don't know what\nComes through very clearly from those interviews is how important it is for ... everyone who lives works near the border that it stays open\nSo wide on and divided and why is this division still such a sensitive issue that is what my colleague ... ... Amanda focused and a freelance journalist from Belfast in Northern Ireland\nI didn't because I did indeed teachers fictions the republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland which is part of the ... case who governed by Britain within Northern Ireland are are\nThree sets of people there are people who have a British identity people have an Irish should end today and then the group in the middle that have a mixture of those identities\nSo the union is to people with the British identity one term in part of the United kingdom whereas the other side won't the whole island of Ireland to be one\nNation I not to be governed by Britain's that's where the conflict came into it or not still a cultural war still a political war so the Nineteen Ninety eight Good Friday agreement the peace process data that was signed has given Northern Ireland a degree of stability prior to that\nWas you know decades of conflict thousands of murders and bombs and people were fair to just the troubles which\nDoesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day lot fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction we knew it was time to show documents that the idea not that you might go back to there being any sort of the it presents or a military presence or anything like that along\nThe border of deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is April will to we established between the Irish republican ... and it's a real threat I think\nThat it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think all the hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests on maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups so get set of Republicans and what are most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are ... and all that work would become a target\nThan it is the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view if\nAll that people in all the non and too I Would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is old say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've got her head and her hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement on it's not being accept us\nHow much of a discussion topic is so the people on the day to day basis in way you are and ... is it something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking about a day in day or\nWalk Brexit has done is put the issue of the constitutional position high up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the ... the state has sort of felt the constitutional position where I was not happy with Brexit\nPeople here are talking up white Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting the union is feeding the Brexit that will strength and northern Ireland's union with Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland on the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as on the British union aside if things are now he's starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances\nI certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every TV show every talk show every polling older by these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel about\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWere in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the ...\nPropping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where there has to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda Ferguson talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations\nThe Irish border odds history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's been old to a parent in the British Parliament this week wet pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party\nHas been threatening to try and ... that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of foot\nWith Theresa May ... anonymous sources have cooled that killing zone\nShe survived so far but the border issue remains so how might it be resolved if indeed it as far as I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent robots and\nNow it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it outside our most ... can you ... how she felt this way\nTo ... you're absolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think there's ... along level she has some good day some bad days and some suffering ... relationship with her I can only describe it as a ... divided conservative policy\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look rather grim and challenging for her and that is how does she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies yes that fee brawl divide the conservative policy\nWhich doesn't more businesses and the ... too much which doesn't put a ... and on and and and and that was enough which satisfies the e twenty seven\nThey wear in ... for the rest of the effect than we saw the or\nJovi I Would be the type of the ones that is sort of [noise]\nWell ... nearby that

year also to become infected with bacteria\nThat are resistant to antibiotics these twenty three thousand or die on nearly as a result of all these infections but scientists say they've developed a new antibiotic could help in the fight against drug resistant\nBacteria with me and the student professor Graham cooked chair of the world Health Organization's antibiotics are working group I gave statistics that from the United states but\nThis is a global problem you know it's a global problem and I was saying it throughout the wealth both in rich countries in poorer countries in terms of the challenge it poses\nA particularly in Southeast Asia or we have problems with emerging resistance but we're seeing it in the u._k. as well and the real concern is that this might threaten routine

more effective for the recall I have is the new antibiotic I Believe it's pronounced\nSo this is a kind of tweak on an existing antibiotics so it takes an existing cloth and politics and it puts on an

people and does it mean response trying to get rid of that infection as a tussle for on the body tries to keep on bacteria one time and they have special molecules to bring on in and say well this antibiotic has done is to\nAttach one of these molecules so the bacteria take dance politicking at times of stress and get it inside bacteria and so\nIn doing that it becomes a lot of the natural

infection\nSo antibiotic itself could be a more effective but what about that problem than identified the views and misuse of antibiotics some making resistance develops yeah I Do I become\nSo there I mean it's a very complicated issue and there are lots of different types of different things that needs to be done\nBut to get three examples than one way of reducing them adventurous uses by
