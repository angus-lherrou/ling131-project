say one way or another if this is a case just because the data doesn't exist there's always that if\nThat is true if we don't have the evidence than the idea would be lesbian relationships move will quickly and then they get married earlier and then maybe didn't realize they made a mistake\nThey are absolutely so they're they're not spending as much time getting to know each other before they get married there or not ... for several years for example before they get married\nMaybe that would be reflected they when they ... we might have for example about the age of the people going into the relationship\nYeah no this is actually something that's very interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually been able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorce is a predictor of divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down and in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent year over the age of thirty five\nCompared to fifty two percent of men so women are marrying much younger than the men\nAnd so that could be one of the reasons why we see females same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships\nAnd make sense of suppose it then poses the follow up question as to why I was on age difference but we're probably going to be speculation about anything else\nWell this is another thing is that we know that people who were married for a second surge maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time\nAnd that's another thing that we could actually see in the in the data that we've been provided so among the women who are in same sex relationships thirty seven percent of them\nHas already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know it's a game that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nAs a researcher looked into this and related questions was do you need now to go deep or is it more detail and the dates to the office for ... of what was it different kinds of questions there was just that you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these divorces wanted to be happening for probably three\nYet time will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne of the possibilities as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among the people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men so Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorce is even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the men are waiting a little bit longer they've separated we don't know if they separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork on August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we were talking about observing relationship breaks out but she will not observing relationship ... serving the farming of paperwork and maybe men just moved from paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nUnder the slow to teach Christmas post put you've researched relationships and how they work and how they work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been off for advice as to how to keep it together and how to Cuba relationship going what would you said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who's an economist who has all of the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't last a nine year age gap is almost certain divorce statistically right\nKnowing each other very long these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually try not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of\nThe most people don't move the corners of the wedding hole instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have a larger age differences in people who are\nIn opposite sex relationships but this is not actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationships so\nThe big age difference could've been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for making comparing women and men and same sex relationship\nUp to ... and now ... investigates the age old out of rhetoric\nRock critic front and\nIt's the tag line at the successful Australian campaign to encourage the use seatbelts on that and

and they've been on Twitter if you want to comment you're listening to weld object [noise]\nWhat happens to information but objects fall into a black hole that's the question posed in professor Steven Hawkins lost academic work is called black hole entropy unsolved\nHave such a heck of it was one of the co authors of the papers you work with Stephen ... of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge and she joins me now and of course I'm oversimplifying crazily really but this is about\nBlack holes having sheets which means he dissipates black holes might disappear what happens to be objects\nAnd that's exactly what it's about we're trying to find a resolution to this problem and called information powder which is something that Stephen Hawking has been\nUm really obsessed with the last forty years we'll say on this problem as essentially as you said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole where does the information about these objects\nAnd usually we think that from the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and they want something in full into a black hole willing to mention about it pays me last forever and what we've been trying to do is to um traces information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you\nWell we're not definitely not that we we we want to step forward I'd say we've shown that I'm so there's a way of describing will be ... in the black hole an optical entropy and we've shown that that was a way that we can calculate this entropy and but this is this is just one step along the road\nAnd what's next that because I I suppose my next question is can you go further without that remarkable brain\nWell it's I mean it's going to be difficult even had a multiple intuition and amazing inside and he would often and sort of\nCut off just in one sentence something he thought it was it would be the case of what's going to happen and we'd also they're confused for a while and then you know among place have you on the right and\nIt was just so useful having somebody has some amazing and intuition about how things should walk says it will definitely it's definitely gonna be different different and more difficult without him but where I'm standing still going to try the next step really is to try and work out\nUm if we can recover how much of the information we can recover and if this description of the information paradox could possibly um actually resolve this problem and if we could recover all the information that's in a black hole\nAnd this is not just about theory is that we're learning so much in this exploration about where we all go anywhere on a planet where our universe is going\n[noise] yes I mean that the black holes wick considering all all real and black holes exists\n... sensitive after physical black holes and so they really relate to and the universe and how and things interacting with black holes and things interacting ...\nSuch as really interesting to meet you and thank you so much for explaining that so clearly ... who's also one of the co authors of the paper with Stephen Hawking a which is called black hole entropy and software I didn't ask a quick claim soft us off the air is one of those things that you see around black holes apparently it's not have obviously\nHave a look at it if
