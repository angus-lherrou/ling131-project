hindsight didn't crews ... type of seems well timed\nTo somebody in a sense of seen raccoon temperatures above and sing in recent climate history and this year is set to join them\nAlongside the global heist a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also autistic to them as they happen outfit willed where the attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you tracked\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave days and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask ... won the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without and to pretend that climate change and then the case of Dublin leaf out now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to pretend to climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen laid when all is made five times more likely\nGetting a climate change the story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of over thirty degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study they're likely to remain that way\nThe further north so into to finish places we looked at like found that it's a much much of it right then in the well we live and so it was and that's how the model then it was at least in one in Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty year then so it was a match rare event\nBut we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties at much higher than that South climate change actually made this relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the managing for ... says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where stimulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relatives to that parallel stimulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited for ... off to the finished and then with cycles are reviewing

temperatures strings cold temperatures spell ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought\nI'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nWasn't event that will have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks\nWell\n\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we I think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue with me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm and we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming up several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat war is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures then you're likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign made landfall ... raised with ... wins the Atlantic side clinics but can read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which used as a great some marketing who all of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the
