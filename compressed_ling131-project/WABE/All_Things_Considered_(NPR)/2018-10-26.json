B. B. E. news in Atlanta good afternoon I'm Jim Burress rehab cloudy skies fifty degrees now at four O. for more than nine hundred thousand people have cast their votes early in Georgia that's three times as many votes compared to this point four years ago Atlanta metropolitan states\nCollege is one of the areas early polling places student Andrew Williams says early voting on campus was an easy decision\nWhile it's definitely convenient not only my student here but I also work here so when I was taking my lunch break I had a moment to go and vote\nEarly voting is available tomorrow and Sunday at several counties across the state\nVice president Mike Pence is heading to Georgia next week to campaign for Brian Kemp the state's Republican candidate for Governor Pence will stumped for Kemp indulge in droves town in Savannah next Thursday with just a few days to go before election day November second\nMeanwhile US Senator Kamala Harris will campaign tomorrow night for Stacey Abrams need democratic gubernatorial nominee for Georgia that's at ten am tomorrow in Riverdale\nIn preparation for next year Superbowl Marta police will take part in what they're calling the region's largest emergency preparedness exercise and that's going to happen this weekend major asked in green who's leading the exercise says it's going to be an extensive drill\nAnd to the issues that a lot of voters voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead a that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think in a great many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking\nAbout that yeah to get some credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy a big change in American identity or he plays on cultural in at any of the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we can we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural wanted energy critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in a times like this I think the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump Lewis dance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about\nA a a lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example or to refugees and away the Trump Administration has not been the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a JD on at the Washington Post and Brookings Institution thank you so much good\nA lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way it's our\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in a suburb beautiful here in a very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that\nPoint was used to being independent he used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it\nSo when you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to say a big percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when he retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro in Ann Arbor Michigan\nAnd I'm Audie Cornish in Washington DC after five days and Thirteen packages containing explosive devices there's been a break in the case of Florida Man was arrested today even as new packages containing possible pipe bombs continue to arrive the suspect fifty six year old seats are says out\nFaces a variety of federal charges those include a threatening a former president and interstate transportation of explosives FBI Director Christopher Wray says they thought fingerprint was found on one of those packages which has been sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRaised ... was identified onto other packages while authorities say say appears to be a political parties and they stress that it's premature to speculate on a possible motive at the White House President Trump praise law enforcement for apprehending the suspect\nThese people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a ... it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to hear and Greg [noise] throughout\nThe week as the investigation proceeded Trump offered mixed messages and NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House to speak more about that hey there Scott I already ah so the president has made some very conventional statements during the week condemning what appeared to be politically motivated efforts to strike fear in the hearts of Americans um and we heard more of that today right\nThat's right or is there were some tough talk on the President's Day he said there's no place for political violence in our country he condemned a would appear to be this this ah terrorizing incident and as he done on a Wednesday or when a flurry of these packages surface to president made an appeal for national unity\nWe must show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens there is no country like our country is an everyday we are showing the world just how truly great we our\nEarlier this week the president had urged Americans not to demonize their political opponents or a few so they should settle their differences peacefully at the ballot box this are the kind of thing we expect to hear from President a time like this and yet these kinds of conventional messages get special attention when coming from an unconventional president like Donald Trump\nOr we saw that even this morning when he tweeted about this suspicious packages and he raised suspicions of his own what happened\nThat's right just hours before sex arrest the president was tweeting about what he called this bomb stuff and he put the word bomb in quotation marks as if to sort of cast doubt on just how seriously takes this\nHe also complained that the nonstop media attention being paid to the suspected pipe bombs was taking the focus away from politics and cutting into what he said was Republican momentum ahead of the midterm elections\nYou call that unfortunate suggested that maybe he and his fellow Republicans are the real victims of this episode not the prominent Democrats to whom the packages were addressed\nHe also sent a separate tweet in the middle of the night to CNN one of the would be bomber's targets and also when the president's favorite targets he said it's not fair the cable network can criticize him but that when he pushes back they say he's not being presidential\nAnd about that election how does the president address all this with that on the horizon\nWell that's what we're gonna be watching to see because you know here's what the president had to say at the White House this afternoon I promise to be a president for all of them\nAnd the amazing results that we've all achieved you you've you've helped us so much in your communities incredible but the result really speak for themselves\nAt a campaign rally earlier this week the president was self consciously dialing back as partisan rhetoric but you know he's got another rally in North Carolina tonight it wouldn't be surprised to see him take the muzzle often deliver more full throated partisan message That's NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House Scott thank you You're welcome\nMean meanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America ... north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fear is that really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran care than is reportedly dropped by half from some seven thousand thirty five hundred now unexpected the fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border they can be shot at\nWe had any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however a ... officer and ... had their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they can't have any value as part of this house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week he\nSaid quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know and will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the care of and that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling\nIn July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase that's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration courts\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect\nIce will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nThe Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the ride of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he is\nWith the travel ban then he'll give us his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas thanks Jon ...\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News in\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that historic and unprecedented\nOr they just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most ...\nThe our our our our ... our ashes the FBI ...\nJared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast might like that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent at it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and kept in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around our Labor Day an immoral David Sharon fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for protect spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just people who were spending more government spending was also a Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nTo their own creativity give me an example give me an example of a song that could have found a different\nYeah stranger is actually one
