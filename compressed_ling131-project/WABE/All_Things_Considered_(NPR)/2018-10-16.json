also potential for a rainbow wave\nA record number of openly L G ... people are on the ballot at least two hundred forty four according to the victory farms a bipartisan group that tracks and supports clear candidates\nToday we're going to talk with three of them a million Marquez is a Democrat in Montana she is running for the state legislature and the buildings area and she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi Gina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district\nWhich has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of a New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be teaching people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we hit broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYet this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics it's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like\nThirty years ago for someone that's my agent to\n'em [laughter] and I I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty cue candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em and to your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they will with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one\nFellow even said it gives me hope\nFor the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene Amelia do as well to those young people that are following behind us\nI Want to thank all three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking

wire this place looks kind of like the college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old\nConnected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates they set out here from ...\nHelped us depending on what level there and that's the warden showed Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community is when I was parked outside and our yard went in ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatched with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... ...\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom toes were corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison where a shirt inside out her sleeves rolled up might signal like gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDumb as putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different past the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about

not so shame [noise] you know and it's helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a garden and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around too so they're forced to live here and then he runs health services for almost ... was presidents several years ago\nHe quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all what he\nWasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in the basement\nSold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nLets say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said as you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's wanted you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six to not caused problems\nDont want to show me one other place in the prison the old mental

four years ago there are four parts of selves a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night\nThis is what

poring over the Sears catalog I had my eye on highly hobby oven\nAnd aside from the fact that you could make cakes and what I loved about shopping from the Sears catalog was nobody knew I was a kid I can browse at my own pace no shop assistant ignoring me or talking over my head to my parents\nIt turns out that feeling the ability to shop without being judged resonated in a different more profound way for black Americans in the Jim Crow era Cornell historian Lewis highland argues the Sears catalog was radical in its day\nBecause it allowed black Americans to have the same shopping experience as whites he's been pondering that legacy in light of this week's news that Sears has filed for bankruptcy professor highland welcome to all things considered thank you so much for having me why was the Sears catalog such a game changer for shoppers in the Jim Crow south\nIn the era of Jim Crow race was everything and for black Americans most of whom or rural farmers access to goods on an equal basis as whites in faraway cities at reasonable prices was a godsend and that's what the catalog was\nI mean from a practical point of view of what had happened previously was they would show up and they would be asked to go to the max aligned behind the white customers and if you're shopping back catalog nobody knows what color you are\nNobody knows who you are and in the Arab Jim Crow there was a constant active difference if you're black you had to wait until all the white customers were served you had to wait until the white store owner let you\nWhatever you want it and he may or may not have let you 'cause it was largely on credit\n[noise] so the Sears catalog appears people could read it at home that could decide what they wanted to order but there were still challenges right I'm In southern store owners fought back\nOh definitely because if you were an African American and he wanted to shop and some other way you were consisting their power and not just the power of the store owner and the power the landlord\nBut basically the power of white supremacy of Jim Crow itself and so you had lots of store owners pushing back you know burning catalogs and the street very publicly from Sears catalog and burning Sears catalog and bond fires in the streets all kinds of incentives to destroy these catalogues\n[laughter] so what did you do to keep all their customers are able to order their products\nWell he published instructions in the catalog how to simply give the requirements to the post men so you didn't have to go through the story and a lot of places\nThe post office was also the general store so it was pretty complicated even get your order submitted to the catalog but they found lots of ways to do this for rural African Americans as well as immigrants people who didn't even speak English they had all kinds of clerks available to take your order and nearly any tone\nSo your take away is what that this is a reflection on on buying power on retail as as resistance\nYeah I think it's a story of a deep contradiction between Jim Crow and consumer capitalism that you can see in lots of places particularly in this moment in near around Nineteen hundred but also later in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as African Americans acquire were buying power\nThis is part of the demand for civil rights that African Americans could use buses in restaurants and toilets in\nTheaters and everything else that's part of consumer capitalism that this is one of the essential writes a very conservative right of American Capitalism\n[noise] who Simon he teaches
