Ninety Ninety\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July President Trump made pastor\nBrunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there I'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who'd been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but\nWill for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending\nA machine he was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast\nThe indicator from Planet Money and the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one\nFree does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns free to lay which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the\nCrime to our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers\nSo present with wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that ... is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is in things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's ... looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nTracking growing category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power or\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks that's our best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's\nNot as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] that\nWas NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money\n[noise] we're finding money comes from for why a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise to send receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries more at transfer wise dot com or from their ...

P. Morgan CEO Jamie diamond still expected to attend\nYou know they've been are vying for lucrative role in the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco which is the world's largest oil company so there's a lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steven ... is also expected to attend huh\nAll right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there a civil Wall Street will be there what about Congress where what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the food is out of control what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties\nFor that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending the saddest from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think that at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president said how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing ham and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see an economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today your walk 'em out so thank you for having me on [noise]\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nEnded five forty four you're listening to it on member supported Ninety point one W.

promising to do whatever is necessary to help the state recover\nCan be far more than ... existing farm programs or just you know a typical emerges your declaration this catastrophic situation for southeast Georgia sketch step up and\nOr is that resist that has existed since the day after the November sixty twenty sixteen New Yorker is centered right here on Capitol Hill they\nEncourage mob rule mob rule carrying with some sort of coordinated strategy this week I think several Republicans who just happen to choose the word mob\nWell I think they've decided that this is a good talking point of course it wasn't all that long ago that the sound of a you know angry protesters was actually music to Republican ears back when it was the Tea Party\nProtestors who were making it impossible for members of Congress to go to their own town halls without a police escort and of course we have a president in the in the White House who has on a regular basis encouraged people at his own rallies to inflict violence on on protesters there\nBut I think that the Republicans have decided uh first of all I guess ... nothing new in politics but they have decided that\nThey see their own base a lot\nMore energized in the wake of this um this whole fight over Kavanaugh and they also think that they can use this ... this idea of mob rule as a you know as a way of bringing home the idea of what would it be like if Democrats are given back any of the levers of power\nBut David I mean the use of his were mob a lot of the protesters these Republicans are referring to are women could describing women's response to all of this as mob like backfire for Republicans among women voters this maternal\nIf I don't think so [laughter] you know uh when we we first of all we live in an age of political polarization or what what they called negative polarization which means you don't particularly have like your own party or you just have to really hate the other one so the crucial or the crucial issue is are you appalled\nDo field appalled at this moment and that's what motivates people to get active in to go to the polls and Democrats have been appalled pretty steadily for two years the Republicans had little to be appalled about but now they feel really appalled and the core message in a world of negative polarization is the people so your bed a really bad themselves\nAnd this is essentially the message Republicans are now driving home and they've eliminated the Democratic advantage and in the ... and in red states and blue states but in red states use begin to see the poll swing over the Republican direction\nHow about that I mean David right both sides have clearly been galvanized by Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were less than four weeks away from this midterm election can't you see this fresh energy driven by the confirmation hearings reshaping battle lines\nHave select absolutely if you look at the polls and again we have four more weeks before this election and uh in this era for weeks is what you know for years used to be um it it does appear that\nThat this may be helping the Democrats in the house races but it could be helping the Republicans in the Senate races in part because where those Senate battlegrounds are they are\nUh the the biggest prize is in this in the Senate elections are largely democratic held seats in states that Donald Trump won\nAnd um we are seeing a significant amount of movements in those polls toward the Republicans but you think it could help Democrats and house races because of the suburban women vote it's about the the biggest battle grounds there are largely in the suburbs where we had you know again the the women's vote is going to be absolutely crucial\nOkay I'm going to switch gears now Karen\nLate last week your paper the Washington Post had\nA big blank space on the opinion page where column from one of your papers journalists democracy show he should have been ... has been a critic of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he's he disappeared about ten days ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and he has now\nSeem to be dead your paper Karen tied his disappearance all the way to the crown prince personally how your colleagues make that direct link to someone\nYou're right the the\nYou know increasingly the presumption a bite intelligence sources on Capitol Hill any in the White House is at our colleague a Jamal ... is dead end that Saudi Arabia is to blame and one of the biggest pieces of evidence are U.S intelligence report that\nShows that the crown prince actually ordered an operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia where he was supposed to be detained that the timing of all this is unclear but it is a it's if what we're hearing from from\nTurkish sources is true which is that eight essentially is a hit squad Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the consulate\nUm it is just impossible to imagine that some kind of had an operation like that would not have happened\nWithout the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi Government and when President Trump was asked about 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWill like it John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to they\nDidn't let me turn to do you let me turn this should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nWell like the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a he's pretty honest that were selling a democratic principles were selling human rights were selling us residents life down to two for for money\nOr even stipulate at a price and so ... it's sort of ... ... it's like the axis of greed and we have the Saudis are part of it uh and the second thing that seems clear here so we have spent the last couple of years sucking up to the Saudis\nAnd you would think if that would have a good effect on Saturday foreign policy you'd think they wouldn't do the sort of thing and so the idea of flattering people to get them to do your thing flattering really dictatorial regimes that does not seem to work so that's it's a low in sodium moment for American foreign policy\nRight that David Brooks in the New York times and ... of the Washington Post thanks
