I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of the teenager look on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria have felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us thank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the ... percent but then when you look at the\nNumbers are we talking about four to think of who says versus ... says\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives oh fender why this police officers were killed in the line of duty you know we don't know exactly what they're I've often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turns that we as saying that it's dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most pressing yes we're looking more them well she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity out west I handling and they'll persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer than\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this [noise]\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it if it were\nPeople who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police found that to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last few years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is that on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity to violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus the triggering event\nThen you have to cut us off it got to come so somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in D.C than the steps of a Supreme Court you think police officers pushing back the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that the Democratic and gangs so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take your and get out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one
