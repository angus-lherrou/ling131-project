um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... it can be a turning away from family we show what is\nWhat why why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues

health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until mail at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nThis is all things considered also Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro and just the past week we've seen three high profile cases of domestic extremism too are deadly shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky the third was the explosives sent through the mail to prominent Democrats\nAll three of the suspects now in custody are men born here in the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Hi Greg hey are we hear so much about international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe ... the death toll in the past Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than him indiscriminate attacks that many of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that as if the new face of extreme is\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media\nThe Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they steady terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk\nWhat did the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to violence and we find that the believing in this sense of ... is in your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level or Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here\nI'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is this social media trail\nBut there are so many American men and expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell a who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ... but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thanks ... Thanks Ari\nFor Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and allegedly gunned down eleven people he posted I'm going in on his social media account this was an account on gab

ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ...\nThe CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition that there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nAnd want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours posts when he said specifically the words I'm going in\nWhat you expected to do what you want to censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this referral\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with troll cereal harasser as people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that gets served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment company's apps stores they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend how likely is that\nWell I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their

a range of customers from ... to travelers capital one what's in your wallet credit approval required\nCapital one bank usa NA\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I melted Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nRight first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of events earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalist and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller\nA at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four the individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nAt the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of enough\nToo muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump cough it up Chris Ruddy\nIs probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty surrounding a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against Miller very\nWeird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nBut you're Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nLast month ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child enough I'm just a a boy of seven I guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... long shot the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to sway\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn going on two separate monitor be you're going to be now you're just fear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showings here will provoke the ground but you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens and everyone will start throwing\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I melted Chang Saturday's shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to a lotta Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome thank you it's great to be here\nStart with a very basic question but it's a question that's still confound me why are Jews such a focus for white nationalist [noise]\nYou know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of white Mrs superior\nA real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how those transpire between people but also an institutional on national level's through our politics um through the way that we talk about and document our history author of the way that we manager institutions and it's an effort to maintain power\nAnd to keep people who are different um marginalized I'm separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white ... much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background\nTo white nationalist or you know are Jewish community here in the United states largely comes from immigrant backgrounds or come from backgrounds that had a strong ethnic identity when we came to this country and all we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were\nOther because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and as we're both elevated and celebrated in this country as far as our history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threats\nPeople of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate\nFrom those who have more skinned privilege because her skin presents later or wider and then in contrast we think about the hatred of Jews and if we assume that most Jews are white in this country then we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities\nSo do you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there's something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional positions that have traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic you think that's in you\nI think when we have our policymakers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes as fact\nAnd using fear\nTo marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different\nAnd the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified so what new strategies\nCan we or the Jewish community in particular employ to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember is that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our streets\nThat we know each one of us is going to come out of our houses to support the other that we will not question who needs who needs this kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and as a people that are most important strategy right now\nA lotta Kaufman is director of the Jews of color field building initiative thank you very much for joining us today Thanks so much what's imitation was my privilege\nBoston gangster James Whitey Bolger is dead\nThe age of eighty nine he was killed in federal prison in West Virginia\nBolger rose to power the Nineteen seventies while also serving as an FBI informant he spent years on the run

think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turning away

about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her

that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of
