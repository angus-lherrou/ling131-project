than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races\nBillions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects that a total of\nFive point two billion dollars will be spent during the entire election cycle the group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two\nBillion how some compare to previous midterm election spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's a thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now TV\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that a almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media\nWay up from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media uh advertising on TV for the competitive races a digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook\nYeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly a successful in the two thousand sixteen of election cycles for a lot of victors are so far I think as of today face because now to a two hundred Ninety six million dollars\nAnd uh as in terms of FCC report in digital ad spending a it's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd as we said the vast bulk of the spending is coming out of democratic candidates and you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more of a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence I think both\nCome into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states that is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling\nA by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state it represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that bombarding depressed voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMoney does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade limb to limb and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda that President placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe parish I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S [noise] that we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nIs so far impose tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in\nThese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact foreign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system

frustrated at being taken for granted by the Democratic\nParty but those women want more than attention from candidates they want to be taken seriously as candidates themselves I don't want to see more of a wise decision we found a lot of high ... or like\nHow he ... me neither\n[laughter]\nWell ... years after the first black woman was elected to Congress that was Shirley Chisholm from New York there are now hundreds of black women candidates in federal state and local elections this year our co host Audie Cornish takes it\nOur next guest pulled off one of the biggest upset wins the primary season when she dethrone to ten term democratic incumbent in Massachusetts Boston city councilwoman ... Presley had spent more than a decade working in politics as an aide to lawmakers like Senator John Kerry before\nShe decided she should be the candidate\nI've certainly been a toiling invented a democratic politics working hard to elect Democrats in the commonwealth and throughout our country and so for people to tell me that I should wait my turn my mother did not raise me to ask permission to leave and so I raised my hand\nI spoke to her about some of the optical she face when she decided to run for Congress\nWhat did trouble me and hurt me was that I was ... by the charges of identity politics throughout my campaign\nAnd it was just sort of um an assumption that my message was not appealing to or that my work had not been to the benefit of\nA broad and diverse coalition of many people\nAnd that was hurtful because that is a a play out of the G O P handbook not a charge that would have expected to be lobbied against me by Democrats and certainly not people that consider themselves to be progressive\nI Want to jump in here because um there are democratic groups that did not necessarily endorse your campaign right um the Congressional Black caucus a pack also emily's list um you had people like Deval Patrick a former governor you had John Lewis\nOf Georgia the civil rights legend who all came down for your opponent my capital on oh what\nKind of message does that send to you\nWell first and foremost I'm no Neal fight to this and I knew what I was getting into there's usually a default to incumbency I did not expect that I Would have the support of the establishment locally or nationally I knew this would be lonely I knew it would be up hill I knew that it would be bruising\nYou mentioned the idea of having to go up against incumbents right and a democratic establishment what are some of the obstacles that people who are newer to politics are going to face especially as black women are there other kinds of aspects to running that they ... they may be locked out of either by tradition or through other factors\nWell listen I was told everything\nFrom I shouldn't be wearing my hair in twists I shouldn't wear hoops\nI shouldn't be as transparent about my personal hardships and I think that more of us need to feel empowered to stand in our troops\nAnd to authentically represent our lived experience\nWhen my family dealt with the stabilization and devastation of mass incarceration having a loved one that was incarcerated in our household of having a loner battling addiction of sexual trauma and violence and the stigma of that these are universal challenges\nSo it was the idea that you're you're very biography is the kind of thing that people might have looked at as a a disadvantage and that's the thing you felt like you had to turn into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office I left school not because I didn't know the value of an education but because my mother got sick and she lost her job and I was her caregiver in battling that pre\nExisting condition of leukemia which ultimately took her life\nThat is a story that millions of Americans can relate to and we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people is because people are not\nAt the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia right if I Need to become the first black female governor there's Linda Coleman running for Congress in North Carolina why now it's been many many years where there haven't been that many women of color running what do you think is different\nWell to be clear\nEven though we have an ad that leadership parity in gender and race black woman had been a leading in faith communities and social racial gender and economic justice movements we been on the frontlines we've proven that our votes matter\nThat our voices matter and now we're proving that our leadership matters the poll sat us down my Thirteen points and we won by Seventeen because we expanded the electorate and ultimately you can't poll transformation and that is\nWhat is a foot in this country right now but you can't vote for the best candidate if they're not on the ballot\nAnd so more of us have to run\nAn of Pressley Boston city council thank you so much for speaking with us thank you that's a out of ... with no Republican challenger next week she is set to become the
