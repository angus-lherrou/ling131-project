ads that popped up in recent weeks one from Republican John ... whom Delgado is trying to unseat the ad features fast those wife a cancer survivor\nJohn knows firsthand how important health care for family\nThe truth is he a guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting condition this is one of\nA recent crop of ads were GOP candidates promised to protect people with preexisting conditions President Trump has been saying the same thing but then the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage that's according to the Kaiser Family foundation Larry Levitt\nInsurers would have still have the guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions but for people who are uninsured and had a pre existing condition they might have food prohibitively high premiums which would have put coverage of way out of reach\nAccording to a September ... from Kaiser even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections however let it points out a flipside to the policy\nWhen you see a guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions premiums go up especially for people who are out there\nAnd this has long been part of the Republican argument that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and furthermore force people to get insurance they didn't want however there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining for example the finer points of pre existing conditions and there is a good reason for that\nThere's a truism and politics that if you're winning or losing\nMichael Steele is a Republican

things got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash\nOf teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around our whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know picked up by your bootstraps mentality Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for him and does\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAnd she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first\nAnd also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental\nHealth

support this NPR station\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I notice that change it's been three weeks and a day since dissident Saudi journalist ... show she went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince or said whether he believes NBS as he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi kingdom policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young he has called the crown prince impulsive and reckless\nAnd says the U.S should send the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S incentives Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say uh over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi heir apparent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust in installments pledge to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years\nIn Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like Indiana State a graduate ... in Washington Post journalist\nSo these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding\nThe government in Riyadh to account on account of these actions\nAnd on holding Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress have been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the crown prince to be replaced you agree that that would be a good step\nWell look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know had been involved\nIn this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out\nUh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more and we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in the sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms ... arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\nLook I think that the number of jobs are the ... ... lead the loss from this uh are frankly fairly minor I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action that\nCountry happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous\nKey to affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the presidents do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh jeez death\nWell I think uh the president's message I gather more information it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump's I've been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever him and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide as valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental values as strongly appear to have done in this instance and the ... the only\nRepublican senator tot young of Indiana thank you very much for joining us thanks so much Elsa\n\nHome sales are dropping in some cases dramatically this could be a sign that the housing market is finally cooling off NPR's Camila Domonoske reports the Commerce

home values were rocketing up but now it's a very different picture the housing market is weakening\n... have been falling prices a few appreciating but at a slower pace\nLawrence unit the chief economist for the national association of realtors he says this is not a mysterious situation the fed has been raising interest rates after a long stretch of low rates as a country recovered from the great recession\nThat means rates for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage or now closing in on five percent for the first time in years and that makes it more expensive to buy\nA house so you would expect to see a drop in sales and that's not the only reason sales could be slowing that sharp increase in home values it has consequences you and says in the booming housing market prices were rising too much too fast and\nPrices during a century fifty percent over the past six years what people's income growth barely rose above ... percent\nThat mismatch was pricing new buyers out of the market with that in mind he says a slowdown in sales is not a bad thing if it leads to more sustainable price increases and for now home prices are stabilizing\nAs for what's next the fed is expected to raise interest rates again and it's the economy remains strong and jobs and wages continuing\n... says the housing market could be fine with that ...

things considered from NPR News I'm alpha Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a by your bootstraps mentality Kathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids I think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kinda just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and\nAlso that she may be able to recognize\nSomeone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms\nWith a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nFortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to\nAll the kids in the school had
