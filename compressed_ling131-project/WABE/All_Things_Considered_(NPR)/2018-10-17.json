Northern Ireland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would have run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get enacted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nSaying he's usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was that today we will have already some for a solution on the table but it looks like it'd be a deal\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind\nWhat about some of the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\nI well I Would say she's the cheerleader today I mean she says that the u._k. position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the e council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThat seems to be with a very hard in order to ensure that we see dress seized issues of what we've seen is that we sold most of the issues in withdrawal agreement of ... and she knows the time to make you tough [noise]\nShe also wouldn't say or what she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the ... which is something that sunny you leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about elaborate\nOn that I mean what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you\nWell right now the agreement is more or less that ah when the u._k. leads on twenty ninth of march next year\nThat basically until the thirty first of December the following year another was twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the u._k. and you would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all of this is the specter of a Britain might leave you without a new might just crush out yeah and that's something that everyone is is quite worried about um besides the fact you'd have snarled borders and\nPrice hikes for good or is it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example were analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard brags that as it were\nA hundred and fifty billion while and fierce arrests are hard enough and reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S George Parker has written about this he's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program hello [noise]\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a tightly held chicken acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad don't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border say you would have a immediate you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues to the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on a seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nIt will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big ...\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit ... sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor placing otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some ... percent of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nAnd you name it they will they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago\nThe differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy bucking London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure

the options\nThis is what South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News for that would do I know what I'm going to do on fashion the hell out of Saudi Arabia of course Senator Graham can't impose sanctions on his own but there are quite a few Democrats and Republicans in Congress already calling for unity of measures\nFor more on this we're joined by NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre ... hey Ari President Trump could impose sanctions is there any sign that he would do this either on his own or with Congress\nAt this point no everything that he said and he's address this several times as recently as today has been\nThe Saudis are denying this we're not going to make them guilty until proven innocent he's stressing that Saudi Arabia is an ally part of this us coalition against Iran\nSo if he maintains that position the overall response is is us response is likely to be quite mild but Congress in private business can can do a lot and could forces hands in some ways you say that\nCould do a lot what specific sorts of things might they do well\nFor example the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has to sign off on arms deals and and for the past year they've really sort of been raising a bit of a stink about the way Saudi Arabia has been conducting his war in Yemen with with us munitions and us up planes\nOr if any new big arms contracts came before them they could block it there aren't any at the moment but they could do that um we had the the Russian example last year were Congress overwhelmingly approved sanctions against Russia and then the the president was really forced to accept them\nSomething related to to the so called Magnitsky Act where which which Congress infected vote just last week so the president now has four months to either impose some sanctions or explain why he doesn't want to and private businesses shying away from this big conference in Saudi Arabia next month\nI was just in march that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was here touring\nA who's who of American companies Google and apple and Lockheed are trying to attract them they may now shy away from South\nSo those are a lot of diplomats are there's a lot of economic uh options what about diplomatic possibilities what steps could the U.S take there\nReally two things I think to to keep an eye and one is this war in Yemen the Saudis are heavily dependent on the usa fly\nF. Fifteen ... airplanes to to carry out airstrikes\nUnited States supplies the weapons the maintenance the training if the U.S threatened in any way to to limit that cooperation that would severely restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war and there'd been high civilian casualties and that's something the U.S could ...\nThe Saudis on if they so chose\nThe other is this boycott of Qatar Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar is a very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there um and and so that\nUh is something the U.S could could stress and say hey play nice with Qatar we want these are all we're both were all in this together um let's let's end that boycott\nOut Saudi Arabia reacting to the possibility of the sanctions would their response likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try to drive up prices although that goes very much against their the way they've always done business\nUm interesting factoid or the Energy Department announced just last month the U.S has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer\nAbout eleven ... million barrels per day so Saturday El Al is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a reminder that relations are often strain the thing you often hear when talking about a U.S in Saudi Saudi Arabia's these are countries that share that share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you\nYesterday President Trump compared the ... case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring that confirmation debate the Supreme Court justices themselves largely kept quiet now the Kavanaugh is on the court chief justice John Roberts is speaking publicly trying to make sure that the bitter fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nTo chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a defective civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act within them that job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches the story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decisions the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during world\nWar two he shared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument and the case in before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a small thing perhaps but it is they repeated reminder\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation and I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that\nTo the best of our abilities whether times are called or contentious\nJohn Roberts chief justice of the United states speaking yesterday in Minnesota [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nUh Florida has some of the toughest building codes in the country but certain areas are exempted from rules that would protect against storms like hurricane Michael that story coming up later on all things considered on Ninety point one W.

B. eat out or\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S\nGiven that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states\nSaying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past campus use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on so you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in in the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was\nShaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay\nFor when last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nI mean this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational a floor families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well educated\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher in ... ... or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and his awaiting recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be proven over such as it is a way that she is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida

S. but also the Yemen itself\nI imagine there's also contracts that you can follow tracing Saudis reaching out to lobbyists who they want to reach out to the private sector or for talking ...\nYes so a great example of that is um one of the lobbying groups that Saudi Arabia hired recently was founded by\nHoward Buck McKeon who was the former chairman of the house armed services committee and one of their other clients is Lockheed Martin which is one of the defense contractors that sells arms to Saudi Arabia fairly regularly\n[noise] I also mentioned think tanks and have those donations and grants those are a little bit harder to track explain why\nExactly so the foreign agents registration act is not well enforced by the department of justice they rely on a policy of voluntary compliance and they haven't really clarified what activities in relationships are covered by the law\nI think tanks have traditionally not been required to register under the foreign agents registration act\nThere is a rule in the house that when non governmental witnesses particularly think tank experts are asked to testify they have to file what are known as truth in testimony forms in which they have to disclose any foreign funding received within the last two years as it relates to the subject of the hearing\nUnfortunately have the as it relates to the subject of the hearing has ended up being very narrowly interpreted so\nFor instance a hearing on Iranian backed militias which has a table of experts from I think tanks who specializes in Middle Eastern policy and receive millions of dollars from governments like Saudi Arabia Qatar and United Arab Emirates\nWhich really do have an interest in this topic they'll undisclosed\nSo this is a long standing practice of countries such as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing grants or other donations to big think tanks are that are influential what are you doing it thanks so much for stopping by thank you for having me she's an investigator with the project on government oversight\nPresident Trump often criticizes people he has appointed two top jobs in the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nThat going on what is the fed because the fed is ranging rage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat was Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House and the ... and NPR's re Berliner joined us to tell us more about this ... hello or let's start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nWill back in July he said he wasn't happy with the food rate hikes he suggested that the good interfere with the economic expansion and then more recently right after the stock market so off you complain again the some a lot more strenuously you said the ... gone crazy\nWas out of control then yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat\nNow the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independence but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend his policies if they get criticized\nYet we heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independent so I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nYeah that's true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William ... this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and in Nineteen sixty five LBJ some and Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talk\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks happening\nNow his rhetoric not surprisingly how blunt it is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other president who said the fed is crazy\nOr what when presidents are unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents ... lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally make presence more popular but I can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House that can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also serves kind of at the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere's no indication of that the fed is supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed Powell and that the fed is independent but the fed is really seemed to have gotten the fed is really seem to have gotten under your skin to NPR's Uri Berliner thanks for joining us today You're welcome [laughter]\nIt's all things considered from NPR
