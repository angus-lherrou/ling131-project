requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says Leno's should have their own standards because they're neither Carson or buses\nRegular she started to Janet in between the two of them out and have come up with that thing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThis is all things considered ... and I'm Mary Louise Kelly hurricane Michel heads the Florida Panhandle today with wins upwards of a hundred and fifty miles per hour\nThe storm is expected to plow northward through Georgia and the Carolinas and ... some places still reeling from Hurricane Florence\nPlaces such as New Bern North

so that in the event of a twenty to forty miles per hour when that this or to bring material will stay put not scattered\nBut let me let me back you up because when we talk to you not quite four weeks

looking to evacuate or telling people to stay safe stay put\nWorld stand by we have an emergency operations center that we have not activated we have forty one trucks\nPicking up debris as quickly as we can we have nine cities and towns across the state that are helping us for that effort we just uh you know we're all in prayer for our friends down in Florida Georgia South Carolina what that this thing will not be anything like the impact that we have for SARS was a storm surge and\nAppears to be more of a of a high when\nThere is anything on the weekend by the time it hits it hits you we hope when\nYou say you've got people are picking up debris you're talking about to brief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that's just come down newly since then with when\nOil what's kind of like in phases we uh the initial debris from the shock of of what happened and and now folks are are getting in getting the inflation out from underneath their home yeah they're finding out that their heat pumps and HVAC systems have been compromised the duct work\nAnd so a sheet rock and and all the components of the home or you know we just uh after careful inspection by our respective department as many as ... ... says we found that there's a lot more details of what has to be done than than what we initially thought\nYou've still got a lot of buildings their houses businesses et cetera was with ... for ... after Hurricane Florence is that right\nWhat we still have seven hundred homes of twenty two thousand\nThat we cannot re power because the electric components were were compromised during the storm of the ... and we're working as hard as we can with the owners to get licensed contractors electrical contractors to come in and correct there's problems that we

of the population United States lives within fifty miles because they love it we love it\nIt's the quality of life that that doesn't get any better and yeah we just really can't think America enough for what they've been doing for us and we in turn are working with our sister towns and cities around New Bern Jones county ... county right to try to help them get back together\nWell mayor Dana outlaw of New Bern North Carolina we wish you good luck and stay safe thanks so much\n[noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks all their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent declined to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what parts of the markets on this planet today\nWell a tech was particularly had hired a it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gain since mid summer\nBut the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said I just wanted the foundations of the mark and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred ... which also has a lot of tech lost three and a third percent so it was a tough day day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate on the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates were actually suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually\nAnd as soon as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go\nThere are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifth year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more insight flashing pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... ... good for the stock market what happened well\nThe economy is strong in the U.S and most common dangerous saying today cell of his not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so I have emerging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago and of course there are these concerns about global trade war a disrupting\nA the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nSo what we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend\nWell most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading\nUh driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit is it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are are are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months\nA year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie thanks time You're welcome [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn Wyoming state officials

administration's role backs John ... is with the Environmental Defense fund\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to have buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by and then you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and they only do rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistance to using the eighth through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception\nIt was even a challenge to make it routine at Vanderbilt\nHospital here in ... and continuing Joanna starlings or clinical pharmacists

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same game on private planes headed for Cairo and by\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ... correct\nIs is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that descend these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but\nIt shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's\nNot clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so mom or who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman absolutely\nA jerk ... M. B. S. so see sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v weight that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nAnd from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I now said Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he\nMade a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nMajority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would be literate\nMedicare and limit Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's claims and one of those facts ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities\nIt also taps into our pocket books in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters\nEspecially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place in the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their tour and they're campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare\nFully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to define the results in the November sixth election and that is health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tech\nThirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money and it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job the federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill\nBut we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their hotter seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto them in like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and break when you actually have to debate the the details of the plant\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa is probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare and they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees\nThe insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got\nYou're welcome parts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gusts of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm has passed\nThat the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate\nWithout a without you\nTo Gary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owner is giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\n... and they know China over the age I Love to go to a game of the month of able to do it at all like\nHumans to Mars girlfriends Harris who kings sits in a chair by the front door her head in her hands I'm stressed out [noise]\nThe red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back schools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during a hurricane we actually opened back up to date for the public after the hurricane um but we received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business\nI came in for a few days to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming small businesses\nAre especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless a business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced you can't get them back [noise] so it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disapprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by Tom Gjelten NPR News Wilmington North Carolina\nHere listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThis\nTerm being
