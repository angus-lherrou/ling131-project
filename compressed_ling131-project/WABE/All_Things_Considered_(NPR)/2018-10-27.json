will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house\nSo we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Allen Say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nThis is a seismic shift in the politics of this state mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenge last year and a lawsuit there was aimed not in federal court where some of the gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court and in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to\nAnd immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle it's just character assassination if you have ever mister tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated and amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country in a lot of that has to do\nWith the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Bryant that's Patrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace was never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assaults on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together is money in politics\nOut about it pretty much of a ... really\nDo you know if you know of anyone who was hurt\nI I don't uh unfortunately this on uh as far as I Know are they still have not been able to notify the families of those who have died and so uh so so far nobody knows\nWhat you tell us about the congregation what kind of cynical I wasn't what stands out from your\nBut all the same ... tree of life a was a combination of two synagogues in Pittsburgh emerged to conservative synagogue to really lovely welcoming place um it's in the heart of squirrel hill which is\nA central part of the Jewish community a lot of the population of George Pittsburgh and ... just a wonderful warm and welcoming place\n[noise] and and I wanted to ask you about this this has to just strike at your core\nAnd forgive me this news is so fresh you probably haven't haven't had time to process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind at a at a time like this I mean did you did this ... strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing this\nReally a I'm a shock does anybody in this community you know the truth is that\nAh we're lucky in Pittsburgh but generally the Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states um we've had a community security director for a couple of years has really been improving\nSecurity at the synagogue in that church agencies and so this comes as even more of a shock to me and everybody here\n[noise] how do you think you'll process to spend the next couple of days\nThat it's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering or tomorrow at five PM oh that's a\nReally all of the synagogues and in Pittsburgh are participating and I think\nIn my mind it's time to come together joined together as a community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh has a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm\nSure there are many grieving with who are not Jewish what what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing outpouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh or even now you know just a\nA couple of hours after this\nTerrible incidents um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and gotten tax than emails from churches I think that uh\nYou know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community he'll some if people want to give we're going to open an aftershock bought a closes a fund for victims of terror and uh they can certainly contribute\nTo that I'm sure she read it there for now Mr Huntsman thank you so very much for speaking with us it's such a sensitive time I think he's still very much and thank you this is NPR
