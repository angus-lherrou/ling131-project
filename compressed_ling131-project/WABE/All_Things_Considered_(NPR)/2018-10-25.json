us border with Mexico to keep a caravan of thousands of Central Americans from crossing illegally Here's NPR's Tom Bowman\nDepartment of homeland security has made a request to the Pentagon to send

border we're told they're going to be military police and engineers again to assist border patrol not to take part in any sort of a law enforcement activities\nAnd we're told will likely be active

we'd be done to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how in the century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weekend they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and what I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and away right I mean the Saudis backed the president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran um what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfolds here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap\nThat's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity and they have said that they will make up any deficit in a rainy and crude and keep oil prices steady now so far\nOr Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those taps this all begins on November fifth and November fifth what's the significance of that date November fifth is when the U.S sanctions go into effect that is when it will become very difficult for the Iranians\nTo sell any of their oil on the global market\nThat's NPR's Deb Amos thanks so much for it\nJust to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and that was found units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern ... countries would have been southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual apps who of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad\nBut it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of as a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest Trevor homeland security most of these\nLaws are under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is just sheer he wasn't able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather the information finding ... agreement in our community we you know we all agree want us to cure the border that we have to have\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages had been intercepted so far the packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now\nAnd this story is put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city of miles either we don't know anything yet about who deliver these packages of what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question or earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service\nOr the packages addressed for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also found in postal facilities in Delaware obviously that's important because us PS has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like\nThis when it comes to nail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening procedures\nSo it's really different based on a number of different factors\nYou know the size of the package for instance or maybe most importantly is who that package\nIs going to if you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious\nLooking items so these suspicious items that we are talking about a period of ... up and sent using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with they can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own male\nAnd the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have cars can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYeah it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they the the U.S Postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective\nA specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into\nA hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax ah bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics or is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nOr not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now ah I talked with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials and the media members in the case of CNN who seemed to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying patch point a to point B were also in danger in ...\nSituations or if you remember back to two thousand and one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we're definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat is NPR's Miles parks thanks so much thank you

[noise]\nAnd from listen like you who donate to this NPR station\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy Clinton comments she made about black face justice week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nMichele I'm Megan\nKelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David chaotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] it's really you get in trouble if you are a white person who's like on the wane or a black person it puts on white we like that was okay as long as you were dressed like a character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich being a pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShows a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to perhaps the newest co hosted today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line but this was political correctness run among um that's\nAnd it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nUh NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted uh a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and\nI ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fire as a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear and um we do every year uncouth which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface advent and not advocate Halloween is is Christmas at all companies in this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk\nNPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish there are still thousands of Central American migrants making their way north as part of the caravan\nThere so far from the U.S border a thousand miles or so in response to the United nations refugee agency un agency are has sent dozens of staff to southern Mexico to help with asylum applications I reach UNH ER communications officer Maria ruby there she told me about Seventeen hundred people in the caravan have already\nApplied for asylum in Mexico\nWe asked him to Mexicans are making processing these applications\nBut also a provided legal advice counseling for the people that are in the cabinet if they present to address that guy that we are facing that make snow\nI mean it's still a person is that if I'm prize for people who are\nMy great they may not have to find an editor life people now that running away from conflict on ... in ...\nSo you're saying that there is a mix of both economic migrants and people who are seeking asylum because they fear of persecution in their home countries or fear violence do you have people in the caravan who are making it clear to you that they wish to go to the United states\nOr not they may come as we have a seat from ... class of ... life in that fast not necessary in the U.S but the ways in Mexico\nThere has been a lot of concern in the U.S about the numbers of people who might be trying to apply to asylum in the U.S has un agency are received any pressure from the Trump Administration to process people they're\nNot not that time that that are ... I think it's I think it can be very clear we have actually create all these is in South of Mexico whining about your lap and I wanted to see can I just got so\nThat you have any ... like we are facing currently is that in the house and the Mexican government receive around almost six thousand\nPages for asylum\nThese theyll be that would take you need to go see their age and they they had like ... we I think that the we have received the end of September ... drinking fountain obligations\nUNH ER is identified kidnapping and other security risks is that something you're talking about that's a risk within the caravan or from outside of it\nI think I find a cat that we have nothing in Cyprus said these things are just I Love the fact that the Taliban is thank you might not\nWhat we are advising people they used to be careful to leave the fire of a group that they don't look I Know they might face when I Would have had it on their\nFats and they can be either ... or Richard that set the stage\nAs we mentioned we're catching you as you're traveling along this group was there any other person or family that stood out to you or them or their story [noise]\nI mean and the counties comprise bad luck to feminist for half a gel gyms and and that's not much ikea than are on that five years on and are people that really and when they decided to leave that country is because they don't have anything else\nThey security threats five a between negative ... high that they they've decided to leave and I think we had an artist to survive\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us from ...\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neil is a senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and she knew you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your\nArgument is so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more and\nFind a link to leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places that some people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now\nWants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country\nIn the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars and other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national\nAnd nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would\nYou tell them that you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News it's\nThe five forty four on Ninety point one WB even I'm Jim Burress by de Ryan Anderson works in marketing for a local agency by night weekend early morning\nWhenever he's not as a day job he's the person behind Georgia votes dot com\nAnderson defines it as a simple website that takes publicly available early voting information and organizes it in a way that is useful and since going online about a month ago it's gotten quite the following Ryan interested welcome thank you very much glad to be here\nHow would the data you present on Georgia votes dot com be useful to the average person shore\nSo what I've tried to do is take the data that the secretary of state is putting out there every day with information about vote by mail accepted ballots and in person\nAnd break that down by a couple of different dimensions that they also make available so understanding where those boats are coming from different parts of the state as well as by the demographics of the people who are voting and then\nThe part that was kind of what got me interested in the first place was understanding the people who are voting how did they behave in twenty fourteen so were they early voters and twenty fourteen where they day of voters and twenty fourteen or did they not vote at all and twenty fourteen ... is there really a surge of turnout coming from a new voters\nAnd what does that tell us about either the outcome of the vote or engagement of uh the people who are voting early\nYeah so I always want to be a little careful to try to get the outcome what I Do think it means right now is that\nThe other person I Want to bring up is mc light because I think well I think a queen let's see if it's someone who does kind of like singing and wrapping and feels very mainstream I feel like in the light went really hard [laughter] uh and we have ... here ten percent\nTo change

attractive [laughter] being about attractive to men um and it feels like that something I mean I remember from eighty eight\nWhy I think overall in eighty eight the premium was to be original unique and really attempt to push the platform forward so what we see fc like what we see ... who was around that time as well uh let's see for\nWhere we see all the the men who we well we've already mentioned as well is that it was super competitive and it was just like the the doors wide open and and the possibilities which is endless\nYou also see artist having an eye on expanding that that

with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond and become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron\nJohnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you\nWell Marilyn how are you doing\nI'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national\nEmergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is a legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and that was found me and it's set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was that that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that no true for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this or that I've had I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain ... people opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of arthritis driven homeland security most of these\nLaws are under my major's diction we've got it or to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is just sheer he
