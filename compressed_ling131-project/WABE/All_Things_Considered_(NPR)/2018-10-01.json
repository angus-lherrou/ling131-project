us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going on\nRight

which is a deal where rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data just restrictions and these are all rules that

and in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments\nWith the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in\nAnd get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books were not open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so the department\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour\nListens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then a little while later an odd assortment of\nYoung people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaigns for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather\nSo it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance so\nIf you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing\n\nIs all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I also change the FBI is three days into its week long investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo understand what a supplemental probe up this tight might entail we reached out to a Jack o wins he's a former FBI agent he's conducted plenty of background probes into federal judges\nAnd he walked me through how he would go about this one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home\nPerhaps Dr Ford to ride around with agents we don't have much time you know we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood where the general area and we might be able to find the house they're also real estate records available at the FBI would investigate\nLet me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that jobs her memory to point out the half\nI absolutely would Elson\nAnd you would try to look for you said floor plans of houses in the neighborhood yeah matched the description from her memory\nI Would in her memory is there is in the living room right inside the front door stairway up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered some written calendars from his high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOur interview everyone on my calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer or so July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nWell to do it quickly could do a polygraph of all three people involved in the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and a doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\nOkay there are allegations that involve Kavanaugh's behavior well under the influence of alcohol on during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough job of his drinking habits in high school and in college\nYes al ... in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn up the information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have said a background investigation cannot what tell me why do\nI I Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's\nReally a while this staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents assigned this case agents on backgrounds are well trained who've done it many times\nIt turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on a Supreme Court does he happy I have a responsibility to pursue those additional leads\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case agent I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope according to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth with those additional interviews\nDo you think the idea has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI good requesting additional time if they found new evidence new information about the wide background is being conducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the quest\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOh You're welcome Elsa thank you\nEven as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so with only eight justices Republicans had hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg without the court today and has this report\nDid they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among then given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president assure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court the president never really answered the question\nWell you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation that was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued a challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis species lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone after a little ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the Fox case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that\nAt some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on if built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nIt's the five forty
