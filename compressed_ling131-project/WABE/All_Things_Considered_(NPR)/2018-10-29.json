believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie turkey which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very quiet very isolated lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he used the PO box for not the sort of a mailbox that his apartment which is just south of synagogue\nBut I spoke to a friend of his crew has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm rubber ... hours as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle which social cues and the two of them were friends and they would play together they would build things together they would take things apart [noise]\nUh they would build bombs together as sort of pranks and blow up watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart and Robert hours became quiet or more isolated\nThen in high school eventually just disappeared and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue\nAnd the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name\nAnd that he was pretty much goes she would come and go\nAnd sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\nAnd there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year she spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nNeeded a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry\nAnd he seemed to find a like minded community\nOn Gabrielle crucial media network that has become more popular among All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president didn't escape his\nAnger and he seems to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that\nMr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think ... is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks of the next couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did he become as hates\nAs he did and how long has that been going on and what role do Internet playing\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack from the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I know\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump are as seemed to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha

I'm Jim Burress\nWhen you go to the doctor's office you get a lot of questions about your safety potentially like did your kids where their bike helmets how do you store your message but very few doctors asked about guns and that might have everything to do with what they learned in medical school\nFor guns in America WABC ease Lisa Hagen reports\nIt's lunchtime at Atlanta's Emery university and about a hundred medical students are busy scarf down their meals in a lecture hall here on their own time to learn about how to talk to a future patients about gun safety for\nOne hour that was

... do you wear your helmet you wear your seatbelt but we just don't talk about firearms\nPublic health groups believe raising patient awareness around the risk of firearms can help reduce gun deaths

border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves who a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week old there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or the wrong way to support role again and the plus you've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits military from engaging in\nLaw enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border I recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past it again in a support role\nIn this case you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who is doing everything to get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or fears staff and a a good general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nA border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom\nYou're welcome in their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he's betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nThat took her belly we spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted tobacco the president's agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro the man accused of sending more than a dozen package bombs too high profile Democrats critics of President Trump and CNN made his first court appearance today fifty six year old she's our say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted\nDanny Rivera from member station WNPR and was in the courtroom and joins us from Miami Hi Danny\nHey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us\nWhat happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk I'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti democratic pro Trump's and anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bill because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan jumpsuit\nHe didn't see much um but when he talked he did sound kinda defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield them from from the view and once that started happening I'm the judge us them a series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of not a dummy and he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and the\n... yeah and ...\nSorry about that um you could see you could see he was upset at some point you his face kind of turn red who was tearing up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too well and\nAnd this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not where his trial is going to take place explained that yeah\nSo the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York um he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original I'm hearing is taking place but he will at some point be taken up to to New York\nUh the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs\nWere mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nUm the the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there is no plea deal\nI'm In the meantime the next hearing the the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so he'll beer here at least until then and at that point we'll learn whether he'll be released on bail\nOr if you're going to be transferred up to New York for for more hearings\nRight that is Danny Rivera reporter with member station WFCR in in South Florida thanks very much standing\nThanks for having me\nWe're going to take the next few minutes to remember to be eleven people killed at the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nTwo brothers inseparable and devoted to their synagogue Cecil and David Rosenthal Cecil was fifty nine five years older than David the brothers live together in a community home in Pittsburgh run by achiever that's an organization that helps people with disabilities\nChris show ... is vice president of residential supports with achieve it and she joins me now via Skype to remember the Rosenthal brothers a crush of welcome and I'm On my condolences on your last I'm so sorry\nFor uncle ... that\nDescribe Cecil and David for me what were they like\nGay and fulfill were larger than life\nRight or a terror that are ... ... ... worth selling trying to the fabric of their lives to rock throwers or hell they would stop and talk to her every line an adult wine\nAnd I read that she had an official role he was a greeter at the synagogue\nFaced were hot only a greater than that I Would refer to him as far back fitter to throw hell he was always ... how are you gay and\nLive a very reserves her thing finishing that her letter today that he just opened up they were so close to their family day\nTo call his mother every single day when he got home from work\nThey got up with a positive attitude\nHow's your family how're you doing what your day look like for today blessings free today and they threw parties for everything in fact one time they had their bathrooms remodeled in their home and they wanted to throw a party for remodeling the bathroom [laughter]\nTrying to imagine that one and and and then\nThere was a next door neighbor where they had that house remodeled and they were going to put it on the market and they went to the open house because they wanted to be a part of that\nYeah what kind of work today do you describe them coming home from work\nDavid Was working for good well and cleaning and see if there was about to start a job today is awake and a family owned\nBusiness has it taken a toll on your staff who worked with them and help them for for all these years\nYes to them at such an early age excuse\nAnd they and they are such a vital part of their family our family so it is extremely difficult now\nI'm so sorry part of what also must be difficult is letting all your other clients all the other people who rely on achieve a no how are you talking them through this\n[noise] myself and another staff member went out yesterday to me with housemates so people who are down to offer them and explanation as best we can about the events of Saturday\nAnd to offer any support we are also going to offer people kind of a service where people can come and share their memories and their failings\nSo you're planning some kind of gathering within your organization to honor and remember them absolutely and it sounds like these are two brothers who like to party who would have appreciated that gesture and been right there in the mix\nI think that is exactly correct I think that on Saturday she could have counted them to be where they were\n[noise] that's where they wanted to have been the best way that we can remember them an honor then is to know that they live their life well anybody you talked to in ... new them they were well respected in their church and their family is absolutely fantastic\nAnd it's one of the best situations that could ever be\nThat's for sure with achiever talking about David and sea salt Rosenthal the brothers were killed Saturday as we attended services up the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh pushups thank you thank you [noise]\n\nI'm In\n\nYou're listening to all things
