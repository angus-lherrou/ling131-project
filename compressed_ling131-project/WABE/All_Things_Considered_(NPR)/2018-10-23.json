the caravan keeps\nBetty and Justin safe gives them a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way she could imagine making it to the U.S for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country of ... of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has a new idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for

I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh meaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count\nWe're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls on some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on his role some cases\nThey're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it\nBut having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen that these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter will you get the idea and then there's this kitty wells relatives of Adam ...\nPublished an op ed against him saying the Republican is not fit to be governor of Nevada this is just the latest example of politicians family feud going public Laurel white of Wisconsin Public radio reports on some others house Speaker Paul\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Audie Cornish the Trump Administration says it's taking action against some of the Saudi officials it believes are responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal ... secretary of state my palm pale made the announcement today\nWe have identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr show\nDeath we're taking appropriate actions which include revoking bases entering visa lookouts and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel the head of the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because you'll just killing at the Saudi conflict and assemble NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that is it a long Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said is temple along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nTo CIA never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they are conducting these sort of separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on I'm this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's a key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending Haspel there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses um he talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and my palm pale to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who was responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\n[noise] yeah I think we saw today president or the wine gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis\nAnd and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country um turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract\nSo the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where whereas the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to to finish it up pretty quickly\nUm the ... the the Turks have or we believe the audiotapes um there's still the question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ... of the Brookings Institution um and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think are to want to enjoy watching every twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded to all this wealth\nToday was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS of backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance in and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the big question of course will be will Mohammad bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties an ailing a so far NBS is still in line to succeed him\nThat's NPR's Greg Myre thank you for your reporting\nThank you and leaving hearing the killing of Saudi journalist ... has sparked international\nOutrage that people right here in the U.S are also talking about the incident and how President Trump has been handling it North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports on how it's playing out among voters and us media outlets just two weeks before the midterm elections Carol morality and\nFriend Boston Neary working publishing and live near Burlington, Vermont both say they're definitely voting next month both

Vermont where the tour shopping and leave peeping ... says she's troubled by President Trump's focus on money and an arms deal with the Saudis rather than seeking justice for a slain journalist\nIf he was murdered [noise] um I don't think that his biggest concern for the person that's going on a ... find out and make an educated decision it was a human\nNeary agreed says she thinks Trump's tone just isn't right\nI I think that sums it up more transparent moral leadership [noise]\nThis narrative questioning Trump's moral compass on the show ... case has played over and over and media that tends to be critical of the president here's Joe Scarborough on MSNBC\nAnd then he was killed and he was dismembered and Donald Trump's response hey we get a lot of money from their or Trump's values are not American values and those are Donald Trump's values\nBut in conservative tilting media friendly to President Trump this sounds very different the Washington Post last week described a whisper campaign by conservative commentators and activists ended discredited showed some suggesting possible ties to Muslim radicals\nThis narrative has been taken up by Republican politicians including Corey Stewart a candidate for US Senate in Virginia who spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper especially when\nHe was ... was not a good guy himself\nWhat does that mean exactly not not a good guy himself well either so I mean there's a lot of stuff out there a\nOne voice leading this attack on the show gene is Rush Limbaugh less than three weeks after the Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist was brutally killed\nLimbaugh used his influential radio show on friday to describe the show G. as suspicious a man unworthy presidents concern story there's no whisper about this cabinet whispering anything when I talk about this ... stops on Saturday the Saudis acknowledged ... died in their embassy\nBut many conservative outlets have simply downplayed his death like President Trump they focused attention instead on that caravan of migrants moving north through Central America and Mexico Peter ... is the host of the program Fox and friends it will be time to deploy the military I Believe so because we haven't changed our immigration\nPolicies we did issue immigration did seem far more significant to many of the voters we spoke to they ranked protecting America's borders as a higher priority for Trump and the ... case\nMike downs is a retired state trooper in Westport New York's a Democrat who says he'll be voting Republican this year Trump is on the right track trying to correct certain things like for instance the immigration you know we watch it on television it you know I feel sorry for these people but we can't police the whole world\nWith voting already underway and parts of the country are interviews didn't find the Trump's handling of the show gee killing appeared to be changing many minds about him or the mid term elections those who favor the president seemed on troubled by the case or weren't paying that much mind\nVoters hostile to Trump said the story just reinforces what they felt before anger and outrage Brian Mann NPR News\nYou are listening
