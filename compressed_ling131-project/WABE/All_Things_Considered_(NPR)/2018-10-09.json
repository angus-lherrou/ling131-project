year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very importantly but she

can tell me she went out to be doing it for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president and an\nAll right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of this ... high also so why now why is he stepping down ... well\nThat is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote a resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my dad would look so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally main yourself she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure form\nSo for someone who does want to run for president may be some time in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as kind of a rat deserting the sinking ship\nRight might have been held it yeah so the thing was different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nIt sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a in a cellar right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of many relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get confines of the day she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different what the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately not some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician so as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but\nAre we to assume that this is really the end of her political career we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty\nUm she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared was such a hidden genius that no one\nUnderstands [laughter] of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley says she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family That's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin\nThank you [noise] the national Security Agency is the country's largest intelligence agency

intelligence agency he really likes to talk about\nWhistle blowers I felt very strongly that this was a key function for an inspector general's office to have a robust whistle blower program at\nHis

who claim they suffered reprisals\nStorage a former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms still he's playing a visible role at an agency that often seems invisible with its spy missions and classified budgets\nAnd they say it's always been the most secret agents in the United states far more sacred than the CIA\nAuthor James Bamford has written for books on the NSA and still find that challenging to get information\nLike how many people work there\nSomewhere between twenty five thousand and fifty thousand somewhere around there\nThe NSA broad mandate includes electronic

Senate in July ... released an unclassified version of a semi annual report something never done before\nAnd there's the office logo when store to arrive the office of the inspector general R. O. Y. G. had the same one as the NSA within eagle at its center\nAnd I thought wait a minute we're independent gee he put together a graphics team are logo now has a big all which looks like it's doing oversight I said\nHis recent report does address weighty issues like the government's use of the foreign intelligence Surveillance Act or fight so\nWe found that there were several deficiencies that had the potential to impact the protection of us person privacy\nHe also raised concerns about Internet searches that could jeopardize civil liberties however the details are only in the classified version of his report\nShortly after taking the job storage invited watchdog groups to the NSA one attendee niche Whelan block of the project on government oversight says this is George\n... I think he's a breath of fresh air over there but he predicts it will be hard to change the culture around whistle blowing\nThe fear of retaliation Israel I mean a lot of people don't want to even go to all that even if they could ultimately prevail many months or even in some cases years down the road it's just it's a it's\nIt's a nightmare Rob storage is undeterred\nI have a job to do independent oversight a completely independent\nAnd he's reminded of that every time he looks at the el on his wall Greg McGarry NPR News Fort Meade Maryland [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News for fifty years an archive in Nashville has meticulously recorded the national evening news [noise]\n\n\nIt now has so much footage of TV broadcasts that it would take nearly six and a half years to watch them all back to back so Emily signer from member station WBHM P.

Fox News\nIs all things considered from NPR News I'm also Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly did the Saudis murder ... that provocative question is the headline of a New Yorker article exploring\nWhat happened to crush again fifty nine year old Saudi dissident and journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in stumble a week ago today and was never seen walking out Robin Wright wrote that in\nShe is a long time chronicle or of the middle east who's been visiting Saudi Arabia since Nineteen eighty one and she joins me now Robin good to speak with you good to be with you [noise]\nLet me flip back on you that question that you posed in the New Yorker how real a possibility is it that Saudi Arabia murdered Saudi journalist democracy cookie\n[laughter] it's just stunning that there is no proof of life now in a week\nAnd that the Saudis have offered no explanation for what happened to him his fiance waited for eleven hours outside of the ... and finally because he left his cell phone behind with a warning to call authorities she did\nAnd that's where we stand and that's as little as we know today\nThe Saudis have offered a denial of any involvement the embassy here in Washington put out a statement calling or any claims of involvement outrageous and expressing concern for ... well being um it sounds as though you take those denials with a grain of salt\nWell I'm very struck by the fact you all had talked to me quite frequently over the past year about the threats he felt to his life even being in Washington DC\nYou've known him for decades I should mention I've known him for a long time and Jamal ... I've talked to him quoted often over the past year\nIn his growing criticism about the government effectively led by the crown prince Mohammed bin film on\nAnd he he told me in August that he was worried about the threat to his life and said that the kingdom would like to see him out of the picture as he put it I think he didn't realize how real that possibility would date or otherwise he would not have gone in to the consulate\nIn Istanbul yeah you're right that the mystery surrounding his disappearance fits into a broader pattern a trend of silencing dissent to me about that what's the pattern that you see\nThe pattern is a clamp down on activists even as the\nGovernment talks about reforms in modernizing society and opening up to whether it's women\nMore the young a social life and allowing movie theaters for the first time it's very striking that that ... just as it allowed women to drive also started picking up some of the biggest women activists one was recently been sentenced to death\nAnd one of the most striking things drum Oliver said to me\nWith quite recently when he said that the crown prince was totally autocratic and totally a liberal and that he was concerned not just for his own life but for others which had led him\nTo take a position he never thought he would remember this is a man who was a reluctant dissident he was someone who had supported the monarchy and still didn't principle it was the type of role and the the tactics\nOf the young crown prince that had led him to worry about his own life and to speak out for the first time after years of saying nothing on his own friends were\nArrested how far outside the realms of what is normal and Saudi Arabia are the crown princes tactics them in Saudi Arabia as you well know it's never claimed to be a liberal democracy\nLook there are many murders governments around the world and Saudi Arabia has arguably the most abysmal record on human rights of any country in the world but this kind of extra territorial action\nReally very unusual and a crackdown against someone who's not in Saudi Arabia crack down on people who shouldn't be the face of a new young person who claimed that he was a reformer really is very telling about the state of the kingdom\nThank you Robin thank you that's the New Yorkers Robin Wright speaking with us about the disappearance of Saudi writer and dissident ...\nIt's been a little more than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executives Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out\nTransformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any will training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places\nThe rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as new\nPeter shell ski toner shelters deli in Brooklyn\nI haven't heard about it until you can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy originally written down Sabbath on his radar he says he'll come fly you know will move your credit for all\nOf it and we're not used to serve me for because of course Frank\nKenya as a Rochester based human resources consultant his clients are small businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\n... estimates over half of the state small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he says prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including live trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from the clues about the training\nAnd the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is a New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nYou don't have training that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer knock during this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are to read about and\nPeople are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...
