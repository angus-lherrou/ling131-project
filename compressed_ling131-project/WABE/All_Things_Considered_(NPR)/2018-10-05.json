confirmation comes down\n... itself has this ... go look at the confirmation process and say what are we doing wrong here because I was like there's ... there's been heard who no matter how the vote comes out\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty six teams\nCan really do think that um ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was a fear Republicans told me they were afraid that the a poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play I I don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on\nThe other side that spurred by this sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president's ah with the comments that you played a I think that really ... the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly\nIt could I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be the functions will it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a

Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome\nIt's pleasure being with you and my right and thinking you were pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shipped\nI'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now can you create\nLikely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and her questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kevin ... should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs into the room and he should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that is his performance during the hearings draws me to change one way\nTo Americans so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to a bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him and his reputation as family that he would have acted like an all time to time I\nHad by the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nWhile I forward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice\nThat wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say it was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that she found the tactics\nSomewhat the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up or when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not faulted for responding to that\nIt will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota John Malcolm thank you [noise] it's good to be with you at the heritage foundation's John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many

has done even further damage\nIt's the latest symptom of an infection that's been present for some while we've had parties in the Senate almost from the very beginning but there have usually been at least a few conservatives in the liberal party liberals in the conservative party lots of moderates in between\nThe politics of the last quarter century however had been purging those crossovers and those moderates even those who now remains sounded increasingly like hardcore partisans\nAnd here's Sen Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina thought of at times in the past as something of a matter of brick somebody who could talk to both parties here he is at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a week ago addressing the Democrats across the room\nBoy tower got help you never get it of course Lindsey Graham is referring here to the mid term elections next month when Democrats had hoped to have at least an outside chance of getting back in the majority Lindsey Graham\nNew cameras were rolling then does language like that actually poisoned the kinds of relationships and interactions that you see behind closed doors or some of those just for formative\nWe should say there have always been occasions of heated rhetoric and angry words and especially from certain members at certain times but as you say\nThat collegial nature of the chamber and the long six year terms that they have and the need for certain ... arrangements in super majorities that they have to get that tended to bring people together\nBringing them into a more cooperative mode of operation but that can break down and that is what democratic leader Chuck Schumer was referring to this morning on the Senate floor when he concludes his argument for rejecting Kevin\nFor the sake of the center of the Supreme Court ended up America I Hope I pray my colleagues will do so\nWe've been talking about the impact this fight is having on the Senate what about the Supreme Court where if confirmed Kavanaugh might\nServe for decades do you think this will have a long term impact there it will be a burden on the members of the court who have proven remarkably good at times at least at ... their political differences within their larger relationship to each other and to the court and to the country and to the law\nNow that gets harder after a confirmation process such as this process that is stressed by the collision of major movements within the culture\nWithin the Supreme Court for years we've heard stories about justices with ideological differences having close friendships having a relationship that flourishes even though there might be on opposite sides of a political divide do you think this affects that kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are very different justice and yet quite close friends who would spend every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and so on\nThat kind of ... geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will make the court more visible\nDoesn't mean they have to come out from underneath those robes doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN or that they're going to stop their very small group conferences but it does mean that for many people the court has been identified as something different from what it was before\nNPR's Ron Elving is a

verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot in the quantum McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation and the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this is guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nLove because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described comic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um\nHe said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can shape looking at the dashcam video of this and that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald\nOr prevent that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shots six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I\nThink that that wasn't going to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon
