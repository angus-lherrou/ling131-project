immigration is the number one issue twenty three percent say job in the economy as and one just quick point on this immigration point immigration is not just about\nBuilding a wall and a GOP based but it's also become a proxy for jobs in the economy so you're heading to two birds with one stone if you're Donald tramp and you're talking about immigration to your ...\nOr ... if I asked you to push a ... a few weeks ago that we would be here inside of three weeks to the midterms and talking about a caravan would you would you have taken up at\nUm I should've been smart enough to take it because I think it's very clear that Donald Trump is still worried that his base\nIs not mobilized and I think it's very striking that immigration has not been working this year the way it may have worked for him and twenty sixty and a good example is the Senate race in Pennsylvania where a representative Lou Barletta really staunch full of immigration\nI'm afraid to be very nativist is running way behind Senator Bob Casey fourteen Boyd Seventeen boys\nAre in some of these polls so the issue isn't really sticking out there it seems that is true across a lot of the mid west and so Trump has to wrap it up uh with the caravan I think it's also worth saying important to say as my colleague Greg charge of the Washington Post water noted\nThat there are two big problems here with what Trump is doing his\nTrying to cast immigration as a fundamentally malicious and destructive force and that he could only be dealt with with toughness as to where he said that does work for the Republican base but does that were obviously it doesn't work for Democrats and assault or getting for independence either so at best is is a turnout move\nBefore we move on you were just out in Ohio talking to voters did

Illinois\nSo listening via W. H. B. E. dot org so if we have folks from Illinois calling in to support Atlanta's NPR station are we hearing from you\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they are all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\nI'm In\nA restaurant serving ... God as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could uh give the Republicans some\nWay to handle or home especially in Hispanic community is away Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon Baron owns a small business repairing floor is he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stand\nFor security for her you know you need certain order and in your home you know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall you think that's a good idea it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door and my door already have a door but I Would have better doors when you're ... air my son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nBut step outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seem to have been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party if you ask me\nI mean who sold and all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is no reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJews have Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters decide to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election but Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nAnd not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern seen it in the district state representative Tony Rivera [noise] have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say the other day um how could you be a\nRepublican when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics it off\nImmigration reform and there's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district se knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was on the river almost zero Republican running for realize I'm I'm here\nTo answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do a paper it doesn't look good on the news or does it look good\nThough one way no I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her Vero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one that Trump is ...\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still I asked\nYou see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a study to see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt was Diaz who approached do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for\nHe is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you get a boy you got ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nOr

A. she says she didn't see at the time we're all the puck marks underneath the make up when you hear Democrats cheering about it a plotting themselves are passing it if there's something a little bit impatient that well the inside of\nPatience is an excellent way to describe it and like I Am in patient because I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting\nWaiting for what for some sort of change some sort of champion maybe some ... some things would be amazing\n... says she doesn't know exactly what that fix should be but you know she wants to see Republicans and Democrats working together to come up with some compromise and she says this is the single most important issue for her in this entire mid term election\nAnd for more on how health care is playing out in Arizona's races we're now joined by kj ... Will Stone who covers health care\nThere Well hi Elsa so you know we see a lot of issue ads about healthcare throughout the state including one that jak genes started but what candidates actually saying about health care on the campaign trail Democrats are certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care\nAnd another referendum on the Affordable CARE Act\nThat voters can expect the GOP to do what they tried to do last year or repeal the healthcare law\nI'm In this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call more defensive posture\nUh it's very much on display in our tight Senate race between Democrats have been the defense of ones for the past eight years but you think it's Republicans now that is seems to be what's happening right now I mean if you just look at the race between Democrat gifted in cinema\nUm she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent Martha mix Sally and you know in response ... had to kind of soften moderate her stance on the issue saying we cannot go back to where we were before the CIA that we need to fix the law protects people with preexisting conditions\nAnd so for me I think it shows that to win a statewide race in Arizona\nWhich before the AC I had one of the highest rates in the country Republicans like make Sally need to reassure voters\nThat they support certain key provisions of the healthcare law and not just a full repeal so you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in the states not so much and you can see that you know in the political races and a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid\nArizona expanded Medicaid under the CIA and we had a lot of people who needed coverage so there was a big rush to joined the program\nThat was at risk under the GOP bill and people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program a Republican moderates like the program it functions well\nSo no one wanted to see that a damaged or cut\nAnd that's where those who shop for insurance plans on the market place they say they want more options cheaper plans lord a duck to bowls but they do not want to see a full overhaul yeah\nOn on more options you know we heard current body said she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month\nWhat does it look like I mean it looked like there will be more options for the state it's looking remarkably better of the market has stabilized at its rebounded\nHealth experts I talked to say it will be more options and it's really one of the more resilient are examples in the country of the marketplace it's working that kj these Will Stone thank you very much well thank you [noise]\nIs all things considered from NPR News\nAnd you're listening to all things considered on member supported Ninety point one W maybe we're a T o meets NPR I'm Jim Burress alongside Ayesha Hyman we need to hear from eighty seven more listeners to stay on track\nOn this final five o'clock hour of our pledge drive six Seventy five five three Ninety Ninety W.

and stress the importance of early voting which up and Monday\nBecause they\nThink they are\nOr what [noise]\nTwenty five percent say immigration as the number one issue twenty three percent say job in the economy as and one just quick point on this immigration point immigration is not just about\nBuilding all off in a GOP based but it's also become a proxy for jobs in the economy so you're heading to two birds with one stone if you're Donald tramp and you're talking about immigration to your ...\nOr ... if I asked you to push them back a few weeks ago that we would be here inside of three weeks to the midterms and talking about a caravan would you would you have taken up at\nUm I should have been smart enough to take it because I think it's very clear that Donald Trump is still worried that his base is not mobilized and I think it's very striking that immigration has not been working this year\nThe way it may have worked for him and twenty sixty and a good example is the Senate race in Pennsylvania where a representative Lou Barletta really staunch full of immigration\nI'm afraid to be very nativist is running way behind Senator Bob Casey fourteen point Seventeen points or in some of these polls so the issue isn't really sticking out there it seems that is true across a lot of the mid west\nAnd so Trump has to wrap it up uh with the caravan I think it's also worth saying important to say as my colleague Greg sergeant the Washington Post water noted\nThat there are two big problems here with what Trump is doing he is trying to cast immigration as a fundamentally malicious and destructive force and that he could only be dealt with with toughness\nOr as to where he said that does work for the Republican base but does that were obviously it doesn't work for Democrats in the south or getting for independence either so at best is is a turnout move\nBefore we move on you were just out in Ohio talking to voters did you see these things resonating there what\nWas really striking in Ohio and this goes across the Midwest in Michigan and in ... Wisconsin\nUm these are states where Trump made a lot of games and the Democrats are cutting bouncing back Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio is way ahead as a Democrat I'm Richard Cordray the Democrat running for governor isn't a very tight race a Democrats are doing quite well in Wisconsin and Michigan I think\nOn election night we're really going to learn a lot about how strong Trump's hold it is on these key states if those states goes south on Trump\nOr the whole operation is in a grave trouble and the Democrats are short doing better uh this year then people would have predicted two days after the twenty sixteen a like\nA Margaret would you agree with that Democrats doing a lot better than might have been predicted\n... well they are doing very well and it is likely that they'll take back the house of representatives you look at every single poll right now ah but you know\nIt kind of generic out the generic ballot average as Democrats leading Republicans by you know the low end eight percent to the high end fourteen percent so\nThat is at not historically a surprise uh it is typical for the president any new president to lose seats in the house of representatives and after that first at election cycle but they proportion any extent may actually end up being historic\nAll right let me turn your two totally different topic uh the case of Jim ... says of course the missing\nLikely murdered Saudi journalist a President Trump and just this afternoon said for the first time he's open to considering sanctions against Saudi Arabia's if it turns out that they were behind this but he continues to stress Saudi Arabia is a great ally of the U.S that we need to wait for an investigation which he says we may know more about by Monday\nMargaret why the reluctance to call out the Saudis\nYou know Donald Trump wants to have it both ways right he he wants to be able to put his arm around five um our president\nAnd say wouldn't it be great if we can all just get along with Russia they have no incentive to intervene in our election and then he also wants to be a tough guy on the world stage and ... ... ... ... it's it's very difficult to understand the reasoning or that the rhyme or reason behind this other than what's on their faces this was his first diplomatic play as a president\nStates his first international trip or a wide range of Saudi Arabia and he put his arms around Mohammed bin ...\nAt this says at\nFrankly it was encouraging I think to the secretary of the nation pull out of the Saudi Arabia and back then conference the treasury secretary who was all set to go to Saudi Arabia right at ... and and but then again you've got these mixed messages from the Trump Administration Rio secretary ...\nGoing to Saudi Arabia and hang out we're going to need more time what we really look too and hope for and I'm hopeful though so the Republican leadership in Congress also\nReinforcing this idea that a Saudi Arabia must not be allowed to get away with murder and American resident and a journalist\nA full\nFull stop alright EJ jump on that first up and I want to ask you about something that the Washington Post your newspaper was writing about today and it's a whisper campaign among the hard line Republicans conservative commentators\nAgainst cook ... um the the the ... that they seem to be highlighting his his association with Muslim Brotherhood in his youth\n[laughter] what's going on here well first of all it's disgusting uh and imagine someone saying spreading a stories like this about soccer officials and meats and the great ... you know Soviet there certainly are like ... I'm hauling and do anything you have to do on behalf of Donald Trump\nIt so the post ran his last stop bad written before he was killed\nAnd it was a defensive free speech it sounded almost red white and blue and how much it talked about the importance of free to many appears to have died\nA died for this cause\nI think all of this in terms of Trump or raises a question about the transparency of Trump and his business dealings there were so many questions now out there not only about Trump being invested in the Saudis in policy terms which clearly is\nAbout what kind of business dealings we have and we need to know about his um ... you know he didn't separate his businesses\nOf himself from his businesses when he became president we just need to know that because the suspicions that this might if his views on this might be influenced in any way by this this this is terrible for him and it's really terrible for the country\nAnd we should watch and see if the president says as these investigations play out and we wait to see what the White House might do next of duty on of the Washington Post on the workings institution and Margaret Hoover of PBS is firing line thanks so much to vote for it to be with you thank you\n[laughter]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm living in Marietta, Georgia on the Danish didn't work at very college so I drive from Mary Jerome and I'm very grateful for all great programming and the news and the objective way in which everything is ... particularly the news\nBut I go out to be a first hum a benefactor to NPR and give you a killer and appreciate the great work\nAt the same goes here to lead\nAnd Rufus thank you for leaving those comments and for becoming a new member we would like to welcome you as W E ... newest member on this the final day of our pledge drive and we are in the final minutes almost quite literally sixty five more people to do in the six o'clock hour as we wrap up\nOn this last day six Seventy five five three Ninety Ninety or W.
