S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Hi Jeff Hi Ari first of all what are these chemicals\nOr pee fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\nPee fast is also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers and the million\nHow harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are scientists will say pee fast is are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\n... chemicals have been linked to a wide range of the facts including cancer\nLow birth weight thyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects\nOn the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast and the U. S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals\nIt's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that is about Seventy grains of sand in an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher ... is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his need clear direction from the EPA and from policymakers\nTo be able to explain to the public at my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as\nPossible now the EPA is working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding differently to this\nAn issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage ... chemicals\nAnd we don't know what that plan is going to look like until it's out sometime in the next few months so what could people do to protect themselves today\nWith the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink if you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pictures those would bring the levels down too\nBut I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water\nThat's NPR's Jeff

best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message a tell us about it\nIt was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago um\nHe said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have pie TST how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you on deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh [noise] I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing except usually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some of misbehavior\nUh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among cancers generation of veterans I Can't or said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nIs NPR's Quil Lawrence ... thank you Ari\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is worth

fulltime part-time Thames and seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was under lemon dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of

that you're traveling with what kind of precautions are these members of the Indonesian Army taking in case people do try to seize supplies forcefully\nOh well certainly on this highway we are with what's known as the strategic commandos and their uh their whole breach is to secure this road mom and they don't want to break up the teams because they say they will be vulnerable to attack they're afraid that band did say you know there are prisoners were released\nFrom prison when they burned them down or otherwise and skates during the earthquake and there's fear that you know banned it and and what other inmates may have escaped will commandeer their rifles and so their\nOrders at any rate or to stay to gather what the brief is to try to secure this place um oh we are now in day for and you're sitting really see a deteriorating situation rather than in in ... and why is that things have been very slow to ramp up\nAre there other people traveling this highway besides military convoys\nOh there are some individuals yes\nOf course there are people going on up to the earthquake zone because people have not been able to have any contact with their family and many people are on accounted for so there is a race pick it up there and the race now is against time he gets through the day for\nAnd people will just you know the whole idea that people will survive after\nThis long

not anything is an awful loaded is another question altogether seats are more you can stream we slowly there was an imitation for international aid to come in but\nIt's very very difficult to get here\nWe've also been hearing reports that supplies are moving more to the city less to rural areas are you hearing stories confirming that that the supplies are being distributed quite unevenly\nWell there's a lot of anger about that but want is so huge and the preparation for this is simply nowhere near what needs to happen here\nThat's NPR's Julie McCarthy she's traveling in Indonesia central ... province thank you very much Julie thank you\nKnow to the Supreme Court where today the justices grappled with a difficult death penalty question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia but he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVern in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple\nSevere strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension his lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things about the state six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate sign himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to attain the punishment that the trial judge believe was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Nobel Prize in
