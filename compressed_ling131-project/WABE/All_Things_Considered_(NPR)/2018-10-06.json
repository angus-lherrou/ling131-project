Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage\nTo come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision can make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously\n... or ... showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and is a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before\nThe final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the

Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dashcam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life were

WB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believe Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting would climb McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat there's this one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are the people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWould just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke or the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something\nThe fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command the jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in ... report it on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released of this
