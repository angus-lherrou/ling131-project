NPR News I'm Shereen Marisol Meraji in Georgia\nAllegations of voter suppression or grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivist they're suing can't because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark ... he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program thanks for having me\nAll right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years\nTo um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law\nThat resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this law is disproportionately affecting minority voters how\nThey made that case you well it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters\nSeventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular with the nose and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can be running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to um be his opponents say that Brian ... is part of this process as secretary\nOf state who's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work is the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing\n... elections in enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just since the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is\nMotivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on\nVoting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp used\nThat was my ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank

couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's objectify women who is a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah and\nYou know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by my appearance and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me what\nIs forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags\nYou know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely the\nSpace that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show
