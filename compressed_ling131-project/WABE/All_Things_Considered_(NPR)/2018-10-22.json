you know\nOhio University is using this video dramatization you just show how ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose newly\nOhio University is one of many schools

bottles of ... sprayed all clearly labeled and read as opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our can in every norm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel this facts you would hold it like this the tip into the patients natural\nAbout regarding an inch down into the nasal passage when he was just

says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects during his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNews this is all things considered I Know the Chang and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump declared over the weekend that the U.S is pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed this treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nBut the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio coyote okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does this treaty actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know if this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's so provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan a Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and the administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei rehab cough was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U. S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remembered thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has a stockpile ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the administration might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and probably like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the ins with us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the thrust is mental\nLimit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again after all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting You're welcome Audi\nResidents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by hurricane Michael\nHas a snapshot of where they stand now twelve days after the storm about Seventy thousand customers remain without power\nSome water and sewer systems are not working and cell phone service is spotty a complete breakdown of communications during and after the storm crippled the emergency response and now it hinders recovery NPR's Debbie Elliott reports\nJim Melvin lives in ...

Christie's auction block Thursday maybe reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence\nIt's called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auction by such a prestigious art house now that is new\nArt appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you pleasure to be here I'll say how controversial is this in the art world for a ...\nThe painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we can set our art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel Just shop where he literally took them then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what art actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well\nThey still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere ... really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just outside of Washington DC thank you

interested in and if there was any role of genetics and this in criminology has been a no no er taboo subject for a long time\nBecause they can dangerously trend to the question of how race yes and he turned criminality\nIs so there were in recent years certainly since the ... of the human genome some scientist began to look at\nBehavioral genetics and there was a professor at Duke who is a criminologist and her work indentified several genes which could be precursors to impulsivity which is a characteristic of a lot of criminals\nBut she stresses that there's no such thing as a criminal

states routinely purge hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call use it or lose it laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nIt works like this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state send you

vote in the governor's race [noise]\nWe analyze all the people perjuring Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we

Abrams and other Democrats said there's a solution let people register all the way to election day\nAt least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nStates where you have same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate\nA bad idea ... how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on all that but if you don't know an October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of
