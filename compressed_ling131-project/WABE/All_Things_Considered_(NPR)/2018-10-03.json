Northam\nSo we're very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs\nThere's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before that finalized disagreement in\nThe end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost if they're still purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America and our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have is\nThe administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking

discovery nearby a cancer cluster of young kids all with the same rare deadly diagnoses lane was desperate to know for girls were risk so she started reading\nAnd from listen like you who donate to this NPR station and NPR News this is all\nThings considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro now we're going to hear from a friend and former classmate of judge Brett Kavanaugh who wrote a letter in support of the Supreme Court nominee in August and now says he has changed his mind\nMark all slur within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program they keep for having me when you think back to the late eighties when you when Kavanaugh were in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was an intense experience as a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience were both among the most intense of my life\nWas Kevin all like back in law school when you were students together\nWhen we're in law school a rat was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never and this is important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin all over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election and I'm certainly aware that\nBrett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I Would have chosen in that way and so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett\nThat he was somebody that I liked it but I called some people practice in front of that court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia\nAnd they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks in real good opinions and so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support I think\nIt really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr Ford given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government\nAnd having civil discourse with the quick quote branches of government is something that we have to expect from the Supreme Court\nIn particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy club which are wrecked Kevin uh started by recognizing his ah that he liked her that he had my work but then when she has to hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like a gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing no he did come back and apologize for that at least in center ... but that's something that is very hard to get over\nWhy do you consider that disqualify\nLike I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear irrigate the power to themselves and if he's going in with that kind of contempt ... equal branch it's deeply troubling\nI Know that you've been in touch with other classmates do you feel that your representative or more of an outlier\nI'm an outlier in two ways I mean I was outlier for signing the letter in the first place it was only twenty three out of the hundred and sixty some members of the class who signed it in the first place so that may be an outlier in certainly an outlier one with my Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise]\nUm so it's it's really only the two of us are among settled group who who did both things\nDo you still consider him a friend\nYes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect you might be screened in my calls right now but uh I Hope not mark\nAll sorts of Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor also now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department's internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose hail hail so so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children and border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSo then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nSo have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents\nOh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to central\nAmerica All right That's NPR's Joel Rose

considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how\nMany people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this and what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father [noise]\nSome women said\nI'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know it just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever made\nWe do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to this call him since it was published this week\n[laughter] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing the stories I was very moved by them because I never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon\nNot today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads\nThey're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking\nWas that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAt is causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Donald Trump has described himself for decades as a self made billionaire claiming to be built his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success with central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that's\n... is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler and the story reveal schemes the Trump family used to avoid gift and estate taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws\nRescue there is one of the reporters who wrote the story welcome to all things considered Thanks Ari\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred and Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns that related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we had general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one's sprawling article and I'd like to tell me about one of them\nYou write about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances and properties the Trump owned in practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all\nCounty looks like a company you know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper\nFred Trump had always negotiated personally the prices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety two bills for those items began being in voice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice it get the money and then they would create another in voice to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent\nLike pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then building Fred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split\nBetween Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners of our identity\nThat's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee Fred Trump's who was also and nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these building things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against is on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia\nDonald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by his creditors and he had some lawyers right up a caught us all a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this he just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and put the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump's sister who was then a federal judge and the lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or influence over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well we think that's nice\nTrue um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard it now says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so real estate\nCompanies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual as one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the ... side\nBut it seems to go beyond it yet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades to simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating at tort gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions along on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years for public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth than twenty sixteen but because Trump hasn't\nReleased his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well\nJim Zarroli NPR News New York [noise]\nAnd you're listening to all

breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with well you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states\nBut it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement so we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact on numbers\nAnd then the Jewish and there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind is ... burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost if they're still purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA is it an improvement just is worse\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have\nThe administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that
