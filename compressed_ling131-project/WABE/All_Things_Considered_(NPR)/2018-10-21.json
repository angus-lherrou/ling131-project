return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy four testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why when I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us one out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he's\nSmiling and then he starts to take her genes off\nMany he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other parts of the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bed but then you you left yet\nThis was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a she was laying on the bed and uh\nWhat one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou you know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article or you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece a sink struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk\nAnd you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody\nDid anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a\nQuote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder\nInstead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nYear old
