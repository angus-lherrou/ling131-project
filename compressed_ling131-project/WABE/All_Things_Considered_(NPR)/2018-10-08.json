and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy with Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what he was saying substantively is that the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations still with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an

named to China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude you know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a a rogue regime and one of the top threats to us security that that has to be dealt with harshly\nI really think that's the tone that China's reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China a because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's top stance

Chang mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party many presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and he knows it as NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything\n[noise] then\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a crime all over the place you're going to have people boring across the border you lose your rights to those guns you can ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it they want\nTo America in June meant as well ah\nThey really do even for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president lost a midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the sun is a catastrophe\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nHave you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved in the house the big the big problem will be the don't just have endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way that we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the been God's investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's are is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to talk to voters\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are re elected to the majority of ... of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to triangulate which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues but we're talking about a climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago\nAnd so do if the Democrats were to take control it would be you know an ugly this was not fun or\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did the Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says that should be summarily fired because clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallo says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like a real success these ... people were so like when there were three it's a there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\n... rolls his party like you're going to see them a lot less if they get their books he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprised me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nSteady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted there really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people got to really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause you still have this country than she did still launch it appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day\nAnd I always had that I had her mind from Italy exactly\nTaylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of a looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out and well she didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and in ...\nLine when she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today hey thank you\nAnd this is all things considered from NPR News\nJust two days before saxophonist and composer ... went into the studio to record his new album Hurricane Maria hit his native island of Puerto Rico\nDuring session breaks the known called family and friends for news about the devastation back home NPR's Michel ... says\nThe resulting album your soil onto this young or I Am the tradition has the MacArthur genius his trademark originality but the natural disaster also gives it emotional urgency\nMcGehee known had already planned for his eleventh album to shed light on Puerto Rico he's recorded many adaptations of the folk music in the past in this new eight parts sweet for saxophone and string quartet he showcases a different cultural tradition in each piece\nThis one Rosario is inspired by the rules are traditionally played on folk instruments at funerals and other occasions\nIt's always a soulful player but with the hurricane hitting so close to the session his performance here but the spectral cortex took on special feeling they play his adaptations intense rhythmic interaction\nAnd storing melodies as a fervent prayer\nIt was so interesting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just wide against black racism it's much more complicated right you're you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system that is taught at some time that system can be taught African Americans as well\nSo you have that version and then also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes is African Americans we have racism and buys on their side ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old do you think audiences are more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma\nUnfortunately yeah yeah yeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction fan anyway and I always knew I wanted to write a young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because so often victims in these cases are teenagers they're young people\nOn Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve\nAnd I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost um but I also knew that when adults pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl them a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence\nWho has so little experience you would literally witness this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nRider Angie Thomas and director of Georgetown and junior [laughter] their new movie is called the hate you give thank you both very much it was a real pleasure to talk to you guys thank you

Chang Philadelphia is getting closer to opening what maybe the country's first facility where people can use illegal opioids and other drugs all under medical supervision\nAnd nonprofit has foreign to launch the so called supervised injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump ministry officials are watching and promising crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell twelve hundred\nAnd Seventy Philadelphians of overdoses most of them died alone in the year twenty Seventy size re per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites that having done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\n... Rosenstein incorporate or of the safe injection site nonprofit an income interests me first\nRun del says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nRound the gold fine with the AIDS project in Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nIdea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relation\nShip of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit is already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria ... Sanchez is still on the\nReform via tire treatments components\nBefore we can talk about a safe injection site as a pool within\nOn a recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and drug bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes extra Delhi's leaning against our cars\nThis is how forty two year old ray describes reusing just his first name because he uses illegal opioids for a brand new ground zero ... man it's it's this crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts and has a Phillies baseball cap of ...\nHe says he'd go to the supervised injection sites 'cause right now he uses next door stuff it in our way back yard or anywhere\nElse officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors but one thing is clear they say if getting people like ray\nOff the streets and into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration so be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there was some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when illumination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nNews this is all things considered ... Chang\nWe're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food into us meant taking a calculated risk the country was growing people were moving into cities and industrialization gay food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products\nVery inventive was sacred back then because there were no rules against it right\nIt's completely legal to do whatever that's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro\nTalked with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking ... someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons\nOne dairy men seeking to sort of stretch their profits what\nSenate with water and it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which was pond water pond water pond water and and and there was a notice when the family found worms wiggling and the bombs\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would send them out you had to reconstituted in all kinds of weird why it's been what shocked us that people were plastered ...\nThey look we're a coal tar dies and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab to kind of make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish blue Russian then because it was prone to rot this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives and it and the most popular one was formaldehyde and which is an embalming compound which is not good for humans to ingest no and so you actually go out and can sing newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk\nScandals so along comes to protecting us to your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue [noise]\nI always thought of him as kind of a how holy roller ... of Harvey Washington while he was the son of itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry and the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture I mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the department of agriculture was it an food safety he took up that cause\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from project to tamper took it really shows his commitment to this ah described the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad was that three three meals a day seven days away super fancy meals are cooked by a professional\nChef all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree that half\nOf you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nDoesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry had\nIn organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments once that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out Salah ... acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out dry you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compounds\nIn this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused than even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book
