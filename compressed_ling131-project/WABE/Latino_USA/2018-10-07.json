students who are learning to drive forklifts and how to organize inventory in order to prepare them from working in warehouses\nNow our producers of yet buddies that car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses is Amazon's\nEvery shot to them to see if I can come take a\nCorrect and\nAnd visiting the facility\nGave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the Congress corrupt especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears justice to wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway and there are signs everywhere that say no photo\nOnce a guard like me and I realized the springtime tons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners bad\nJust under ... million for me [noise]\nUh we also in way more than a hundred full time with it [noise]\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise ...\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground\nLike wrote which is good because\nI'm going to\nThat actually though ... says\nWe will see another one in a minute we call them Avi A.\nG. these automatic guided vehicles\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with them but it's totally unmanned and it follows a map of the warehouse score programmed into it\nIt just wishes bias no problem\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray\nFor another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as an ally but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLent chewed up communications for Amazon they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room but they're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelf which holds item\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line once they do that that's when the item gets ...\nNotice on the screen provided the item I just said I Am [noise]\nAnd then one idiom how many they need to\nPick back massager\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow track\nKind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt\nThat an acceptable process in place that we're going to go and\nStation it's what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on the yellow tray and the worker accepted into box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can tell us\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about Greece so\nYou could do that we were ... hours a day workers\nNormally do for ... so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nThe very last thing that happens here back massager is that it gets a shipping lately all of the labor at this point is done by a magical\nPuff of air\nA shipping label is created and generally play it live up to err on top of the\nSound you hear them talk on the air that is placing it on to the shipping this hard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\nSo the robot for Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I find that my mother's room and there are vending machine\nThat I see two they're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says these figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nSo right after the incident we reached out to an ... cheetah she's a Colombian immigrants who runs a national nonprofit organization called the center for popular democracy and in our conversation we learned that a ... he had she had actually been preparing for that moment for most of her life\nI on ... welcome to let us say thank you so much\nSo I'm September twenty eighth you made a road of the line actually who to target Senator Flake and as a result of that you made a a narrative road that nobody could have imagined\nSo the story of friday begins many months ago the Trump election I think just created a sense of kind of unveiling of\nThe ugly underbelly of the country my organization the center for popular democracy which is a network of community organizations had been training people across the country for months and these tactics that we called bird doggy burn docking burn jogging\n[noise]\nWhat it's [laughter] bird dog and pony is the name of the ... topic where did you just for its human interaction with an elected official [noise]\nYou just show up at their offices and you say hey I'm here I Want to talk to you right now I Know you're there\nLet me tell you my story right now and you learned how to do this somebody a colleague of mine Jennifer ... she's the one who taught me about or jogging and she went across the country training people she sent emails to her friends and said\nYou can put Fifteen people in a room I Will come to you and train you on bird talking tactics and civil disobedience\nDo you remember the the thing that you remember the most that impacted you when you first experienced burn dogging\nA colleague of his name is Eddie bark and he was diagnosed with Alice and he went to D.C for the first time to fight the tax bill to tell his story when I was flying back home to Santa Barbara where he lived he bumped into Senator Jeff flake on a plane\nAnd the bird dog Senator Flake in that point\nFor water for one of our ... was\nHer her farm and for her and\nTold him that Senator Flake I Am dying of al is if you vote for the tax bill you will take away my disability payments you will take away my health care and I will not be able to be around for my son to grow up\nI Need you to be a hero in that\nMoment that interaction went viral\nEx gas made headlines when he can front of the Republican senator on an airplane about the upcoming vote on the latest version of his Republican tax bill\nAnd thousands of people than began to follow IDs debt and come to Washington DC to fight to tax\nWithout giving break there have been more than ... demonstrations already targeting Republican lawmakers\nMany of those people came back to join the members of United we dream to fight for\nThat and also known as dreamers protestors from the ceiling Shannon across Pennsylvania street linking arms out fine Senator Joe Donnelly the office like you see\nMany of them came back to join the women's march\nOrganizers were just hoping to get about two hundred thousand but you've got more than two hundred thousand\nTo fight against the separation of children at the border and many of these folks have been in Washington DC the last several weeks bird dog and members of Congress following their senators to try to force him person interactions with them and to tell them their stories\nAnd so that's how I ended up in D.C these week and I'm sure that there are people are saying I'm hearing burned out again and I'm feeling uncomfortable is it about confronting jumping taking on being confrontational\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\n\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it\nAnd he said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do with that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that we are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that\nBoys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listen to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized\nOh my God maybe my father will hear it this way maybe my mother would hear these way [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nIt didn't reach them but then on friday I texted made that\nInteraction with flake and they said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and he said to him it was not your fault and it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed\nI didn't tell my story because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women I I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how do those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate\nMe being a woman from being let me now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now\nAccepting and embracing these other part of my identity as a survivor I think the history of these countries the history of\nThe struggle for inclusion of morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act\nOf bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act\nIn some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nYeah I think it was the mother and me honestly that came out there is a quote by a seat activist Valerie ... so the mother and meet asks why didn't\nLet him leave darkness is not the darkness of the two of them but the darkness of the ...\nWedding America is not dead but a country waiting to be bar what does the midwife say she says when we are in labor cheeses breeze\nAnd
