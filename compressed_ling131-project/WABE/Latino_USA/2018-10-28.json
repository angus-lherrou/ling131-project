of Congress and the sound of a male female making [noise]\nI've been positive in that like the nicks people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah that's right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about\nUm [noise] that notion [noise] to be\nPhoenix or to be like the\n... year our identity [noise] is the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that I Know that I Am African [noise] I Am indigenous\nI Am also a product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to champion the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote\nMexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people [noise]\nAnd this is their land where your mom and\nDad [noise] speaking to you and saying that looks on their meter ... he was proud of being a war was a message like look on Sunday or you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nYou know I was I grew up with a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense of who we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and\nSo I grew up like the music I grew up around was Hector level ... cruise and then hip hop in you know growing up around the\nBrand your favorite hip hop artist would be a boy\nSo hard I grew up around my public enemy and not as Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat ... a big ...\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is do intersection off and to me it's not even that we're trying it's this is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was my dad\nWill go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah do you mean like for the weekend all I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where we went on family ... she cried\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg I'm going to see all that [laughter]\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know start like you're walking around member of Congress drink me with you know I'm an at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress I think I'm Still\nProcessing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been at the process\nBut I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of political ideas of twenty teens\nAnd she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... lives in Ireland\nBut we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like\nI had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nThat may be resist or an interesting question how are you managing your ego [noise] 'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and\nAll of that but at the same time it's also lonely [noise]\nIt is and if anything the there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the six dreams of terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nTo be pleasing and nice and sweet and polite and all of that and I'm not always that way you know and why aren't we allowed to be angry and to be fun to be a human being and it's just\nIt's frustrating and ... for trade a docile and fly it and yeah and who is not that way um she pushes against everybody she doesn't like anyone telling her what to do [noise]\nThis book when you were trying to get it published\nIt was rejected buying some agents because uh because what they didn't like the tone of the main characters\nI didn't like her voice and I said to myself well that's the most\nPart so I'm not saying you know and I took that as you know we were telling me that they didn't like the fact that this was a complicated strong Latina character I remember one rejection\nReally was upsetting for me and I cried because it was really mean spirited\nAnd I just really upset I felt really discourage but again I felt like I didn't need to change the voice because I felt like that that's what made it special\nAnd so I just held out until I found someone who believed it and finally I did find an amazing agent who's been wonderful to me it all worked out so\nI think that's just a lesson for young women to just kind of stick to your guns and if you believe in something someone else was going to believe in it to\nA year has passed since the publication of their book and I'm a follower of years on Instagram and so I was watching as like you know suddenly Erica Sanchez the poet has a novel and it's like constant smiles and you're getting recognition and it's just like\nOh yeah definitely two thousand and Seventeen was just wonderful like so many amazing things happened I was on the New York times list et cetera and it was just a magical time [noise]\nTwo dogs any team came around and [noise]\nEverything seemed to fall apart for me\nA really really tough depression started early in the year and it lasted about six months [noise]\nThe most challenging time with my entire life\nAnd so how all these like wonderful things happen and all of a sudden [noise]\nI don't know everything just kind of\nAnd then all of a sudden you actually put on your Instagram ... tell us what\nI wanted to be open about my struggle\nIt appears as if everything is magical for me\nUm but that's not really the keys you know even though I Am incredibly successful unlike very grateful for that I still struggle with mental illness like success doesn't cure depression and so I went through this really dark time and I just wanted people to know that\nThis happens and um that it's OK to ask for help and that it's okay if you're not okay and so yeah I Know a lot of really beautiful responses to that I think people really appreciate vulnerability and I also talked about my recovery because I wanted people to know that it's possible\nTo to overcome issues like this it's it's possible to I don't think ... beat depression necessarily but to to live with it and to address it so\nWhat are you trying to tell the young at well anyone who reads the book\nBut especially young Latinas\nYou know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino was dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life\nWhat do you say to them I Want to know that I see them that I get it you know I Want them to fuel understood\nAnd that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way and you know I had a son that season it was and I adored her but like that was it didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's a\nKey to be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect\nBoth in\nSociety and was in her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that\nI Know that they exist [noise]\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\nThank you for putting it into words Erica Sanchez we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate
