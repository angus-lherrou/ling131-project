spokeswoman for I says its use of federal prisons with a temporary measure Steven manning is an immigration attorney and represents the three remaining ice detainees\nIt was an abject failure of government policy to use the federal prisons Tom Ford the detention of asylum seekers\nMany of the detainees sent to prison or seeking asylum and weren't facing criminal charges that have been released on bail others deported or sent a private detention facilities around PR News I'm Conrad Wilson in Portland\nMajor league baseball's World Series was sent Los Angeles Dodgers won the national

another and and stay the course says a lot about a focus the toughness of of this team\nAnd ... that's why today many people feel a Democrat doesn't have a chance\nBecause Texas has been deep red for over Twenty years there have been challengers though Wendy Davis gave it a good shot she was a democratic Texas senator who became famous after nearly a half a day filibuster to block an anti abortion bill that\nStates that are that everyone is talking about Wendy Davis a Democrat took a stand against the bill restricting abortion in the state of\nShe ran for governor in last election cycle and lost to governor Abbott twenty point margin\nRight so if a democratic Darlene like Wendy Davis couldn't win in the state of Texas would really are the chances for sure about this well\nRemember she be seven people make it to the run off and she won in the run off though\nWe are um uh were consistent in victory\nFact even ... for sheriff of Dallas she was also the underdog but she won and won again\nFour times in a row\nTrack record of of breaking barriers and shattering glass ceiling and\nSome analysts say Texas really could turn blue state is getting younger and Browder Latinos are expected to become the majority of Texans by twenty twenty two and while Latinos in Texas are a little more conservative than elsewhere in the nation they tend to favor Democrats\nIn fact some experts argue and the next presidential election Texas will be a toss up state [noise] and so all this brings us to one of the sheriff's biggest talking points\nTexas is not a red state it's a non voting state\nIf the people would vote we would when\nShe's right about the non voting part the seat has one of the lowest voter participation rates in the country and many of those non voters are Latinos\nTexas has the second largest eligible population of Latino voters nationally you'd only twenty seven percent say they will absolutely vote in the mid term election compared to sixty five percent for non Hispanic whites\nAnd for the sheriff to when she needs to get Latino voters out to the polls especially first time Latino voters and she thinks she can do it\nIf you give them something to vote for something they identify with there's a bitter possible as it they'll come on to her\nAnd she's even going around registering Latino voters\nOne at a time [noise] [noise] right and we saw this for ourselves and we stopped along I tend to get gas and the sheriff started chatting up the cashier or you are you a whole\nUses the cashiers name is your chest seats are meeting when when\nIt turns out she's an unregistered potentially ... or send it in there now\nSo maybe a plus one for the sheriff well you know every vote counts right right so after this we happen the car pets in the next campaign event you stopped for lunch child\nGo through an immigration checkpoint or yeah how's\nYour day is that\nAn arrive at the Mexican restaurant in Odessa\nCameras and reporters are waiting for the sheriff when we arrive\nEvery day Texans are struggling\nMostly she talks about economic issues things like college affordability and healthcare and she often brings up her own background as a child of poor migrant workers to help her message resonate\nI Know what it is to try and decide between\nWe step away and start chatting with some of the people who are at the event we walk over to an elderly trio and I asked them why do they like sure about that\nShe has a lot of great cloud\nWomen can you think\nThis is John Hurt she's here with her friend Marian ... they're both lifelong Democrats and the seventies and eighties and like to share as they tell us there's more Democrats in Texas than you might think\nAnd they share a laugh with her about\nThis so they're coming out of the call\nAnd they'll say like wow I didn't know there was more Democrats\nBut it was a little surprising to find that in a predominantly let me know city like Odessa I mean that the people who came out to support her or the longtime older white Democrat not the first time Latino voters she needs to turn out\nIf she wants to win and at her next campaign event this problem seems to get worse

Texas and we were with her on the campaign trail\nAnd after stopping in Odessa we drove about an hour northeast to Howard College in big spring Texas and other majority Latino city\nWe walk into a they're conditioned room at the college and we wait for the Howard county Democrats to announce that sure about this is their guest\nArmy but after lifting off her credentials the sheriff isn't really paying attention instead she leans over to us and points to a guy in the corner\nWith a camera crew and that\nThat's my great haven't tried to me like Greg Abbott and race to Tripoli everywhere I go to take my first people started to one of\nThe cuts just will not that we're we're Democrats these\nHigh suddenly she called up to the stage she's caught a little bit off guard as she adds up to the podium and we're watching her walk up and then we kind of get a chance\nTo look at who is in the room right so if up until this point it seems like Lupe Valdez is the candidate who has what it takes to deliver taxes to the Democrats the candidate who is of the people and for the people law enforcement algae be teach you peel the working class\nWell this is where that notion hits a bump in the road there's about thirty five people in the room or in and we noticed that potentially devastating campaign for young people specifically lack thereof\n[laughter] I'm I'm\nNot really sure we're trying to get 'em out this is the Nazis narrows the Howard county democratic chair and looking around the room there are no young people here at all and we're at a college there are students everywhere school is in session\nThere's actually a roomful of college students next door to us in the cafeteria eating lunch I don't\nThink they're going to turn out as much as the older individuals I mean I think that's kind of our problem is how do we get them to turn now\nAnd I'm really not sure what the answer is or what the ... [noise]\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this September Quinnipiac poll has sheriff felt that his favorability rating among young people ten points lower than governor addicts\nYounger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas are ages Eighteen to twenty nine that's a large portion of Latino voters in a state where the Latino vote these cheat [noise]\nBut here we are out of college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and let the nuts and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for this particular\nFrom young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the share it's less than half a million\nOr he is a person that just has a very extreme ideas about the way boating should work who should be able to vote and I realize that the vast majority of his views on voting stem from his views on immigration\nIt's a no brainer if you really want to create jobs for Americans we need to start aggressively invalid racial laws and looking after our own citizens first\n\nSo tell us a little bit about Kris Kobach and his background like where is it that he started getting these hard line views on immigration\nKris Kobach grew up in Topeka he was valedictorian of high school class and\nWent to Harvard and while he was at Harvard she studied under a professor\nWho had a very extreme ideas on democracy I'm going to take a wild guess and say that that professor Samuel Huntington it is Samuel Huntington\nHe thinks that I think he calls it the Latino is Asian of America and he says that that's going to lead to like a downfall of American culture and that person was Chris Cox mentor at Harvard so how does it happen\nWhen you're looking into the background of Kris Kobach that you start making some connections around anti immigrant theoretical issues and Kris Kobach actually making money off of some of the policies that he ends up basically creating supporting\nRight so his first real job with government was after George Will be Bush got elected he joined the department of justice\nAnd so he leaves the deejay and goes to work for a immigration\nGroup called the federation for American immigration reform that would be fair fair which is a very extreme group that advocates for limits on immigration and for radical alterations to refugee policy is among other things maybe it's time to faze down immigration\nAs we can phase Americans\nBack before by origin for American immigration reform\nAnd so he went to work for them as an attorney but he\nLeaves their to become secretary of state for Kansas site during this whole time he is also trying cases across the country for towns shoe one very radical immigration ordinances for their individual town\nElection day was a victory and farmers friends for supporters of ordinance winning I Know a lot of us are responsible tenants US citizenship\nHazel ten Pennsylvania farmers branch taxes Fremont, Nebraska and Sally park Missouri\nToday anyone renting a house or apartment in Fremont must pay five dollars for an occupying the apartments and\nPeople in the country legally can get one people are moving out and packing\nUp and leaving and and uh it's having the desired effect we wanted to have\nUsually the ordinances were already on the books and he helped them refine them and then defend them in court once they were ... we have traced back all of the money that these cities directly paid Kris Kobach as a lawyer has a lawyer so over a decade we know that he made at least eight hundred thousand dollars\n[noise]\nThese are all small towns whose demographics we're shifting and in some cases not even for real like in a valley park Missouri they I think that's been population went from like one to three percent and that was enough to create this anti immigration sentiment\nWhat Kris Kobach dead in the opinion of the local people that we've talked to there who ended up ... paying person to work with capitalize on that existing sentiment\n\nFor example in valley park do not technically was\nChampioned like it like he he technically wanting valley park and it's like very narrow way\nSo lawn mowing parks it's technically on the books but the people who are there have told us one they've never enforce it and two they regret doing it\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch and went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence and use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have really benefited from this is Kris Kobach so if you think now about\nYou know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump in the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing it's hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes\nThen [noise] I think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just messed up [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nJust because they do so much for all of your reporting in
