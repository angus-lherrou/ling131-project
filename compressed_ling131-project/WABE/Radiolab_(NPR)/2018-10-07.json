Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before then say something high\n[laughter] [laughter] okay I think is good right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire and they arrive in Paris than double John Ritter and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a\nIs a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYou know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody's tracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors\nThought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years or so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved\nMassive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink ... been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages\nI have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've\nGot um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county Boca Raton Boynton Beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nBasically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise] so we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise]\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will also linked to hear from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nBy just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic tables\nMine just a high on that will make not one\nNo no no comment which is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was wondering for early don't you just described for me what we got on the cable 'cause I'm just going to have you had to work on the table right so I think you have to have you have to have on you\nYou've got to ask you got your grip and you've got to make it you've got your thoughts you got everything you want to have to get nice good old are they\nGoing to get him a show in Geneva reveal I'm the mother Sandra Bland and keeps you don't remember [noise]\nTry to do the research opposite ends\nSeen her plan is pulled over in a small town in Texas\nRuns or information comes back to the car for not your cigarette please\nOur law you don't have it right out of the car and I have the right way to do that I Do have the right now\nI Will remove get her move for a man out for our movie I'm giving you a lawful order for you know\nIt's\nLike you know mentally senior teeth out of the car but you know you don't often get it over\nYou know\nNot much\nSandra was eventually taken in jail for days later in that jail cell she was found\nDead hang with the plastic garbage bag the death Israel the suicide and centers family disputed that ruling [noise]\nYou've got everything you want to have to get nice good old are they\nGoing to get him a show in Geneva Greenville I'm the mother Sandra\n... coming from I ... I Want to let you or your food I one thing I wanted to have to have you come to come to like this before Oh yes sir quite a few\nOf in Missouri last week we go all around we tried to what many mothers and we can because it's important that exactly like that what it is it really just like us more Yes sir it's like because that mother who had lost their baby\nNeeds to be able to see somebody else looks like them in the same situation that they are as someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about something then and I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talked to these women\nEat the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody a cancer of lost a friend that cancer recently Amtrak\nIs a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it in a way because it's every day is another insults greater rate\nThan if I'm having to get in the script brown somebody\nSomething happened in you know here in Florida\nWe said in the lives of the club that\nThe family more than just\nRight\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys just have to every every event or no no I just wanted to know the ones on there and has been telling everyone about them\nAs being a joke to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but big in this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping remind me right now we're all just simply trying to find our way because\nIt personal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age as there and going because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage\nHand okay yeah 'cause I didn't want to do like your house like a like a like some\nOf that I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she said page comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house into wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight of how\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know a mattress if it becomes like a huge sleep over in reverse look worn asleep for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other you know ... or the vice children with like therapy for\n... let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... ... to\nMinutes when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that is really\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police started came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called extradition and the vegetables are close to the guardian was here in\nAnd all that\nBut I I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and papers that we came back here is all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association Michael went unpaid onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in\nYour time to any brings you right back yeah mhm [noise]\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\nThose either ... some of the other one that started to cry\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find to be a lot of what about let me a couple of women enemy their phones man\n\nThen it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight days\nAt three two one\nThree two one\nWe all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nAnd you know [noise]\nI mean we have we have an eye on\nIt was up to the fight we wrote a muscle beach and I and I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember at the end I used to tell ya how do you live so far away from him\nAnd I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people at a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved ... jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the side plate the weapon\nNot on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you would have thought it was Armageddon oh my God they're gonna get killed on reality what he did was it slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blink of an I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your not shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been\nThe color of my glass coming out my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that she would come back to again and again is this idea of time in certain situations slow down\nWhen you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do you've covered just creates in space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life in somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found this out also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some ... cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because there was there was this the text allowed\nThat's only know how to communicate is like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and ... and I'm Serious about whether the drive through McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nAnd in fact been told me that he touch it and police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which the problem because when they get into a fight their hearts stretch the race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on your nose and you know so that then says that that's why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bounces or for ... what he said from just\nMy little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the\nPolicy basically you know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff but we they bought Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day\nYou have to get to know people yeah for sure and so to make this point to where it got up walked me down the hall to another office had sent me down on the computer is the sound comes a point\nShow me the video to video starts\nIn silence and its body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as your side is his partner both cuts are white also it's night so [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife trying to stop people whose office maids if he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly park flow neighborhoods street and you can see down the street and walk away from\nThis shirtless black guy engine show out there\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop were in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty negative than any walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body chemicals out the taste of the other officers out it was as afraid as behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching a protein\nHe gets within like ... to the cops and then\n\nThe guy with a buddy him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then he\nChanged central four cups and then they\nMay not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the ...\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot above you get shot and I say if you want to die if you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nA fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what ... is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers when the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the point to eat at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first worn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\nTo\nActually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood that I mentioned on the front step waves of ... what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close came to be in that ... wouldn't be backwards mitigation ... wasn't doing drugs they was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nYou know again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just ... his militia ...\nShe would was elected sheriff ... county\n[noise]\nReally which is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with belongs his organization called her which is the grease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some being law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after per put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively\nIt does I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read just realized how far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont
