reporter Johnny Kauffman we spent months investigating voting in Georgia and you can hear our story tomorrow evening during all things considered\nWhere you're writing\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio from there'll be you and why [noise]\nAmjad I've I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that over don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well as it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make you wanna yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at her so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook and [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there or you didn't work either this\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer and\nWhat are you calling from St Louis nursing\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small peaceful\nProtest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook one of the\nOpening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs buster day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them\n\nViolence against ...\nAnd say and what we can't say that again but I'm just like ... what we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids are crossing the\n\n\nThank you Mr Cameron and Mr sack\nOf arc I got to ask you do you use them jak differently prioritize or sensors ...\nCongresswoman or we don't [noise] think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nOf ... what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these roles how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law so\nCommon law is the system dating back to early England where individual judges would make a ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges some the body of law was sort of constantly fleshed out and say Seventy facts [noise]\nLiterally every time this team that Facebook would would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight plop some things are going to show up that they that they weren't prepared for that sets a rule had an account\nOr as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about\nThis for example sometime around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nThat are jak [noise] that [noise] ... [noise] except\nAnd she comes upon this image\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressing skin breastfeeding\nA baby goats and the moderator throws your hands up and says ... what is this and we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice according to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought\nA known way to help your herd get through the drought is to ah if you if you have a woman who's ...\nTo have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human get ... and so there's nothing sexual about it's just good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant\nIt it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue there but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but but obviously\nBreastfeeding as we intended anyway meant human infants and so in that moment what they decide to do is uh remove the photo and there was an amendment and asked strict under the rules stating animals are not babies we added that so in any future cases people would know what to do\nWith it but they removed that they were they did was I was culturally appropriate and the thing that people do and they decided to remove the photo young that outraged individuals are editors foreign wheeler\nWhy why did we make an exception because because when it probably grows large enough you have to change the rules if not we don't this was not one of those cases the juice wasn't worth the squeeze\nAnd like if they were to allow this picture then they'd have to make some rule about when it was okay to breastfeed an animal and when it wasn't okay\nThis is a utilitarian document it's not about being right a hundred percent of the time it's about being able to execute effectively\nIn other words we're not trying to be perfect here and we're not even necessarily trying to be one hundred percent just or fair we're just trying to make something that works [noise]\nOne two three four five six seven eight and when you step back and look at what Facebook has become like for two thousand eight to now in just ten years\nI mean I'm\nSinger power came in LA and an\nIdea of a single set of rules that works that can be applied fairly nice gesture crazy crazy concepts\nBecause they've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to the\n... campaign would say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere is a lawyer in the ... case but as far as just content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora ... as well as\nI mean I Would guess that they're building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where the guys are just so used to treat everybody fever English and we\nSent them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on their screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\nWell what else can\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nA lot about the good work advice [laughter] so now I Am I search by these you know I'm Sorry she worked in\nI Know your life in fact most people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to me do\nYou want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that is totally fine you know it's going to end victory I don't want to hear\nExplained that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they work for face\nThey're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract flew about ...\nMind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I knew I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nCan I just I just like what he's high ... every day it was just ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case yeah he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just the ... um it's two at age ... X rated\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl uh having sex with an eight year old boy it's not just what it was like\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and not as you did did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it came up at night I\nCatch myself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat were very specific I couldn't watch it was widely cases like ... ... S C I was like okay I ... I have to walk away\nAnd I just have to I I chose to real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around\nPlaying cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting better automate that they yeah they uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes to me is hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back I think we should\nHi this is Jenny calling from Lima peru radiolab is supported by transfer why an online service that let people send and receive money internationally and their border let's think countless customers Holden convert currencies anytime\nMore transfer wise dot com and the\nShame that from a Hindi now wait in line he supported my target presenting theater at heart pod casting change makers and the project third time getting in communities nationwide future and high level on apple bought ... found [laughter]\n\nTo radio lab on Ninety point one W. A. B. E. Atlanta thank you for joining us today what's going to have some nice weather too We're looking at a mostly sunny today and low sixties low forties tonight that'll be the same over the next few days actually this is not important one\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but\nDespite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic effort to eliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech\nMakes sense well yeah because in sort of hate speech or are thinking about hate speech there's this idea of of privileged or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups should have more protection a because of\nBeing historically disadvantaged ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nYou Japanese reinforced in the Nineteen forties cut off the side\nYou had Japanese soldiers tens of thousands of Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two\nAt the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand persons of Japanese ancestry fall\nBeing put into internment camps and so we had to ask ourselves a question like are the Japanese and historically advantage or disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story in this happened\nAt the exact same moment so you've got to different places to different cultural stories in ... when you have a Web sites like Facebook this trans National Community they realized what they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to a ... way and consider who is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here American these moderators only have like four or five seconds ... Republican not come to make a decision\nA limited and the young men being in the news in those four seconds is there enough time to to figure out where in the world someone is particularly given\nIP address is can easily be mass go back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity white children are better than black children on top\nWe often don't know an individual's race straight people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did alive cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for viewers to implement a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nAnd converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses that that\nUm that's the tension here [noise]\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently but it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white\nRule [noise]\nWhen we come back those rules\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about flown at W.
