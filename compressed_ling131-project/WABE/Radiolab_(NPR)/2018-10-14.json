N. Y. [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's time now to practice some very useful phrase is I'll say the first year repeat I remembered and could gather let's forget\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin\nWe'll have five experiments in translation trench creation\nLesson number one the best was by my mother got got a few people know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug hostile professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty\nOne I was taking a French literature class on one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little about the kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage ... ah you know free syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that are still not\nBy heart diplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at\nThe court of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first yeah okay it's called\nA ... done was that in my lab to a\nSick demos ... so to speak to young lady of the young lady mommy none of us who doesn't look ... through ... ... ... ... to beat them all ...\n... the onto the boost used to ... to ... to ... to ... ... ...\nTo ... the bone I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... and [noise]\nOkay so you read the bone files it away deepen the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have a translate into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day\nThat home popped into his mind and I said\nThere is a challenge\nWhat is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy none has done\nLittle bones and if you just focus on the words of basically just this guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam feet you so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped ... or ... you know it's sort of like get better here's to your good health\n... to ... I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted in us and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a B. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean you just sort of has the feel of a ...\nIt has the poets name in the middle of the poems in on the mound when I did I say three syllables per lawyer you didn't or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast fee on to the top ... like this land that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their\nCan instead of squirming in your head of slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad on and on and I came up with\nWhen Syria to say ... you're in a serious like okay All right all us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this word serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern it actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nFor serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bride oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um [noise]\nBut the story that I Want to tell you as\nGood afternoon everybody um\nTo to be back in Africa Secretary Kerry or this out of his ... and city of enormous energy and the few\nDays before carry visit Ninety journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with my foreign minister counterparts and Secretary Kerry was giving his press conference I shared my concerns about a\nYoung Ethiopian blogger that I met last year a ... who ah with age of his peers have been in prison\nAnd I firmly believe that the work of journalists whether it's ... journalists are in the Internet or media of other kinds it makes societies stronger\nYou know he said all the things that he's expecting to say said we believe that free speech and open dialogues important to the economic development of country buffet blah but\nWe remain committed to our partnership with Ethiopia\nWith his comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise be up yet and\nI'd be delighted to answer your questions I'm not sure how that's going to do that\nThen came time for questions he took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists to more from the traveling press and to carry credit you know\nGive us John I Want to give them a shot I Know he was very impatient\nSort of before he left the party and he was like you know what we're just going to try something different we are going to like call on an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure we get a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second row as a young guy in his twenties boyish face wearing a moustache I've only two questions flu set\nI may have invited artist question of the day but one question or enough focus\nSo let me she was a ... of raised double ... nothing is a liquor\nWho's ... in these fringe is there a month and then this guy's like well\nEvery time a journalist is arrested us just a statement about this by these things out of this keep happening every piece of repeating Lydia much so then he asked this question ... seriously\n... it's just lip service or are you seriously concerned [noise]\nAt this point everybody is just not looking to carry they're all looking at the journalists who obviously had to take considerable personal risks in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station the this guy's on camera asking is extremely sensitive question about the Iranian journalist ...\nWe really ... him on January ...\n...\nAnd ... and looks at him like well [noise]\nYou've got to be kidding what I stand up and like and I and I and I say something um I I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and yeah so so remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably on Lincoln financial transactions and so what this journalist is saying is you are you just knew ... London or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you to be a who is withdrawing eight or with strong support in Terry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what do you accusing me of not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties use an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I sound like some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space in serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you going to do\nYeah this is as us exactly my point is going to take sanctions maybe Boise the youngest son's yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk\nMaybe who knows is that does the job description doing good journalism in Egypt yet\n[laughter] [noise] make so much think I Would give you any communist my numbers on there and [noise]\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you do know what his fate it at all I mean we found out whether did you suffer for this question in any way nobody had his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I and many exits Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally oh I'm good I'm good I\nLike I reached him by Skype you told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I started lighting up too easy to get them together them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you shouldn't line up with the government's priority\nYeah these messages were from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this if you will be an anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf ...\nHe's in trouble for out of the ones that are seeing these kind of makes it\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome over there where you know some

Nairobi\nMy safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother and I ... in your your it's

... it's hard enough you can feel a little wax on the paper [noise] um\nYeah but then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call from the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah it's a school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology\nI think they were doing this study for the FDA\nVery experimental and her mom signed her up long story short a Emily shows up to the White House school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed gives her this thing he get his device can you describe it I mean is it a big moment\nNo it's not it's just say and regular pair of sunglasses\nThough they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because of right on the front like on the bridge in the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attached to the sunglasses was a little\nWire that ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing has made a titanium and it's just like the size of a postage stamp or a little bit thicker though\nAt explained or is it a little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square budget on your time put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd close your mouth so I put it on and they turned\nIt on 'em and it was like is there is to take all imagine\nA lot of Coca Cola like a lot of bubbles on your town and always like frankly\nIdea behind this thing called a science writer Sam Kean author of detail of doing or surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes and it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing in ... years and during the hearing in her fingers in ... in the teasing attaching\nBut that's actually not her words each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves and it is the brain that then converts of little blurbs into what you perceive as a site or sound or smell no obviously someone who was blind the retina is not\nSending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains\nIn all of our brains there are lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it shut down in traffic can be on it but what if you could open up some of those rat\nAges may I say with an eye for an hour two hours and\nEmily said at first she had no idea what was happening she would just with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change and every time I looked around he said\nOh that's a chair\nThat door that's me\nThat's your mom and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square of plastic nana and nothing was really happening for except for the perfectly feelings on her tongue\nBut then there was this moment add had this really long Styrofoam rod and the last day in front of me he moved at down in front of my face [noise]\nAnd ... oh my God what was that [noise]\nSuddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter]\nIt just happened I oh what did it look like in some of The Mind's eye it looks like\nA long white skinny stick did you see the texture of the sticker I'm no accident the texture I couldn't see in three dimensions it was very flat and it's kind of like\nThat kid's toy like right yeah so imagine like a black screen and little tiny white dots on the ranch in line\nTo Emily was allowed to keep the brain poor device for about a year and a half and during that time the light right resolution of it did get better as her brain learn to speak tone it was awesome\nWhen I saw the people\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street and she told me they usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city\nEspecially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI uh [noise]\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like I just fucking\nAgonized here to ... and the sounds of ...\nWhich he says when she put the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk when\nCame alive [laughter] I thought it was amazing like I didn't\nKnow many people are on the street at the same time is now they're um [noise] they're all there again would you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike\nReally soft last chance it everything stops nice soft ... says\nHe believes that can move\nThere is a volcanic is either last living and I could see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see ... or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or shorts or address [noise] has I just say see their shadows\nAnd every now and and I see the light pass it on them really yeah [noise]\nI've mentioned some alec underwater creatures squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah like lady yeah\n\nYeah like that [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nAnd that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is\n[noise] hazy sea of walking fish that [noise] make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\nOoh [noise]\n\n\nWe were
