I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ...\nHe's been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside rode out through thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurt somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had to each of them by\nThemselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad will happen to him\nWhat was happening in the name is ...

all of a sudden they spotted than the killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you

A. B.\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and just before the break we were about to hear Robert Guerra the man accused of murdering a teenager [noise] Joe his attorney what really happened\nYeah and we're going to jump right back into that but uh if you're just doing it now you should be warned that they are at what comes next is uh probably not suitable for the ears of young kids are sensitive listeners so be warned ... we go back to reporter benefit [noise]\nAt this point it was just ... in the room and he told him yes he had killed them ... and he also killed other people\nToo and the episodes when Darrow killed people seemed to have\nFollowed a like a pattern you would get these intense headaches and you know become psychotic and\nDo horrible things when it came to the details you tend to\nNot remember but then\nGary mentioned two particular girls who were then missing\nAnd whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year old student pilots and another girl sixteen year old only ... [noise]\nIsn't that was from Chicago She's a girl I mentioned earlier cops are already looking for her hoping that Carol might have some information\nEarlier that summer her boyfriend had been found murdered the two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since a leash a hawk she was a high school girl from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGarrett told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents she doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with mine nights she\nStayed with minor like it wasn't even doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself is this true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be a dreamy had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and presented strategy you need to know uh what actually happened W walks out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go\nSo they they slip outside they get in the car and\nWe take off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up\nMine shaft the mind up bin ... about an hour south of the hospital ...\nFederal runners and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you rub pie it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food for you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm\nLady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose I Need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here which\nBe as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father says it them a road that goes to the miners are what is your after the march [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly seats are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking right in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came\nIn here so right so here we are in our Sunday suits and there we go trudging to force looking for the\n[noise]\nBut lovable worse look [noise]\nWe found this was her well\nYou see the air shaft fair they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for that says get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\n\nAnd and a leg I said to myself the son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your money back up ...\n\nEventually algae found the other body at least your house body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just care we took her to know to keep your confidences over wire under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there is no if if if people are already dead then you ... the the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for their clients\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only\nThe agent of him or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of tell just tell tell of course\nYes and I knew Mr hawk from ... to his his du da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from sturgeon\nWas if you have to be and then I'm On a few dang pushes the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nAnd then it's time for the defense to start their case to Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand Garrett gets on stand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible [noise]\nSevere beatings and abused by his parents very little education basically gets\nSent off to a farm to work like as an indentured servants when he's seven slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he starts like drinking blood I'm having sex and the animals and then he starts admitting to\nA series of rapes throughout his adult life and he admits to killing Alicia and Susan\nAnd what happens next and nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when Garrett was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian our money while the press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told anyone\nSurvive without Robert does the ... because they had the duty to protect our clients secret for reading or abroad with ear but\nEveryone is disgusted those columns written editorials written letters to the auditor\nOr just no way in the world you're going from your average non lawyer if everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some version of the law of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors laid off that our money and Dell jihad actually tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law too\nBusy with our money was getting death threats in the mail and I'd just as crews you phone call people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself I'm going to kill you only get to at one point he finds a dead fish in his car\nHis wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard he started to carry a purse through my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so\nRecruits leave those those are the worst moment to [noise] er some horrible for\nHis thoughts\nJune twenty seventh Robert ... rose convicted for the murder of silk dumplings ski he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how ... how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nThen it up to the injury itself in there and to ... to determine which charges they should bring against the two attorneys ... pretty soon after the ...\nOur money indulge you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nStates public health law and the provision that says the body must be given quick in decent burial and on top of that\nGroup where\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarmament an investigation into the ethical complaint that would drag on several years\nSpelled G started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money talked it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or was like you know well what else can I Do\nTo make a living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure to ...\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is that\nWhat Belgian or money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was look\nFeast does what does this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go with you here are just was a lawyer to do the job [noise]\nUh ... I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case it's taught in schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just\nStand up [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\nMm\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I\nWrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan\nWas the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mind you know as as\nExplain before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew the law schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWhat his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far is to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a total Eli the lawyer maybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "28"}
