the way we live [noise] I just buy a bottle of water and on the label is head gluten free interest [laughter]\nWell and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encourage the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes it was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Am most just in Iowa and again you can't believe the drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nWe got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself I wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either some of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well\nMeanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like one day we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want a tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people are gonna let you and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the basics vegan before six and a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's your only choice [noise]\n\nSomething given a choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nThe answers can absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states of that for ...\nFifty billion of it is gross profit now health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent is chronic metabolic disease of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry's mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer is\nReal food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for everyone\nAt that weight I'm assuming the sugar industry really hate you sure yeah they intend words\nOr less yeah they they love me yeah that's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision\nAnd then but not many people are saying what you're saying I mean you know look\nA lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing children\nGet to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest [noise]\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college yeah just just a little bit\nOf course now and again the problem is\nI'm for dessert\nFor dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and take a priest son and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem [noise]\nMore\nOr less take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at Ted got NPR dot org were back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas about how we connect to food I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to the Ted radio hour\nFrom NPR is one city age and this is WABC way ATM ... thanks suspending probably be a weekend with us everyone who's votes WIP this weekend is being entered into a drawing to win a one thousand dollar apple gift card that's kind of see of leap frog\nPeacemaker donation now online uh WABC dot org ... six seven eight to five five three Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nSupport for WABC comes from Atlanta history center presenting the C.
