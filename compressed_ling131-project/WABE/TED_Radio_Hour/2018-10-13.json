changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise to [noise]\nLike to have you look at the pencil it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nAnd so her books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal things the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these\nGreat apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually free men were persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be ... [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so\nExample in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\n[noise] [noise] [noise] even why these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals because he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer ... now\nI read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of non human animals\nAre and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals as ... I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons now at that time there was very little\nKnown about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on when I knew it was going to take a long time\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal movement is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nHundreds of experiments worldwide with this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected nonchalant people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things I fix them parliament's\nThese Ninety nine randomly selected sample of people went through weekends of deliberation informed by X\nIt's with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was then put to a referendum on about two thirds the Irish people agreed with them if these people are so good at is why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of how laws get made Abu understand the consequences like that's what I Want\nSo how does a random democracy you know solve this problem elections\nDon't produce experts this is a complete jealousy otherwise we would elect our brain surgeons um yeah elections produce people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to\nInspire people with ... tweets I don't I'm not sure but it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy making so I Would actually argue that's a random representative sample with good persists informed by experts who've costs or don't have power they just have the power to give information um\nWould result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through the induction process where they learn about how the system guys will how low making is made except for\nThe other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is exactly what author returned regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of ex threats so yeah I think it's it's a you open yourself up to the accusations of authoritarianism if you say I think we should actually handed over to a tech not proceed you'll suddenly\nWell that's the thing like let me see if I understand correctly\nIn a system that you think would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate the lectures yes right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you would have some kind of system a lottery ... a lottery whatever it is where people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and they say hey you know you're going to be represented for the next two years and that's\n[noise] that's how you would you do do a there's a lot of pros and questions around there but the key thing is that it works when people do this people make trusted balance decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase interest in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my [noise]\nAnd we come back and just a moment red headache describes how he envisions randomly selecting leaders on the show today hacking the law I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nIt's one said hey good afternoon I'm much access and this is W.

replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random section of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog of Adam's saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand up for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nAnd in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution chamber once with ... and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of\nPoliticians busy back stabbing each other and engaging the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber uh this is a path to old is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute the pollen and tried to society of friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nIf you don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these mountain examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nRealistically if I can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have out strategy or and that is yet to to get the ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds\nTo a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the ...\nMaybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies flickered basalt dish and that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try and convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... it 'em ups are those things will be easy to political changes ... seats are especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to own a unified on to try something new I seek help system's broken and unknown to see a change [noise]", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "13"}
