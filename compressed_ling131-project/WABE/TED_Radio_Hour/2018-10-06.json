that we could dream about doing but no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter\nAbsolutely that's exactly what it does and I'll just add one copy out it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so if you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients comes the additional challenge of\nGetting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patience\nNow the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health can be achieved the ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just

I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists\nOf gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know [noise]\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with Avi A. F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever need\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting\nEditing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the richest HIV immunity genes your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course where we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very radio issue of directing future evolution you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] hamster and Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nHow can they show we're asking a very important question is who are we [noise]\nOkay do you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I have a a a an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are probably effective at reducing anxiety and phobias and treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial soul they uh are ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry is so intricate complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social ah\nMechanisms of of interacting to language to facial expression their body language that there are ways of of changing our feelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and uh and and art and of evidence based cycle therapy\nSo there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the Angelo given personality type and we can probe the outside of the ... the genes make available to us [noise]\nDo you when you think about what what and an eight person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because we interactions are so unfathomable a complex yeah there are tend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion synopsis and no one can keep track of all of them even in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or\nEnvironments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together and not not the exotic cases of twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins that all of us know\nIf you notice a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar to two people plucked off the street at random\nBut they're unique individuals out there that you won't you don't confuse them once you know and sometimes they're not friends and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a now how do you account for those differences it's not fair ... at least not the ones they inherited from their parents there could be some uh a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic required\nA it's not there by and large their environments because they grew up and do the same parents the same school the same house the same older subs framed younger sibs [noise]\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a for a chance for the role of the dice in a who have become because ah [noise]\nTo people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level
