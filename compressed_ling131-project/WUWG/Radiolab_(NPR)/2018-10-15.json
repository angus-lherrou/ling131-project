K.\n[noise] [noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio around you and why [noise]\nIt's\nTime now to practice some very useful phrase is I'll save them first you repeat I learn together\nThis is radio lab today translation it's time to begin while five experiments in translation trends creation\nSome number one the best and worst by my mother got got a few people will be my mouth [noise] no you try [noise]\nHi there Hi Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nHoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University\nHi Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nYou may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in him a things are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen the year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class and one day I came across this poem\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long thin sausage here to fall off you know three syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized it I still not\nBy heart diplomas basically a get well card threatened by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Eighteen hundreds that the court of queen and he wrote the pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and\nShe'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could she said and Frank let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a ... done was that in ... to a sick demos ... so to speak securing lady us that young lady\nMoney on those who doesn't who ... who says do secrete some guinea who ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the top ... coffee to ... to ... to ... ... ... ... to dwell on the bone young\nI'm like I didn't have gotten so many chicks and your dad was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... and\nHe reads the bone files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped\nWhat kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what\nI meant was to set we\nHere's the thing he says he got this power money and you know who doesn't look ... if you just focus on the words of basically just the the guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison to sue the peace or I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world on on the get out of bed\nEat some jam coffee too so you don't look so pale and you lose your plump shape ... or ... like get better here's to good health\nTo dwell on the bone in young\nNot just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ... the tone the light hearted mess and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA BBC CD and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to have them all the other one I did I say three syllables per lawyer you didn't or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way he began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the ... for example vast sea onto the tub Bush keeps a crucial that this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nA lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in ... instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their ... squirming in your head of slurping flop and that of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with if\nWant me to read my ...\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest dislike jail so don't AOL very long just gets strong go outside take a ride to it quick status\nBest you're forced rest dislike jail so don't AOL very long just gets strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise help be near my sweet dear\nSo claim always now Douglas Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the other ones are sham became bread though the bread and butter butter bread\nYeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly ear implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on ... just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well I'll give it a try\nFerris friend let me send my embrace\nThis place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fleet off with Clement\nVery different in tone\nAnd really quite marvelous he\nGot the pale face in there you go to Jan\nClements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but ... says no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number so that's just two lines so no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable Paul I'm uh twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the thing funny and charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails the foreign he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people doctoral\nStudents who my sweet treat one regard motives hard ... colleagues friends chicken de ...\nStudents who my sweet treat one regard to hard dear colleagues friends chicken D.

this is also one of his but like a Twenty one he did\nTeach those went from ... some dumb bug drag you down that friends\nAt this point everybody just not ... they're all looking every journalist who obviously had to take considerable personal recipe in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state run TV station feed this guy's on camera asking disagree truly sensitive question

I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious\nThan when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry it sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nHere is the word serious in East Africa and can be translated very much in are you feeling something preferably non Lincoln financial transaction and so what the journalists were saying is\nYou are you just log in London or you know doing something maybe threatening you will be a who is withdrawing eight or ... porn and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about the way

individuals and that is the policy of our government and this was serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it and it seems to me maybe you know\nYou can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I don't like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response do you think he was aware\nOf the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards\nMy name is ... he's a young guy and he's twenty two years in independent journalist yeah I used to work

biggest Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedian for me to\nSay is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time mode is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the\nMore interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from like ... legally and one of\nNext favorite curling nurse and I really like just went to is about how Carlin hated you ...\nYou know so it was not something that he got from like schooling\nLegally and one of got mixed favorite colonel immersing I really like just went to is about how Carlin hated euphemism I don't\nLike words that hide the truth I don't like words the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both ethical\nAnd we have people in this country normal people we ship them all away\nAnd we brought in these\nSenior citizen\nAnd he was on some of that\nThe reason we use you if it's just been through my father in law died five four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nBut you just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that he'll\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it did like Dole's\nOur reactions to it that actually have like a kind of a
