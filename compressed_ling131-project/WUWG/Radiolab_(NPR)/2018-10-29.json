the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun\nCalmly and clearly walked into the forest and nuts began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nWas the scene like a never been seen before or after\nToday where you've broken down our manpower into a ... for trolls\nMen armed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns flood home that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nSaying

trail and Senate very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there\nBut you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nNo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut he wouldn't talk at this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do\nAnd what a good person should do\nIn the situation\nAnd we are so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly age aren't many in front\nOf a lawyer in Syracuse\nThey never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use that money but it is or money my\nCouple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well\nWere there just to give it a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid\nHe got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway and it was a fighter at like ... flights go fight like standing up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting this state and ...\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nDefend that you're fighting this state and ...\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert Kara blacker strong to take him out you need a forty five\nTake off to go look for the bodies arrows told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft the\nMind is up ... about an hour south of the hospital in Iran and in that moment where you scared were you excited level do apply to a guy but you're scared you're concerned\nYou fear for me to do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police [noise]\nSo then surely they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm\nLady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car and then\nWe went off the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose and need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this method is as far as\nWe walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and\nLetting towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father so that some of the road that goes to the miners are what is clear to them on [noise] it was that sort of hilly area south side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just argue\nVery icy that day\nHis hair was used to be an all roadway [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded\nVery icy that day\nThis hair issues to be an roadway [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they came in here\nRight up there so here we are in our Sunday suits Rico trudging choose for is looking for the case [noise]\nBut no worse book [noise]\nWe found this for her to well you see the airship after\nThey find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground in a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for them this is good and he said yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and let me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak\nMan and a leg said to myself the son of a bitch desert [noise] and he yells back up to ... get me out of your backup\n\nActually\n... found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there went down the founder so what ensued was a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's see how that played that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can do to care\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can do to care we took her to know to keep fit confidences over wire\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since that time this happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be ... that it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead\nAnd there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectors and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if the people are already dead then you ... ... ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates\nEven if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for their clients the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent a plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens freight is there a week here building on on the side of tell just tell\nTale of course yeah soon I knew Mr ... from ... says to the other daughter my daughter were

P. B. okay hey I'm ... I'm I'm rods I'm Robert Krulwich has radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral do when we left it there were where they were stuck right there was a new this thing\nBut it was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what which their next move\nWild so they decided to put the burden plea bargain to take this information to the prosecutor and say I have information that will help you solve some cases\nSome cases yes and in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my client to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea yeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take a little while it's kinda gross you know\nAn investigation into the ethical complaint\nThat would drag on several years\nBell do started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida our money talked it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or were sick you know well what else can I Do\nTo make your living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older to stress and pressure\nShould Trump toll\nIn fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the\nBelgian or money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nThey told me about this penalty organized back into that\nThey spent and the difference between\nAtticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person at least they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven is for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers\nAnd they were there to watch on stage it was featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nSays what does this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nWhatever dream I don't go was here or there was a lawyer the director's job\nI was a good lawyer [noise] so I thought\nSo art everybody um\nAnd now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone\nFor the people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham\nJust stand up [noise] um [noise] I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been sitting in on these\nClasses and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because president can point to that can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\nMm\nThe from from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me and but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAs she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you\nCall she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan's mother\nWho's in the girl from Chicago She was a college student who had gone missing washing camping with her boyfriend and uh she's who our money and don't you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes\nAnd comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out two years and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind it's not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the the that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend\nWas his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nAnd and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas from when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a total Eli the lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nShow anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of\nSensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate and all of that um\nExperience yeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I I get it and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that does not to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree pass to mostly ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um [noise]\nAnd Danny courts her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship\n[noise] Danny what's your boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship any a graduate of the year before too\nAnd I'm sure the other two children get great future I had a true and it's just tragic\nOh\nTo be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how do you relate to lose your your daughter [noise]\nUm what what excuses for\nProtecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nThat's the way it is\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)",
