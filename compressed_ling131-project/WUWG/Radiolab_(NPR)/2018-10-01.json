Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the lie there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it\nOr a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it but if you've been trained and you know what to look for ... it will strike you right in the face speaking faces\nAre dark near ... peculiar brand ... specializes and had to do it with something that he call micro facial expression or very fast\nRacial expression about twenty fifth of his second okay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling\nBut on the inside of you know you can attest maybe you've got some rage a little a little bit in just a little bit but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that\nSome reach a little little being just a little bit but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is win for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that interagency slips out on your face\nThat they went on again and then they went ... and ... all of their time together\nHim well I don't remember when\nIt turned at some point she started to\nA lot of problems small crises started to come out a whole series I think they were problems insurance problems you know I've got a situation where I Need to move out of the place from currently living and that's because my roommates [noise] you know crazy he\nFelt himself sort of pulling back yes yes until one evening he gets a call from her and she totally passages\nOr you have to come over we have something we really need to talk about it at this point I mean I have no idea what it is now it is time [noise] but ah she said\nHey I'm pregnant [noise] I think I'm pregnant\nWell what did you do well he basically ... up into the right thing\nThere really was a part of me that was thinking well here's the test of a person\nIs going to stand by her and support Richard pregnancy and he said okay let's go to the doctor together\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at\nThe doctor's office when I Would say okay and I would go\nSee the early ... off to forty five [noise]\nAnd uh she would not be there three Fifteen would roll around him three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone and the perception is sort of ... can I help you\nShe would say oh well that that one was at one o'clock or I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed in it I could see the handwriting was indeed it was always comes up she signed it two hours earlier\nSo yeah yeah and as discontinued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in which so clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he gets a call from a woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture\nShe showed up with just all of us\nName's Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture\nShe showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared [noise]\nCleaning the back behind so it was right around that point where a check bounced and I was like oh now and so through a mutual friend she tracked\nDown to ...

go into hopes room and start looking through her son I just thought you know I'm just going to go through to see what's in here\nAnd that's when I found those notebooks\nSpiral bound up on an inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them\nCredit card numbers mothers' maiden name birth date page after page of that kind of information on what exactly was is these are like crib notes or con woman that's when I called Jude and I said to get over here [noise] what did you do at this point well Jude knew he had\nTo do something I finally got up\nThe courage\nTo confront open say\nIn my own responsibilities you're not withstanding to be\nPregnancy and what about Leslie at this point where she will lovely wondered how many of those people in a notebook hoping not through Craig's list which is where Langley but her so she went back to Craig's list and started posting warnings many times\nI think they will white female make specific I mean

started from their their time we talked to one victim it led to one or two other victims hope has a almost like a cult following you know her emo was that\nShe knew she got to know really well I talked a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore a lot of these people did some good\nHuman open heart things with her and said this poor girl I've got to help her out\nAnd there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and it's sad you know not only do you have to worry about cleared up your credit than getting your money back from your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now to you you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nDavid had that feeling\nOne of the house but the boundary in San Francisco you get found

responsibility\nTo Rafik ugly depiction of an awful name\nCheapest traumatized and\nThe whole experience he compared to an earthquake [noise]\n... you know number\nOne of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place so that was a minute ago there were days when\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything any consequences that was just [noise]\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ...\nBut it didn't say the Denver Nineteen or September Fifteen Percent September Seventeen to other\nPeople crying on the phone talking to me about the situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know and that's when they become detect that\nAre you know front of her mother's house in a\nOr a midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine then why are you there exactly I could kind of gotten a little\nTest with have gotten upset\nNo idea either\nThere is something about imagining\nHow she was doing all that cholera was really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie too but like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information\nNot around here ... ... where do you mean because what we're\nTalking back there\nOkay next great we hold up but what did you know about hope at this point well I knew she had had a daughter really anybody\nThe next ... but what did you know about hope at this point as well I knew she had had a daughter\nReally anybody home\nYou know not choose\nThe timing was all wrong\nAnd I had located the father while standing outside of hooks mother's town\nUp to date anyone inside the house\nNext morning I went out\nTo find a woman named ruby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana

go to Montessori together\nWhen Rudy opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would pick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and quite frankly I enjoyed having hope around\nIs there a notion that you've played a bunch of lawyers or the ... will hurt her ridiculous ridiculous that we her idea was that the liars would be over represented at a temp agency\nYou can probably imagine you know people who need to go to the temp agency are usually people who cannot remain in one job for very long period of time\nAnd it's not true of all people who work at a temp agencies most of them are just fine but some of them she figured keep ending up with a temp agency because they just have this\nProblem with their you know their lifestyle\nThe truth ... let's keep going I Want to hear how this comes out the yelling in her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the LA area interviewed a hundred and eight people\nThat's them all kinds of questions not just about their employment history but about their past their child the history of their families their personnel and nation checked their answers to those questions against their family and friends against their court records just to see if she could find people who stories and\nDo you know inconsistencies big ones that in the hundred and eight folks that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve a hundred and they'd say abortion or they pathological or is it depends on how you defined I Would hope that she found twelve people that she wanted to look at further she said to them would you be willing to come\nA hundred and they say a ... or they pathological or an it depends on how you define it we would hope that she found twelve people that you want to look at further she said to them would you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab and let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day but to above us how they would put people in the scanner and then we scan their\nBrain ticket everyone's ... all one hundred and eight of participants the liars and the non liars no one knew which group there and and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it cold ...\nThis is a part of the brain that part of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and Lawrence judgment for example\nNow if you knew him into that place just behind your forehead [noise]\nYou'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray matter\nAnd then you've got white matter I've heard of gray matter yes well we think of the brain is being gray but actually too thick gray and white race stuff kind of think of it was like the computer processor part yeah these little clumps of neurons in the process information\n[noise] computer chip [noise]\nThat's the great where's the white white matter it's like that the connection between all these ... care in the way met her in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the thinking happens and then why is when you move the thought from here\nTransfer inflation from one end to the ...\nBecause they've got your grave that you're white what yelling thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I\nFound out we see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing some things is ugly she thought she would find less gritty stuff less of the thinking why would why would\nWhy because that's what she's seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have ...\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures back what you saw was such a great increase\nNot agree more white matter\nMore twenty five and a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means\nMore twenty five or ten and a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nReally bubbling\nI thought this was this something something something something shift gears her idea so far she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role\nIn a kind of in the moments storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example okay you're leaving work you're\nOn the on bitter and annoying\nCoworker corners you hey Sallie corners you in\nThe elevator hey\nTo ask you you really want to go out with me on friday\nQuestions dangling in the air tomorrow\nFor most of us right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking\nThey made a point in my mind what do you think think think reaching out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm like well don't show on\nReally what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like um to me tonight teeth dentist and connect them\nAll together having some kind of over ...\nWe can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with\nThey get their faster at night and you have ... have you back in yoga I have to ... make\nThem more to nation Murray beekeeping at the end of the speed of the packaging holding him from one idea or not there and you can come up with more on random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have when you're in trouble if I said you like going to come out with being a friday night would you not be able to come up with a ...
