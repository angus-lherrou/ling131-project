I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something Thai okay good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it\nFor the thinking I'll start at the beginning you start getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and\nHow many people do we see killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right Jason Harris and about John become sort of a national story\nPersonally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nThere a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nThe problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody's track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself and the police department it does on the local level\nTrack these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police aren't itself and the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police\nShot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\n[noise] so birth study had Florida since a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places so horse of government sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida and three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years or so paper\nAny paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting this involves a year of work county police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive saying that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for\nBack we send our producer met ... down to the Tampa Bay times always with them right now to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we got him broken\nDown by county but you can see a\nShow a or B bay county\n... beach uh all the way\nThrough the alphabet said basically just has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nA combination of a use of force reports it's civil court records and media clippings represent\nHundred and thirty one\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and then in six years time two thousand nine to ...\nEight hundred and thirty one\nI Hope every shooting and the state of Florida in the ... and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise] so we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how that we can\nCompile the data and build a data base and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nMiss all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency the keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime some of the things have been found and initially\nSome of it you know kind of surprised us well the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nSays if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they ... about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year which seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ...\nMakes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like in the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at a time of the shooting and even that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they coal suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen\nDoor and raised as a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently not\nSo but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are\nBlack and that is a data out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nNear what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the talent these for their same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk with an numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we had these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but to me further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far and ... percent six kind of person he says one percent of the ripple more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one\nUltimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what\nI mean it seems like the I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis methane gas bill just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nI mean they're all written in this ah\nInvestigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato as Daryl police big Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife in apartment to five five but every one of these five every report is at least one human life\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has never been charged ...\nSo it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of read\nAfter the event ended at community center for like a bunch of Mondale got in their cars and drove over to the little gem shop\nAnd he got every every event or a no no no one has been telling everyone about then\n... says her son Andrew died in ... fourteen\nI don't know we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping for you right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way of the crystal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with\nMy grief you can either get the um the largest age at there and going because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay because I Want to do like your house like a like a like\nOut but my windows and I just knew will go through the house she's had page comes around and you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women\nIm shop over Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house and the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking Jews talking to bend about is Dorrie crystal and cousins were in the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nMan now redoing that I'm getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over here is how\nWe see each other head on the couch you know I'm imagining it becomes like a huge leap over energy policy for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other in March or the vice over his shoulder like therapy for\n... let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that\n... to\nWin crystal at some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nTwelve people out and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy\nGrad so we usually in a video that\nThe police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nCame and he came right here [noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden coast\nAnd all that but I I and then you know\nUm when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and we came back here all you can smell it\nHis um when they when they you know when he took him away in released and sit down and we came back here all you can smell it on and so now like when you got any like is is that it is not as bad now but just the whole chase Michael went unpaid onions and you get that smell like it just\nI Do ...\nBrings you right back here ...\nThe toy was just kind of stood there for a minute a\nI just started ... some of the other one that started crying\nThen you don't want me to uh take them on my mind a bit about what about a farm and make a couple of women in their home may\nAnd it's probably about the eight women who\nIdled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith a sort of straight days three two one\nThree two one\nStarted walking back to the cars\nWondering if I wrote a week and I Armageddon\nI three o'clock in the morning and\nI remember being like to tell you how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh I Would have that was years\nAre up to\nTo go there all the time or or\nOr yeah the lord how could you not to\nYou want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah Randy's\nCrazy because by it but with an s a cemetery like a little bit further out ...\nLaw about yeah like uh\nSit there yeah\nCrazy because like it but with and it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nIn his crazy you know about is like a certain time every day and it's been a little white man we share everything\nHe literally I think he does he like go have lunch everyday\nNot the way I like going on and all of that in a little while I got to always say not do\nYou think he's chair of gamble holes\nTrip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal who was the mother is ... she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother I\nWas loaded into the ground\nOr understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers the ...\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because then it's short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nAt the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and ... with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between any\nEnergy [noise]\nSo stay with [noise]\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between that you're going to get [noise] so stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South

W. W. W. dot ... dot org\nThat's the kind of talking to them cop wearing the body can end this black man because on race pretty big negative than any walking towards the ... don't you\nKnow crazy [noise] like I gets\nCloser and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body chemicals out occasionally the other officer out it was free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nHolding down\nIs approaching approaching approaching approaching he gets like ten feet of the cops and then\n\nThe guy was buddy campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the nights in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she changed central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart I Do have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming I mean you're\nLucky you didn't just shot one is your best shot I Want to die if you want to die you came back\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody know to police boss can't kill\nA fan of one to\nGo to the to pick them up walk them over to the squad car put them in and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys what do you use this video for what\nOver to the squad car with a man and he went oh\nThis is the thing that you guys what do you use this video for what it says warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the corner tried to stab woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that you might have been painfully reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun so\nYou know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest a communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact spread\nI mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was at a faceless and I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nAbout how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up to ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nOf biking through the neighborhood you might miss it on the front step waves to meet you what are you doing man Derek does stupid set up a bit you don't have close came to be in bed ... wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs which is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners Daytona they just ... heads out Willacy county sheriff would was elected sheriff of Linn county\n\nThe county that Daytona Beach belongs to any other thing to mention is that a typical on his organization called ... which has decreased executive research forum big coalition of police chief twenty six team put out what the\nHis organization called her which has decreased executive research forum it ... being coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some beans law and order law and order is\nSanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie the international association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly\nDespite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations\nPolice weren't talking about this two or three years ago I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n\nThere was this experience than I had read\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont radio lab is

from a piano [noise]\nTonight at eight on gp Amjad Ron I'm Robert\nKrulwich this is radio that we had been discussing police violence and race mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's\nThe feeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing um because\nWell bullet ...\nReporters take from here we are here to see the Tosh climate ... mother Rodney natural [noise]\nThe ... the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met born in ... other mothers who lost their children that actually when I first met her bed and have been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point I mean you're there because Ben what's going to hand a ton of documents over ten Tasha on her son Ronnie the case 'cause she didn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview with ... but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started hobby [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I just had no idea\n\nAnd I just had no\n[noise]\n\nEventually this trend that tape recorder off\nWhat was what was happening in that moment okay so to back up and some meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a trip would um share of the police chief that they only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that\nIt goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers have done nothing wrong it acted in accordance with the law\nAnd it just so happened that forty five minutes before then and I\nShowed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that
