H. D. Gerald Ford of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning or that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are seeing and swaying\nTwenty seven a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass doors headquarters of\nFacebook\nYeah [noise] but the humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there are you guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm definitely newer\nAnd what what are you calling from St\nNurse in as in like breast feeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nStephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this\nSmall peaceful protest ...\nWill turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook and\nOne of the opening shot in the book triggered a horde knows even what would become a loud\nBut do Facebook rockets\nAnd global bad embattled the book the black today playing defense and now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against roe kingdom what we can say in what we can't say it again but I'm just like ... ... what we\nCan see and what we can see land Mueller white kids in front of the only\nOn the Internet and\n\nMr Zarqa America got to\nYou use objectively prioritized or ... oh\nMr sack of arc I got to\nYou some jak laid prioritize or sensors meaning\nCongresswoman we don't go over doing of censoring speech but there are types of ...\nWhat what really grabbed me was all it was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you print it off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe\nWhich made me wonder like why are these roles\nWere they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in\nThe morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\nYou know building right behind the protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to search and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employee one on one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand\nSeismic change in the week and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website in the U.S so it's had somewhere in\nOf ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their screen flag to Facebook\nAnd on Lake meaning like I use it\nThe long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flag to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content\nAnd then that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were seeing was either naked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and every time something pop up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this [noise]\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one page long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nFriday's fight for the rights of breath anyway about a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache\nBut according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest they just jumped typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group\nTo do a virtual nurse in two for one\nChanged their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status too\nTwo for one day changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status to\nThe title of our group a phase of breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on the social networking website is under fire for and policy on photos of women brand new meeting their child right down in twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in the wrong thing by hitting\nBecause we've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to be able to\nCount pilots say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nWho are in this building where but as far as the content moderators\nAround twenty can they decided to start outsourcing some of the fork places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora ... as well as\nI Would guess that they're\nSubways and where we sent reporters Guerra stack\nScene where the guys are still should say secrete everybody fever English and we\nSent them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like well\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks were able to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting infamy happening\nA lot of all the good work if I\nCan go now I got my search by these you\nMost people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company so there's there's something wrong about being in like an NBA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know or do you not want to be named\nI'd rather not totally fine you know I don't want to take care\nTo be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I'm just going to end victory I don't want to move here\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to find these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract prohibit any ... about ...\nMind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nTo I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year can show up to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five ... every day I was just an edge as officials and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he he said\nBasically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of this is like ... or ... to ... to extradite or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain it to you know get squashed by attack to you know people ... like\n[noise] Thirteen year old girl uh having sex with in a way to just watch it over and over\nClinton did you did this like keep you up at night as you do this\nSo they set 'em up at night uh he'd\nCatch him self thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat they were there was such a like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I F like okay\nSo I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... S C I like okay I ... I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had that I chose to ... [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's classic adjusted see\nDifferent moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah what a job oh wow yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more of this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they yeah they uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving onto our second story here there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out well but it will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke to readers hey All right okay oh there was so we take a break and come right back I think we should\nSay this is Jenny calling for Lima through radio lab and supported by transfer why an online service that let people send and receive money internationally send their border list the countless customers Holden convert most currencies anytime more transfer wise dot com and the\nChain that from a Hindi now you can put in my target resenting future at heart pod casting change makers and the raw Jack Kemp gaining in communities nationwide feature at every level on apple bought ... bought guns are found\n[noise] for [noise]\nFor [noise] for [noise] for\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThree two one Jeb Robert radiolab today we are discussing censorship and Facebook with our producer Simon Adler\nThat thing once you do provide refined ...\nSo a couple of months back I think we sent our parents interns\nCarter Hi Jan lives eager to this cramped narrow little comedy club\nAnd we sent them there to check of someone else who found a fault line in fact what's real book\nSigning hurting right along the next ... days [noise]\nThese older friends was\nVery cool and you just\nGot dark curly hair was raised in Oklahoma\nRaised Jewish so when you're a Jewish you read about\nIn front of the law you know\nFrankly we'll get back in twenty sixteen she\nStarted this political running bit but I think can be called sort of a\nAbsurdist feminist come\nAt first I just had this running bet on line on Facebook and Twitter\nShe was tweeting posting jokes you know like we have all the buffalo wild wings surrounded you know things like that actually took the stage even wrote some\nMe a\nDiamond mine and [noise]\nOh\nMine and [noise]\nMy na\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a Marshall logs on to Facebook but a ... instead of seeing her normal news feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt says you posted something bad discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we've removed that post and so I'm like\nCan I possibly opposed it I really I I thought it was like a glitch but\nThen she quick to continue and their highlighted was violating post it was a photo of hers but what what is the picture can you describe it\nThis is me as well it can only be described as a cherub cute little seven year old with big curly hair and she's wearing this blue floral dress her teeth are all ...\nInto the photo Marcia had edited in a speech bubble\nThat just says kill all men\nAs that's funny you know because I had I had a it's funny you know it's just me whatever so um I posted again immediately after like yeah and it got removed again and this time there were consequences I got banned for three days after that\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept\nAnd converted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe and when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses\nThat um that's the tension care\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies are not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at face but if we want to have one line that we enforce\nConsistently but it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white\nThose rules\nGet compost\n\nWho was rules\nLike it\nShould be any from Denver, Colorado radiolab supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation in public understanding of science and technology and the modern world more information about Sloan at W.

Hi Robert Krulwich has radiolab we're back\nWith a story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are they're just you're just tuning in August episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but what we do want you to you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing and it gives you the kids in the room mate would set it up yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at what they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same type can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across\nIs trying to do two competing things at once [laughter] they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna run to Maryland but sorry but the my aunt had him up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise they wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carlos\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo me are the finish line locked in there\nYou answered it to begin to federal\nPeople or spring into action or just one man in a cowboy\nHat feed the spectator who who's been injured picked him up throws them in a wheelchair and they're pushing him through the\nThe sort of ash cloud a there's a photographer there any sap because\nThe photos show the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh is faces Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific [noise] meanwhile\nShe lives CBS the areas on the other side of the country the spine me I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news bring\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have memories of what we're watching some of the coverage shoveling new images just released the Boston bombing I remember seeing the\nPhoto published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly loaded going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by it\nAll right we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform and it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see\nYou could definitely see a bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down skip however half the ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy\nEventually this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receive\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and then there are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest\nOf the stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down\nBefore they can pull the lever words start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception of\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stamps you're not taking this down\nYes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher who would they don't think maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah ...\nThis brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want [noise]\nShouldn't about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now a news organization as trends parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of\nWhat exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest\nCenter this is a a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subject to defeat regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all this is is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound", "year": "2018", "show_name":
