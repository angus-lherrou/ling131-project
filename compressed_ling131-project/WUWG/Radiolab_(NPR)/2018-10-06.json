W. G. H. G. Carroll that part of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network\nBefore we start today's episode we want you to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be for one way you\nAre\nListening to radio lab\nRadio around in the mail you and why [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something pie\n[laughter] okay I think it's a good thing where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it for the thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start the game is what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again in\nHow many people do is they killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMe right hasten Harris sand about John or animal to come\nYeah at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire as mayor race and Harris than devote John him over there and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nThe problem is we don't know we have no idea because nobody attracts these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police turn itself and the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police\nShot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports so they're only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that's right so ... and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida so that their biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida\nThan in a lot of other places and ... got promoted and sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired\nA firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting this involves a year of work county police departments is getting lawyers involved is is a massive saying that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of for\nBack we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times always with him right here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages a stack\nOf paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a\nYou just had a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six until\nWe got him broken down by county but you can see a\nShow a or B bay county\nSoccer it's on the beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nSaid basically just has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nOr a combination of a use of force reports civil court records\nAnd media clippings represent\nHundred and thirty one [noise]\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in the ... and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise] so we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was there a chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how that we can compile the data and\nBuild a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this that the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the last couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category\nBeen says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody\nOh maybe off their meds any time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they coal suicide by cops which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill finally trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ...\nThis is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising\nThat a forty percent of people shot by police are black\n[noise] and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics near what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white southern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and is that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we had\nThese numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very far and ... percent six kind of person he says one percent of the report you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah the ... I mean [noise] I mean what [noise]\nI mean it seems like the I don't know it's back to where we were in why we want to start\nMethane gas bill just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nI mean they're all written in this ah\nInvestigations revealed that a SPIC officer Matthew Fowler receive a call on this is the Cato as Daryl police\nAnd I mean they're all written in this are\nInvestigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... ... to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five is confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has never been charged ...\nSo it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of read\nAfter the event ended at the community center has looked like a bunch of the mom bailed out in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nAnd he had every every event or a no no I just wanted to know the ones who had been telling everyone about then\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty fourteen\nI don't know we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way of the\nFirst of all gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain points\nLittle store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief and you can either get the um the large stage at their going because it was talking to two women should have this big bundle of stage in her hand\nBecause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nOpen my windows and I just knew will go through my house she took the stage comes right down the I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house and the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking Jews talking about is Dorrie crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nAnd now we're redoing that I'm getting motel room again this is Natasha Clinton we started to fail rate of how\nWe see each other bad I mean of cows to know I'm imagining it becomes like a huge leap over energy for corn asleep for up to talk eight you know getting to know each other or the ... like therapy for us\nI Can't let me ask what there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that\n... pounds to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nTwelve people out and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically did in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy\nGrad so we usually in a video message\nMom's house probably over like right\nThen the police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em\nMy father over like right\nIn the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and land in the opposite the day they had them came in\nCame and he came right here\nThat's why we call the extradition of vegetable garden coast\nWing and all that but I I and then\nWhen they when they you know when they took him away in released into down the papers that we came back here all you can smell what's going on now like when you play any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association like going up put onions and you get a meal like ages\n... and\nBrings you right back here ... [noise]\nIn the toy was just kind of stood there permitted\nArticles I just started ... the other one that started crying\nThen you don't want me to uh pick them up my mind the base a lot of what about the farm and make a couple of women had to be their own mind\nAnd it's probably about the eight women who\nIdled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight pays for three to one\nThree two one\nStarted walking back to the cars\nVarious by we wrote a week and I are\nOkay and I walk in the morning and\nI remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away\nMy gosh how was that was\nI remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away from\nMy gosh that was that was\nAnd\nTo go there all the time for\nYeah no more is how could you not to\nDay now like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah\nI mean it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAll these crazy you know about is like a certain time every day and\nIt's been a little white man we share everything like that but he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nWay I like going on and all of that little white guy to always say not do\nYou think he's chair of the whole\nTrip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal who was the mother is Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShoot on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Garner's mother I watch\nWas loaded into the ground\nAround the time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers of the [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because then it's short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nSupport group and suddenly become\nAccomplish the gun man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between\nSo stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida ... supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology and the modern world more information about slow that W.

I gets\nCloser and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body can pull out the taste of the other officer out it was a refrain is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\n\nDown is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then\n\nThe guy was buddy campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and in\nTheir management of it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming I mean\nYou're lucky you didn't do your best\nThey why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just show them that are trying to get shot you want to die I Want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police posts can't kill\nTheir fan of counseling on his\nFeet to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important because there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that you might have to leave reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact spread\nI mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a\nBlack man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in a faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think know\nHow he's going to deal with this thing ...\n\nActually after he finished watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood is limited on the front step waves and ... what are you doing man dared does stupid sounded would bet you don't have close came to be in that wouldn't be back with his medication I wasn't doing drugs is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNow again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women and felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left will\nLast primary election among them\nAnd so like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last science primary election among the winners they just have his now militia county sheriff shit would was elected in ... county\n[noise]\nThe county that the tone of each belongs to any other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nBig coalition of police chief twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nSanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest queasy knowing the nations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police BPA queasy in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous and then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly\nDespite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations\nAnd police weren't talking about this two or three years ago I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n\nThere was this experience than I had read\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont radiolab is supported in
