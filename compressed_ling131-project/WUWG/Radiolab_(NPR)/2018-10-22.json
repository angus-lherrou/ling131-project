the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship but about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that what don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping\nWe must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she got kids with a you may wanna might wanna yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nAnd are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\n[laughter] yeah [noise] but the humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there are guys\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling from St nurse\nIn as in like breast feeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest ...\nWill turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot ... book triggered hordes nosy and what would become a loud\nBut do Facebook rockets\nAnd global battle embattled Facebook the bar today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against roe kingdom Muslim what we can say in what we can't say by twenty to what we\nCan see and what we can lead Mueller white kids in front of me\nOn the Internet and\n\nMr duck America got to\nYou use objectively prioritized or sensors ...\nCongress woman we don't go for\nDoing of censoring speech and what they're\nCongresswoman we don't go over doing of censoring speech but there are types of ...\nWhat what really grabbed me was that was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and died\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter]\nYou know building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to search and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment [laughter]\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote didn't extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook in place\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis isn't nearly two thousand seismic changes in Lincoln the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path my space time is now the most visited website in the U.S can somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space\nThe vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them\nIn front of their own computer and things that come up onto their screen flag to Facebook and on Lake meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this cake clinics\nAnd a leg meaning like I use or something that I thought\nWas wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content\nAnd then that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were seeing was either naked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who'd been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ...\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nFriday's fight for the rights them breath anyway about a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache\nBut according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest they just don't take up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group\nTo do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status to the title of our group a face on breastfeeding is not a team and take caught on the social networking Web sites\nAnd then change their status to the title of our group a phase of breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on the social networking website is under fire for it and tell them the photos of women brand new meeting their child right down in\nBecause we've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to the ...\nCampaign would say it's about thirty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nIn this building where states such as sources content moderators\nAround twenty can they decided to start outsourcing some of the ... places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and draw as well as\nI Would guess that they're inside\nDublin where we sent reporters Garrett that\nScene where the guys are still should say secrete everybody fever English and we\nSend them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around two million flag bits of content to pop up on their screen every day wow what we what I'm just curious like what's what's that\nLike well\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting infamy happening\nA lot of all the good work and by so\nMany so now I don't I start to you\nMost people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's so is there something wrong about being in like an NBA that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather not totally fine you know I just go straight I don't want to I got here\nExplain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to find these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh\nOne of the year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract prohibit any clue about what ...\nMind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth of that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nTo be I I signed up to monitor traffic is\nJust a given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got it so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year can jump to his desk every morning put on his headphones like like a signal\nOr ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five ... every day I was just an image and the show and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of that says like radio ... a ... to ... to ... a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain

I Robert Krulwich radiolab we're back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are there are those who are just tuning in uh the episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because we were kids in the room when to set it up yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once [laughter]\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth\nI was into people's spread across the globe in ways that are Steyer and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen twenty third strike\nAnd Carlin Rhonda

other side of the country I mean I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nWe spoke employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so bad memories of lot of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just released the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo\nPublished on line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly load is going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking\nBritain by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see\nYou could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down skip however half the rooms says\nNo the other people are saying Mrs newsworthy\nEssentially the photos being posted everywhere else it's important that we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receipts push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and then there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like this ... to which the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest\nOf the stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box\nAnd in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down\nBefore they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception of ...\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stamps you're not taking this doubt yes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher who would they don't see maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now in news organizations ads transparency\nMe get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking\nOr yeah it is it now and news organizations ads transparency\nLet me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of\nWhat exactly Facebook is\nThis question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that same compatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the ... will Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subject to defeat regulations\nHowever were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically
