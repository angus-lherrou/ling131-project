hope for the outcome\nThe voting so what do you think that means we want to hear from you or what are you seeing from campaigns and from candidates in your state in in your district in what do you hope for the outcome\nIn these midterm elections where one eight hundred forty three eight to five five and I'm joined today by Janet Hook national political reporter for the wall Street Journal and they can sell is editor and publisher of inside elections and Nathan before the break Janet was talking about how in Florida that gubernatorial race\nIs garnering a lot of attention and potentially pulling a lot of people to the polls and we heard a caller say exactly that so I was wondering if Florida serves as an example there are a couple of key states where gubernatorial races maybe yeah sort of more of the political center of gravity and who might that attracted to the polls [laughter]\nYou know I think is a specifically to Florida in specifically with Gillum I mean I think his ability if he can turn out a younger voters and African American voters in the mid term the way that in ... in times when Democrats have struggled to turn out those voters in midterm elections I think I could have an impact\nOf further down the ballot you know when we zooming out when were you have multiple house and Senate\nWhen we have multiple competitive races on the ballot sometimes I'm not sure what's which raised was driving what ... what I think it was interesting about the house in the Senate maps going back to that to America's is that there's actually not a ton of overlap between the competitive U.S House races\nAnd uh in the Senate map in Florida is Florida is one of the the exceptions to that where there are at least a handful of competitive house races but elsewhere you know the the pockets of the places where Democrats can make big house gain such as um New York and California I mean they have a neutral racist but they're not particularly competitive\nI see well let's take a quick call here and Gary is calling from Clarkson Michigan ... you're on the air\nThank you for having me on magnet thank you a panel for taking time to meet today and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what threat for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nNeighbor one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find two interesting things or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to back now one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously it's heavy manufacturing state\nThis is a state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump has gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was\nKind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through what the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so just a progressive guy was in office there but I Want to ask you this question out in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a wave coming in what the impact of what you saw in the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know it was one of the state began that what ... others proposal ballot your that will potentially\nUm changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan as always find it to be a very perplexing yeah which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there is one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a blue wave it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats have regrets and which were ... seems to have a pretty sizable I'm leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot\nThe incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection [noise] um\nAnd in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was by such a narrow margin read it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump and twenty twenty\nYeah and as Garrett was asking uh it seems the question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is water going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy in the next two years now that might that have an impact on uh on on Michigan on Michigan in Michigan workers\nWell it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he opposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump in his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next\nFor or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policy\nAgreement but um if there's one thing about Donald Trump in his policy that safe to say it's a kind of don't know what's next\nFor or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of or something is not working you can just turn a new one eighty and All right we're gonna we're gonna do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what does the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and and their view on the economy as well as how people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races are happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven Fowler is political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting at on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race well\nIt's a very close race there is also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day\nOkay so this is then one of the reasons why\nI'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules have become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a roof feuding uh Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot raided the offices and\nA hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rolls\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of passion feed the narrative because that or suppression isn't only about blocking that ... it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worry that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidates ... state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to get a scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nAs current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp even Fowler take give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has to come in the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nNot so much joined me anyway each weekday morning from five to nine here on any

Gonzales heat editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter\nFor the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nYep five magma thanks for taking my call [noise] um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other top big issues I'm leading up to this election\nAnd it it's just so ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions women's votes have said just the opposite I Know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election [noise]\nBut I mean you have do you have to be ... to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting condition [noise]\nWe'll thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said\nWell if a NATO was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats in every wondered whether or not it was an important in winning issue there's nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there's one issue that has really broad residence for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seemed to be\nFor people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seemed to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races of across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between uh the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen a asking\nSenator Heller to tell in Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nThey promise and protect their health care and that we knew what protect their protections for pre existing condition\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against in Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nDifferences tune turns you considered under charge you can say in a thousand times it's just not true wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican ... ... what's that bill includes pre existing conditions\nThan you are very well we'll talk in the eye and tell them to try and ordered by\nThat sort of debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Meghan Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't play radio dot org\nMaking welcome to the program I think for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race uh between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nAs you just heard during that back but but it's been a huge focal point of the race um you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic or a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact\nOr this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in the midst press conference that happened last summer where\nA Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerns about\nThe first repeal enter ... repeal and replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward but then he ended up actually voting in favor of of you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the\nThe repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she's run numerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she has this sort of memorable ad\nAttacking holler as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act stay with it but it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the ... and this late stage telling you\nWrite this race is still really close and you know if you if you listen to folks talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should have been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this cycle you know the most\nVulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re election on you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old um but most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wires they think that you know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how this message resonates with Nevada's nonpartisan are independent voters here\nUm you know whether they do how the significant concerns about health care and from what we've seen health care really is a top issue for voters here and about it now like all\nOf the nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nI think I'm One of the reasons why people do have a chance to gain seats is I'm not convinced\n... going to look for much of a hard core I really you know we had it as a toss we think we're supposed to for the whole the whole reason we're we're probably G but there are ... in the back and when my like I said you still going to want to lose\nWe've I think we've as opposed to for the whole the whole race will probably keep it there but in in the back of my my like you know I I think he's still going to I think he's going to lose and so that matters to them up but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff wakes open seat in Arizona\nAnd you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but it has been interesting in a plug all plugged in Nevada independent from Megan in in her boss John and and show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone\nWhat's what struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected [laughter]\nYou're just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two competitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending a Jackie raisins third district\nAnd the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy than moving money than they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term Nevada enough presidential in mid to Nevada tends to be more Republican maybe what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's\nOne of the interesting thing we went and sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen which we saw a complete Red Wings in Nevada and Republicans swept at\nYou know control all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive how the I truly was you know a red wave um which which stands in stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen\nOn that but that point I think back lay right you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well during the term elections and it's really going to come down to you know all that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get folks to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
