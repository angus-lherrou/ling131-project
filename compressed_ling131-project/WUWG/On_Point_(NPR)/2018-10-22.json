[laughter]\nAbout how I already in ... but not only be about hilarity but the heart and the the courage it's so amazing and the stories that they tell a it ... it turns it\nIt turns what we've produced into something of legend and of mythology and magic\nCan so about those stories I mean over the course of the ten seasons of drag racing for for folks who don't know actually I should let you explain for folks who don't know what the show is I mean but how would you describe will drag races\nWell it's a competition reality show where we are looking for America's next drug superstar and we put the\nCompetitors through a series of challenges\nThat are not unlike what my career has been I've done everything you could you name it in show business so the challenges are geared towards you know being a radio host or a TV producer a model or acting all of those things\nAnd at the end the two competitors who are\nAt the bottom who get the least points after lip sync for their lives and uh\nThey lip sync and or whoever does the best gets to stay and the one who doesn't have to leave the competition\nAnd you always remind them too don't bleep it up okay that's close to them going to

spectacular and is spectacularly already making up words now a of the drag queens the the the challenges that you just talked about the fun and the incredible high road I'm surprised that more of the the queens just don't have a nervous breakdown on their own every episode\nBut with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very\nIncredible things are about some of these drag queens say here are those moments\nWhen they got me exercise because they thought I was ...\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because straight now\nI just wanted to do and so for a\nLiving with for the love of my life so much that\nYou're going to be able to read from

that she was on the show that she was a drag queen or even that she's gay right\nYeah right yeah you know that the show\nChallenges the contestants to\nFiguratively die and become reborn into their higher cells and when I look back on my own life I realized that the worst things that happened to me ended up being the best thing that happened to me because I got to understand what real strength\nIs and what my own strength is and I think the people watching our show uh they get that and they they understand that at the core of our show it's about the tenacity of the human spirit and how you\nAre an extension of the power\nOr or show it's about the tenacity of the human spirit and how you\nAre an extension of the power\nThat created the whole universe he couldn't access that power

understand that what you're going through is part of\nA your metamorphosis and and sometimes you don't want to say the same in our country right now which seems so divided and so [noise]\nUgly but I have to believe that out of this metamorphosis just like a butterfly this violent metamorphosis\nBeauty will emerge and that's what we watch it on our show every season after season we see these kids who have gone through a lot and they they emerge as great beauties and heroes\nYou know and and the thing about the show is that there's that intimacy and the challenges but ... as you said earlier

actually choked up hearing that a her say those things so lovely you know I've always admired her in fact when [noise]\nWhen she showed up on the cover of life magazine in March of of Nineteen sixty eight at our house I remember a emulating the pose on the cover of that life magazine she's she's on the covers\nEighteen sixty eight at our house I remember a emulating the post on the cover of that

day\nShe gave me the star she presented me with the star in the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this\nPlanet I always felt like the boy who failed or a that was always my goal and that's why drag shapes shifting or wearing all these different hats in show business has always been my goal and I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I just it on her show Grayson Frankie a\nWith a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season of grace and Frank yeah\nWell you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be talking to you a today and we got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't\nWant to answer to that [laughter] 'cause\nYou don't lose it you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know we'll say okay we're guy\nOkay how about this how about ... okay how does this is a pretty easy one how about this one then church wants to know that he'd be interested to know the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influenced how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal has always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of the people behind drag and and tell their stories because it's it's it's a very unique person and personality who's able to ah\nChange themselves and and to die voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important they're still uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who are different every year every season\nIt takes on a a life of its own so we've got a couple\nProduce the show and then we add the queens who were different every year every season and it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag or any part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have changed the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent and drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big questions that the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because uh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is\nI'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept\nThe idea of someone that changing their identity\nWe our whole culture is based on a density of consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is\nAnd drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and that\nSo drag will never be mainstream\nUh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is um we eat a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas\nUm I ... I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind so that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this earth\nI'm a ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we cast our show is the most diverse ... a a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think uh uh this past season without giving anything away ... yeah\nIn television when we cast everybody in fact I think uh this past season without giving anything away ... yeah because I was going to\nI was going to be a good little T who gives a who\nWe have on this show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with a way out so well listen\nYou know we we cash the show based on the criteria is one is charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast the show if you got it Iran\nFrom [laughter] and they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking this question but I just have to know uh [noise]\n'cause I'm a huge ... fan and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that that that you you dropped her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and took the Mattel [laughter] and I\nJust don't think she was just what happened there well\nWe we uh first of all you need and so Rob because ... is almost deals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that\nBut the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner or even as you played the clip of misfit Angie\nShe did one episode and became an in tuned shuttles are so few do um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to say something else that I wanted to ask you about because", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "22"}
