I knew that through my third reading about concussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you\nUh retired players are just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about lowering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together and I'm very short period of time and right\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something um\nChanged about Jews and something couldn't correct don't connect to something here for a second 'cause ... the you really you write about in the book about how\nChanged about choosing somebody couldn't correct well can I just jump in here for a second 'cause ... the you really you write about in the book about how right after that sat crash that did that second hit a Talladega as you were saying like you were ... more emotional less less restrained\nNASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track at two hundred miles an hour\nBut you see in the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me a pack of reporters wanting to ask you about the crash\nHe started talking in your eyes get why any volume picks up and you're faced are turning\nRed and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody is no\nNobody

not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those opinions to myself because they were going to do mean no good bye [noise]\nI'm sharing them in that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and [noise]\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR will enough and and my intentions that is in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport in in that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control it [noise]\nThat was the

director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program and he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for\nA racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on point\nI ... ... it's really great to have you because uh obviously as as Dale writes in the book you're real a key figure in his feelings when the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office when you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes\nWhat did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\nWhile I've seen him I saw Dale twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale ... we actually got they'll better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was very sick with these issues that we commonly see with concussion\nAnd quite honestly I didn't care as much about becoming a race car driver again I I Want to Dale to become a human that felt normal that was the first president for everything and\nAnd I just jump in here though because I mean the to the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems uh all the all the things I hand eye coordination all the things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving a two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life um you know it's a racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar initially saw Dale and\nAnd you know we really identified learned a lot about concussion and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the labyrinth signals coming from and and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with the L and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got them better and and the deal is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nSo uh but Mickey Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what they all rode in the book is that you prescribed both times is very\nAnd I think one thing that surprised me about what they all rode in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very\nVery specific specific regimen of exercises and protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nUh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when a brain is healing from from concussions I\nThat's a common perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identify now that there are six different types of concussions and\nThere's some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated but in details profile of difficulties the way you treat the problems that Dale had is actually through ... training\nAnd so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach or whether the rate regulation or what not but it\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again whereas the opera and single coming from and then matched the right treatment to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a ... event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah well Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nYou didn't actually get all that many phone calls from some drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\nYeah actually that was so interesting I guess you know a\nHearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and look and and just really just be able to contact Mickey had to get a Pittsburgh where he was in and see him\nUm that was\nThink the beginning of the\nReason for writing this book and make you told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's rent or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is

you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that connect uh\nYou know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and that I've made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt\nYou there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Nikki Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nYou are so concerned freaked out really about uh uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve but that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did that and why was up so profound feel\nBad you know he did that on a couple occasions I had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm focusing not ... they weren't
