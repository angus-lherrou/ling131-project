point on David Folkenflik we're exploring the opioid crisis this hour by talking to people most effect by it you can join the conversation what do you find works\nMedication assisted treatment abstinence only in twelve step programs where white hundred for two three to five five between a hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook on point radio\nIn twelve step programs where white hundred for two three eight to five five hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find this on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose though the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to oppose it you've called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor Nuys that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why she for police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most American cities um don't have a department of health right where either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide is the number one source of accidental death and our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or crack cocaine other drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges any human body for heroin and found and all that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said even orphan methadone there's a lot of stigma around um [noise]\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable another won't won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we could take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nUh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at\nOur needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment you wanted to try some of the medication or you'll get a prescription for it and that prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for given orphan\nAnd Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot and we worked very hard in Vermont\nYou can get a prescription for buprenorphine\nAnd Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar ... up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place that mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner in our prison system who needs it\nIt'll say briefly that if you look at that model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post in car sort of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the ... percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully we'll turn of the time\n[noise] um kitten O'Neal would this have helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean I Believe that would ... been incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and Vermont again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue and a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an absence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about some space which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean because in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to thirds its it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm brand and just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when ... was first starting\nYou know I'm Brandon just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when ... was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking methadone or if you're taking to pronouncing laying out really create clean or not so far right\nWe can just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and sell denying people access are making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say to people you know like you can't have this drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think is hard to\nGet it out I if we please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what Kate is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically and if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIs the medicines that we have available to us that reduced uh the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town and the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict\nI used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI'd been on people who are in for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um if you just look at the success rates if anybody spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there is no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality\nIs a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking medicine to write yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nYou know we've been getting fasting and strong response from listeners uh uh as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not choose to have either you post on our website or she's on her Facebook page and wrote addiction as a lifelong bite of a disease that few respect or ... can't be cured bites\nUsed to have

okay I think the police chief from Vermont is right on but I got to tell you if the drug companies providing the medicated assisted medication or pushing that drug as hot as\nPurdue chemicals push the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because the medication is the fact of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like what I've seen over the last ten years\nYou know the the uh pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from a pharmaceutical ... know they're being a flooded throughout the addiction a heroin belt in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people\nThat are stabilized on a on a medication\nAnd then what happens is they are off and then they relapse and die because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot if I Know they they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a crushed fact you know and they got a couple of them and they die now my history I was incarcerated because of my opiate ah dependents\nAnd er I relapsed that day I got out had been read today I'd be dead\nBecause I'm so twenty percent of the population that Iraq has proven that have a addictive um heroin histories die within the first two weeks because of an overdose so\nI'm living with the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing your personal experience and also your expertise on just that makes me want to let you weigh in on a couple things first you heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a an active part of the solution\nConstructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not currently part of the problems or how does that a\nSeat in with your reporting on this [laughter] well um\nIt can in that um you know they just um that had plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose and others and some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a little bit\nAnd make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point\nOthers and some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a very little bit and make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the chief in what's happening in Vermont is that's really unusual I mean my hat is just off to him\nBut in states where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently I mean we have we have already talking you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion\nI mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program\nWe have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so\nNowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live\nUh whether you get this lifesaving treatment or not\nBut we we have a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstruction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachians\nOr you know stretching from the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they once could rely on study jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a vital sign was being pushed to well what\nWe really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and so go socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked them in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up and he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a drawer and want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in\nLee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard at

data from the CDC the seemingly ... trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be bending and the right direction [noise] telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare

point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual ... before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in our duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders that wanna wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like mayor Weinberger here in
