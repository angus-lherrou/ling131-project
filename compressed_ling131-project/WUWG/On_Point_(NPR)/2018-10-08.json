today from the studios of WHYY in Pennsylvania because we are talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact it's had on

today by Lindsey lives our species the multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for\nAnd about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by Lindsey lives our species a multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crossroads media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court a and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino did Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a Lindsey he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruling a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere's nothing in Pennsylvania Constitution says and not have to be fair wherever fair me that he just took it upon themselves as say fairness means [noise] you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was the one analyst called the Democrats dream map\nSo it was a it was just said hey here's a take it unconstitutional taking of power by the [noise]\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives ... let me just get a a a some impressions hear from you because first of all when to Georgia talks about\nNew map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out yes I'm so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second uh the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map\nDeprived Pennsylvania voters of the right to free and equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislatures that OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these\nUm these contingencies of different groups handing in math and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now and they were supposed to agree on a new about the ... yes governor was supposed to approve 'em the map that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't happen first of all the legislation\nBe on a new about the could it yes governor was supposed to approve 'em the map that the legislature um came up with it didn't happen I didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislator leaders do that was never passed by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court and in all fairness to both sides of Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even if the legislature could've come up with a map when when I met and they went back to\nThis a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which has never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution defines it\nThere yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've course had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but the Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading lovely ...\nWell I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm\nSo who are ultimately making that decision\nThat's exactly right I mean they've ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and I'm going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in federal court that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican a to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now on that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats you know need to pick up some twenty somethings seats and they're looking for any\nI mean is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now on that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nYou know the reason why I wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering will we get\nMore moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper polarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there or do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and and here's what some voters even the ... valley told us about what they see what\nFor the church and uh there's\nPumpkin pastry and pulled pork on the table at the ... United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty Nothstein bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled valve reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the ruins a volunteer has set up a life size cut out of President Trump\nGiving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet me as a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge to retire this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nIs old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight point Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterm\nLike the valley is a microcosm of the United states we Dog Democrats to Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we've always heard about it and why Rogers\nCalls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate want a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics no Stein also advocates for strict term limits but he falls in line with the ... on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights\nAlso advocates for strict term limits but he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act new stain is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and\nGreet he's not a pie in the sky conservative people who are just the ideologues and he was not an ideologue he is a working man\nAsk Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her newly balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists\nAt how Georgia's elections are run tomorrow on MORNING edition and all things considered [noise]\nSupport for TB comes from you our listeners\nAnd Callaway resort in gardens Georgia's authentic outdoor escape offering to championship golf courses the scenic lick the course and the mountain view course\nTwelve time hosted the PGA Buick challenge Moritz Callaway Gardens dot com and Clark Atlanta University radio presenting world renowned jazz vocalist Bobby McFerrin in his ... group boisterous to Atlanta one night only friday November thirtieth eight PM meta something the whole tickets to ticket master dot com\nJeremy hops in the conflict in Yemen has turned into a proxy war involving Saudi Arabia the U.S Iran and others it's also one of the world's great humanitarian crises with more than twenty two million people meeting aid David Miliband heads the international Rescue Committee we'll speak with him on here now\nFrom noon until one eighty point five maybe\nYou can also listen live online at TPP news\nDot org\n\nSupport for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the New England or rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever the day has in store the new fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com [noise] and then gauge working to make higher education more affordable with us\nThe day has in dorms then you fall collection is on view\nAnd Charles River apparel dot com and sending to working to make higher education more affordable with us engage unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and study guides then gauge unlimited C.

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call\nUm I I'm from uh the eleventh district and Pennsylvania just king is running [noise] and um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for George Scott any a tense district\nAnd I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the the ... district but I'm the same time Slovenia move further and Mr Xi and make it more fair\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical [noise]\nA procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to topple after the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties boundaries or\nIt's a good question Jason and I mean ... even phones issue for a long time what do you think\nYeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know ... a congressional districts need to be ... compact they need to be contiguous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part of it\nYou know ... a congressional districts need to be ... compact they need to be continuous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these new till ... that need to be considered before part is concerned but you know the court can go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes to part is and so there's it's vague but there there are some guidelines that yeah at the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of distraction outdoors or politics always going to be a part of this process\nI don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both try to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better if gerrymandering\nBecause of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level you know what I said not the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the other one's\nStill is is that the rules for the algorithm and when I was think computers can do a better let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I live in northern Sonoma County up to Akron, Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over and took the northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman\nYes the main things that go ahead and make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten and the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats but that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six\nSixty three house seats but that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be offers thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state\nThat has a huge difference on writing the laws are each day you know that govern drinking as exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election\nWas huge not just in terms of the\nBringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that Iran's that\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to take you back on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered mats in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate and the the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nAnd by the Democrats would do a ... that's being nonpartisan to but I Know you're not parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah so this is not partisan book you already will do that well\nThat's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it on a there have they have done here in\nPennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm ... but the point is is that is there a way\nTo come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to let me let me play for you I'm a a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the ... the chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second\nHe poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best\nIndependents citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw lines and\nSaturday heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation patrols party political mapped out all over the country Democrats and drawing maps of their favors in other states like Maryland so [noise] you know this is nonsense which part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair district being planned they call them to take back the rational and they've done it here in Pennsylvania\nBut bell to Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair children's lives are so he ... he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps\nBut there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have to say I love that um operatic music behind found in Columbus Day festival here in Philadelphia it can\nBe there to south Philly um so you know a a group a in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know uh they they they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interest to form this commission as you pointed out", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
