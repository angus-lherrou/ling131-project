leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee a nonprofit organization led by use of color\nOr that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice\n... welcomed on point\nHi David thank you for having me\nFirst let's start with you a George ... is from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about uh our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was him talking about star code switching I find that often for me because I Do I Do walk he was confident I go to a like a cool how out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\n[noise] well um so I went to in the air or not in the ... budget on lock it because that's where I live [noise] mhm well when I started a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame than me going from\nBeing around people all day who lived in ... just like me now coming here to people who look completely different and had different lingo and different things than I Am so I remember\nI'm coming here to people who look completely different and had different lingo and different things and I have\nSo I remembered my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or they'll use starting playing and people would not understand what I meant by sanctioning word or I Would just feel different for talking last proper than they did so I kind of get started teaching myself that when I met or I talk proper\nUse proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk how I feel comfortable talking and youth slang that my family and friends I used to\nYou know there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a star Carter is a ... played by the actor a man's western ... she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is ... mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nDie in this scene as I start enters William since she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nAnd I said well world\nAnd I got to keep it separate the one I'm here\nI'm Sorry version to\nMean slipping a switch in my brain Williams starred doesn't play\nRapper was saying she doesn't\nEven for my friends\nPlaying makes me you know\nCan Kay is that what you're talking about is there to get back to what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know do you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburb when I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks them now you have to act is completely different and so because of the areas where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are\nBlack thing these words and acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happen subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth\nYou can only mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that and so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both from I\nMostly white communities and mostly populated with well actually it it is the way I spoke the way I talked we address the way I act it was completely different I definitely can relate to the idea of code switching\nLooks at how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around having to say consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway um I\nThink it's definitely an extra burden that we have because from black people it's this idea of a double identity there'll be always have to say is this the [noise]\nThe majors you want to go in there for ... you know what I'm Sorry okay go ahead for you know he's trying to write a letter written I [laughter]\nI um I definitely think that\nIt's way more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always faced with having to fight so many negative stereotypes it's already a protein that's in the first place I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learning about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by\nPeople aren't educated they miss their that their head they own everywhere and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like\nSo what do I have to cook for myself to to seem like I can make it so I think\nCode switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and saw her face are trying to be ourselves but then also face on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe ideal of perfection other people's eyes uh we are\nTo be trusted you have a different take on a um\nI agree on that one Minnesota situations like that and I have like a job interview or something oh put on a voice like not three like Bob ... voice [laughter] that's very um\nGet back on the back to me that is true of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father of a stark harder in the opening scene about how important must be proud of being black in at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black\nIn the opening scene about how important must be proud of being black in at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls needed to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials teachers did you ever receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes ah received a talk like that when I was younger

the seventies to be honest with\nYou what's gotten worse and Michael\n... the the the racial profiling and the tension between the rate that I mean look we got we got Donald Trump elected to the attitude and the mentality of\nWhat a state of mind and you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws in check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile if they're on the police force today\nThank you so much for your prospect Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it and thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\nIf he's in her corner but a certain point he says door you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that\nThe on the police force basically ... he's in her corner but a certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about a ... how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's a respect we need to respect for both both sides um\nWhen I was Thirteen I had a experience would stop and frisk and ... like to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like three or four police can you tell me about\nCan reach us can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like\nOh it was like what happened it was scary I was walking around my block\nAnd I'll go and build it to build and trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me to start or like kind of walking fast because that was kinda scary and um they called me around the corner and they start to check my and go to see if I had drugs or anything\nAnd I had twenty dollars because at my parents and handle pockets and I would just shaking the whole time and they say well you scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time a ... like Cruz by me I always like shake up\nThere yeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and a half for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among people who make policies and laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kinda takes away from the human element right like this that he acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nAnd the same neighborhood for ... years circus I growing relationships with them and just not have a new place or say every month or week\nIt was just started growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and think that that should happen they ship place police officers and the same neighborhood\nThere had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has an a you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood matrix yes there\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a

white she called the police and has since apologized but your mind his mother told good morning America that lake like dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo hard because I played the on my mind\nI Can't I Can't think nothing but so\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah I certainly was devastated for him because\nEven after walking away he was pointing to\nPatrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and saying mommy are they here to take you away from\nCaroline how much uh uh is this idea of living well black uh uh uh we've heard instances where a man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he lived there as well how much does this affect kind of your your daily rhythms of your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you look out of your near you see a police officer and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong\nAnd I'm just to add I'm listening to the video and the incident with the little boy it very much reminding me of the situation with and the two\nAnd how that affected him he had no idea what he had done wrong and added to the little boy that it just happened to and\nThey now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something bad is going to happen to him at such a young age and now he's going to grow up and have that carrying around him so good\nGoing up black and living up living in this situation create a constant um\nAmount of fear on you in a constant amount of worry anxiety and she got to carry around because you never know what it's going to happen or what a small move is gonna um how ... what was going to affect you it affect your life in the long run itself\nIn the movie the heat you give stark ... as I said earlier played
