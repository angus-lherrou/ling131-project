I mean the everything that came out we were in the last couple of years is not like that right Amazon warehouses are not like that um\n... when he mentioned I'm working in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple of years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he offered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in his company\nAnd I'm Sorry [laughter] and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I call it that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of dystopian stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well anyway let me just ask you briefly a are we ... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the ultra big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's ... he was saying that he's not obviously not every company is going this way is is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead absolutely\nThere definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nIn this age of knowledge work um and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nYou know we have a lot again it's just it's always a little bit of the bitter with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic\nAnd out of it isn't as I got on it though because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right exact not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor's that's that's delivered that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down most quickly in order to\nA massage a profit for that quarter I just cut a workforce they don't make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the essence of a company or the workers themselves so my question is new to you India is that ... in trying to shift perspective a little here\nFor for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers to empower them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing yeah\nI think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and intention ... kind of the two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male chip as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing\nStart ups um I think it's about alternative ways\nAnd how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share it's a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like a again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate and the success of that company as well so everyone is invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top um I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team or or just say multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by the time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like such as long as they were like yeah it's the gold on how you get out of your life now no uh there are a lot more calls you want to get to hear but then you wake up from you and what you're hearing from India", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "25"}
