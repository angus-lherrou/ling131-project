transracial adoption and and her search for her identity and what difference it made to her when she actually sought out the truth of the story of her\nBiological family where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk uh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life\n[laughter] um but but there's just the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nA sense that you you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt a lot okay ... yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of ... of adopted children lined you but\nKind of end yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent\nMyself not opened up of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool\nKit and it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have\nA as as a as a child of a different race I mean thinking about this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just\nThings I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed is to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way of information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with him about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time and ask many questions just nobody really was telling them either some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how your answer this question or\nTalk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to to to have those conversations I think okay now\nSo I can hear a fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about was something ... difficult enough to handle 'em or no you know what to do with how to come through that\nIn addition to that ... was there was there all along and that you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an empty nest or something that you felt that needed to be filled because of\nYou know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're compulsion as you saw it with your parents\nIn more an empty nest or something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're compulsion as you saw it with your parents [noise]\nYeah I think it was it wasn't so much an empty necessarily I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did kingly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly\nUm I in a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable\nUm I don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships and great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt that I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this as guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be an can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in both my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced\nThat I would've eventually search no matter what you know I it's not something I have a for a month or two I certainly been curious I wondered um I had gotten a little bit of information that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names no addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final push I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history in my family history and my mother's pregnancies\nStaying at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birds [noise]\nUm and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and I don't know why I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me I was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family that I was really scared and also\nI I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions only become far more acute when there's so many on answered a issues in in the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm
