not allowed to roam grow and explore unfettered no rules and no requirements know boring routines that can kill a child's love of learning\nLet's call them on schooling kind of like a super size

Boston College cofounder\nAnd president of the nonprofit alliance for self directed education and the author of free to learn\nA new Peter great I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps success is based on how self directed a child is [noise]\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they want\nAll day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\n[noise] but you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter]\nSo this issue of self directed what is it being to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever seen a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around without their what's new what can I learn about\nThinking of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch [noise]\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them so on schooling is there water if we just left them continue to do that and that of put them away where their own questions don't count anymore\nWhere their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school what kinds of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because\nWe've taken away the basic ...\nSchool and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness so they have the ability if I may\nJust have been here for a second I I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some I don't know some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a myth quote okay I tried to get them to change that [laughter] and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quote [noise]\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct construction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of ... and [noise]\nAh I have yet to see a child who's been as self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read at very different ages right\nHere's why I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid [noise]\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't [noise]\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how\nGovernment works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh you know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of setting them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning a car they learning at in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights Hemenway lecture to them about civics 'cause that real civics lesson or is a better civics\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights Hemenway lecture to them about civics cars that are real civics lesson or is a better civics lesson to say\nHey you're grown up in a democracy here growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own lives you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path unhappiness isn't that a better civics lesson than a lecture on it you are living yet\nYou are limited in what in what though that that you'll have ultimate the total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nYou know something yes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society\nThey are learning how to live no society and it's also not the case that there nobody is totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or school learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratic way there are lots of rules you can't let her you care if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules and isn't that a better civics lesson\n... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they are totally self directed\nWell for me I I question what the word introduced me in in this context because\nIntroducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed on schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so the idea that these things will not be\nIntroduced or seen are filled is something that\nI don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAt its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready and whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happened at the playground a there's issues of race that happen everywhere\nPolitics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground or there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to\nGoing to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge into making sure that their identity is affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions\nThat create inclusion and diversity and equity so that has nothing to do with school\nWell a

I. capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control [noise] you know the truth of the matter ailing\nTerror and my heart and later as there is this guy\nI give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research that just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout almost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had\nThe history of humanity throughout almost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had\nHas so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on\nBut here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly learn and who's to decide what's most important for any given child\nWe want people to grow up learning different aspects of that knowledge why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and information\nThat schools have decided that the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else maybe we'll\nNever have been driving that of the\nMatter is that your child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my ... my research shows is that the graduate so self directed education are doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting jobs\nLet me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nOf first START I appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask one of the characters to come out of the children for the parents do we really want a society\nIn which we are the children are simply the property of their parents when there's a growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti of you know clearly racist kinds of things and I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best for their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now\nAnd ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing the situations that are that we're putting parents and so that's my first my first response the second is\nUm we have to ask do we want a simply to have a society and rich\nMy first response second is we have to ask do we want simply to have a society in which children are simply she\nTurns having no responsibility whatsoever [noise] larger society what can we do to make it more certain that the vast majority of children will go to schools actually you have to kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie theater one right\nWell Michael let me let that Peter Graham illegal responded that Peter go ahead that I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and it's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to let me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problems\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and it works very well for their children\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "30"}
