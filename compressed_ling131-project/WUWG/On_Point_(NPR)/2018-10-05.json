LA Kemper Emmy nominated starve the Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right there you heard the show's theme song A L e a\nK Schmidt it was as you say in your book and rightly so it is\nA crazy pitch of a series or just you know the two sentences tell us the set up of of of what can be Schmidt is and how she writes in her ... ... ... ... ... where she is when she arrives at our television it's\nInsane so she said the backstory of ... is that she was kidnapped\nWhen she was fourteen years old on health underground in a bunker for Fifteen Years and then rescued by the FBI or where she is a brought back into the world and decides to make a new start for herself and of course New York city\nThat we start so I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it ... um [noise] I certainly thought when I heard the idea for the show that someone\nSomewhere with ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the set up for an extremely tough tough drama you know you could imagine HBO tree you know the guys who did the wire doing this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet at ... at ... Robert Carlin and Tina Fey made it into a an extremely funny show\nSo tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the sets the your outfits like everything is incredibly bright almost passed outright and you could not be ... you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as a kid in character yeah but you could not be basically a more default sunny reactor\nI Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girlish she wears bright pink pastel pants much too might like LA's ... cause I don't I don't like us\nBut we're in ... I think that she was floral shirt she wears jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and why at the same time she is this fierce tenacious warrior who is ...\nShe wears jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and yet at the same time she is this fierce tenacious warrior who has been through something ... and I'm so difficult that I Can't\nActually imagine what that must have been like and yet he continues to choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that sort of capacity or or if you have a force to develop it during you know at a test\nLike the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah uh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\nAre ... and friend Titus a tries to give her a goodbye hug on the first day of school\nAnd bears are very tight and the other on the ticket and it'll be\nSomeday when you're a black man you have a candidate drinks he liked it [noise]\nGuy [laughter]\nTruly truly funny a and you know\nIn Deering and loving of the same time there's an undercurrent of bleak it in all this stuff how do you how do you look at this rather dark comedy with such cheerful knows\nI don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as a very serious as the one\nUm that can meet the the the tortured that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because of bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it isn't the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's ... it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know ... ... fine and sunny one moment and then the horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so I don't know that I went abroad and so I'm like what a pro flex life but it does\nWell so you this obviously show created by Tina Fey moved on initially for NBC Weaver was as a Robert ... who's the head of entertainment she was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this right I\nI don't and I I think\nThis is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this\nAnd I do and I I thankfully don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yeah it was originally slated to be on NBC and again it you know I I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl was went underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus is sending her off to school because she didn't get to complete high school when there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up until ... twelve or something you know\nI'm alarmed because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I I think we have gone on Instagram before you honestly honestly where you know I'm I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive about certain things because she has been her her adolescence stunted its its Arrested Development and she's coming out\nUm as a [noise] twenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life\nNever done thank you but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\nI I wouldn't say that you had on address but you certainly come into contact with a lot of issues that people are are working through in thinking about\nA couple of episodes I'm thinking about in particular here's a clip from season for of unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and you can hear it can be arguing with friend he's the leader of a men's rights group called the Innocence Project played by Bobby ...\nFemales have it's so easy way please come when your body makes milk it's beautiful well as a woman I can tell you it easy breezy beautiful girl\nSuicide attacker he has all I've been a junior salesmen uh Darryl bridal for Fifteen Years I've seen what females truly are full you care about the ring dress and not\nEveryone was because the women who come in here are engaged in their mouth\nAnd making a point he's making a very good ... other episode a co workers accuse your character a sexual ...\nAnd making a point he's making a very good ... relatives while other episode of\nCoworkers accuse your character a of sexual harassment Kimmy Schmidt sexual harassment in the workplace in this scene you'll hear can be attempting to soften the blow of firing an employee named ... here she touches his shoulders and then I could you not she dropped her parents in an attempt to demonstrate\nHer own humiliation in the moments\nLike you could hear I\nLike the new every day\nMaybe [noise] work isn't the best place for that\nMaybe our friendship belong in the Knight

I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\nToo but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from reporters data yet along these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions like hopefully some of the ... meter than others\nBut I I think that is that when bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference on what happens\nIs that is like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay we are so women can be funny but I have ... being honest\nI I never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was based on the box office success and bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you can make\nA ... a very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it why are you talking about yeah they always been funny\nAnd he went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who knows the noted British and intentional controversial as she actually wrote this thing for Vanity Fair saying essentially obviously women are not fun and they don't need to be a war that's something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in in two thousand so that's still a thing\nNever encountered that and I know some women have an in an improv I think and I said it\nFor things I mean in the two thousands would that's still a thing\nThat I never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv I think and I said it did a lot of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen if the white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from\nUh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed that the movie was funny and I thought get out of my inbox because it's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised many furious because by you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue that someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\n... on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money that yes [laughter]\nSometimes you work with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig\nOr what did you what ... what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of think publicly tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians we'd be like you know you got to be tough to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\nThat what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Tina Fey or just by watching her because that women", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "05"}
