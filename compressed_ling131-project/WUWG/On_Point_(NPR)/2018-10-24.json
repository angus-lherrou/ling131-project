N. F. treaty\nWith Russia China was and they all say let's really get a lot of us develop those\nIt Russia's doing it doing it and we're hearing today agreement don't accept\nSo president Donald Trump they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China and the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nAppears that national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met Russian President butter butter my ... and both said there's just one point on wished Russia and the U.S agreed\nThat other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world aren't restricted by the IMF it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral was the missile related treaty in a multi polar\nI think on this latter point of the more complicated global a strategic environment for something that concerns the Russians a very substantial and we talked about\n... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton say\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in a world of our power and might\nA world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states he wants a world where there were no restraints whatsoever on US military for freedom of action you seem sort of convinced\nA Donald Trump to have to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world but just you if you take down this treaty which is working which is in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nUh the the us and Soviet arsons not rushing arsenals by over fifty percent and if you take\nOr get list is the start treaty that had reduced\nUh the the us and Soviet arsons not rushing arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take and that will then toppled that seems to be his goal and then you put at risk the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world that\nIs a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal um the ... for it to play a bigger role in the ... in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's\nAnd and it talks about these exact risk that that's a ... of Russia or China of a non uh a non bilateral world here and that in order to counter or these other countries that are\nThat are at hand singing modernizing their nuclear arsenals that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same thing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the I. N. F. though\nYou say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand that how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons is inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more than a thousands of nuclear weapons are already have\nAnd in this case the Baltimore is pulling out an old trek he's he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with friday a logical grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the Russians who are modified and existing weapon to give a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites in European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we'd been detecting Mrs about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently in arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't like repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing them to do whatever you want now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the there is a really bad part it's unlikely that we can match\nBut every once now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the during the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it of course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that watch them from European ally wants them that's why you're seeing how of complaint from France from\nFrom Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security\nNo one needs a new arms race says the foreign minister of the European Union\nAmong among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is fighting an arms race that was already brewing as both the U.S and Russia are building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe but once again be the battle ground\nFor these two nuclear giants as they battle\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end of the INS treaty I mean I'm seeing here the stigma Gabriel who just stepped down in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall it um but as one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the things that led to a\nThe the INS to begin with that just hurts you and I know you have a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more uh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focus joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ...

fourth is welcome to you\nThank you magnify great to be here so I'm very eager to hear your take on this given your experience here do you think the Trump Administration is a ... is doing is on the right track here in terms of its desire to pull out of the INS\nWell ... unfortunately I don't really see\nA better option right now because the Russians essentially put our back to the wall this is really like going back to Nineteen eighty seven where\nActually our European allies the Germans asked us\nTo step in and counter the Russian short short range or medium range missiles that were deployed and threatening Europe at the time with our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so I think\nAnd threatening Europe at the time with our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so\nI think largely in a way that he was able to use it to negotiate the Russians out of their own missiles and that's how we got the intermediate nuclear forces treaty and I having been in the administration [laughter]\nI Know that we tried very hard to confront the Russians to convince the Russians um to do what we could using words to deter them from continuing to violate the agreement but they did not stop\n'em as you noted in the beginning this has been public since two thousand fourteen I'm the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified openly that the Russians have deployed this capability these missiles and\nSo what are we going to do I think that for the U.S government the best option unfortunately at this point is to do what we did an eighty seven which is to threaten to counter so the burglars burglar to us\nSupport for CPB comes from

Cirincione joined us as well he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution and Evelyn and Joe if I may we've had a lot of patient callers waiting so let me just get to some of them right now Calvin\nIs calling from Charleston, Missouri Kelvin you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a former well military I'm veteran enough Thirty Years' old African American and um as far as the U.S goes as far as our our military and our nuclear arms and basically are on\nThe way President Trump went about it is not necessarily the right way but I Do think he's going to go right I'm as your first guest band you know about up he\nWell he ... he went to a lot of people for too long and a lot of the the President Trump has done has shown no look no longer take this role on the global stage you all for it though but\nInstead of the nation that is or Mike lack of better words I think we've been to sleep in the military and she says it's best to stay on guard all the way because when you fall asleep at the yearly attacks or\nA bit of work I think we've been fleet military she chose to stay on guard all the way because when you fall asleep that we usually attacked or like Russia's going I think he's going right the we can be as we watch as far as our allies are by nature you know we\nYou know we're hiring a bald Russia's\nKelvin was taken back through there and thank you so much for your call let's go to Margaret who's calling from Hayes, Virginia Margaret you're on the air\n[noise] Hi thanks for taking my call I find the idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear\nA treaty buying and a logic to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons [noise] it's just going to make the safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing the number is going to make the world and they say are we have enough to destroy the many times over already it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Ellen far just how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to I'm Cal than if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be\nFrom with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt but that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies with regard to Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy a which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that\n... new turn back to here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we we will return to it but China has been lurking here a as a major part\nUh we we can also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and ... we will return to it but China has been lurking here or a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the INS here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... that the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to deploy a strategic weaponry in the in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier\nBecause of this and that that's putting us tease Calvinist term behind the eight ball in Asia\nBut you always have to be very careful when you hear people who want new nuclear weapons in the language they use so John Bolton says you know an out outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained\nAnd so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're being where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us or as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nThat is to about a several hundred times more weapons than you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into this trap\nOf nuclear war planters just planners who who see this and some kind of board game where you have to match piece by piece on China what they're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a an air force that can reach beyond us borders\nThey have new for now [laughter] okay for now they they they have\nA nuclear weapons are up about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like Korea like won a and like the United states they have about forty that could reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us in building those but we have to see based\nMissile which them just\nWeapons that can reach them just fine we have strategic submarines the crowd the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can hit them for every one that they have they can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other uh underlined reality about there's\n... there's nobody in now one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want the U.S part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not ...\nAnd one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said that they do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want a mattress\nWill Evelyn first is a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here it's worthy of of ... different discussion here further discussion because\nAnd I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to Joe's point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a de overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\nWell I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planners so I that's a little bit out of my\nWeek to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "24"}
