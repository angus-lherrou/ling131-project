I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're into this you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks\nAnd I she found he ... you get so busy surviving you know use this job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy days as a lone survivor to look up to yourself and again you know when we're now is the crew you know when were filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of has to be needed you know putting out shelters are getting a fog and someone else to be needed just to put a foot still not what you'd do you know the bow drill the everything on the right to do so much that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through to\nThe days on All right it was just doing ... and if you collect firewood repairing the setting snake as doing that\nYou know I just remember that save training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing to the doctor and the sea collected firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that and by the end is how you\nSaw it on your shoulders and then it's a mental ... you're going to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people in survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they are doing to think about ... planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on your own I I think it's three times out of it when you go one other buddy with you\nThere there's one more thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response to me 'cause I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on TV released survived survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly mace to spending three hours trying to lie to five ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the ...\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this all ... hours and hours settings snags and all of a say that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know I guess editor Dana ... bit of music and ... book has got a fog guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just as his wife that rod is still the show survivor of summed up three was never give up or what about that too nasty that spirit\nAnd he might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nGetting something wrong before you get success and that's why the\nRule it's always got to that do get the determine you know Saturday that the Berlin the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for by the way to rabbits for the people\nThat's got to be no one day he loves food team found in the ... yeah I I'm not saying that Seventy so we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... like string weight loss\nI learned to leave with nothing no camera crews joining than they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... like stream white law said and that is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous is very on romantic reality of survived was great well\nSpeaking of the the glamorous part of survival and do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round plastic question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation somebody will situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind to subtract needs needs some attention yeah I mean they desperately to hear about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff and I saw\nUm found the holy ... you're not getting the land ... by the failures that and your next time I got ... beach will die any that want to get\nIt right so I get ... wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super ... do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and then ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't need to write you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one side great film you know the end of the line of the Alaskan ... had a baby coming on you I got our own ready to get it wrong ones out there\nYeah by the way if you haven't heard from folks have already Jon Krakauer as original book as amazing Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\nHey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress of a good thing she's going to snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survive is all about that in a spirit the out\nShe and the the the little tweak of an actress of a good thing she's going to snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survive is all about that in a spirit the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on our team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is all about spirit and ... to nasty impulsivity [noise]\nUm and I see some of them have the guns the guy with the you know that if it was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Wednesday and on Twitter or sorry on our website says beer can you do
