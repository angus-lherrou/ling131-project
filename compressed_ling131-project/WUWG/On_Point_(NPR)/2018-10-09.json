make in order to conquer the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no roads that effort is captured in the documentary free solo which was directed by Elizabeth ties are Sally and Jimmy chain and alec tunneled\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nI mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement and exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know from my new for pitch one was a very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the picture I could just count on myself to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then it also climbed the whole the whole face so many times that I kinda just remembered most of it\nUm they do but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay [laughter] but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense of ... when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental arm or what is\nThat I I actually um I actually don't call them and learners on in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quote in something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut I'm actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free cell oh cap was to sort of get past that I think because I feel like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like is it something that's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like shield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap I get it it's just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I am and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus inward that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film I now two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable in that\nYeah two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining techniques and eventually it took a long time to show comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I'd been dreaming about it and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nTake a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical preparation and I'm feet of climbing out kept but\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so Lewis many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climbers Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the deaths of the world's best free solar climber is\nThink everybody who is made for ... a big part of their life\nWith a tiny red so called free solar climbing mount past week at the age of fifty two\nWe're starting to sort of ... and then have us climate show on Larry\nShow was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago there were seeing was climbing a new somebody valley body was found Saturday morning\nOr see climate as usual alone without world most people that are pushing the limits\nOr that they have this mentality of\nWhatever happens happens\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean it just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing was no ropes that has really that really drew you in [noise]\nAh yeah well\nThe good question um I mean basically you know I mean so not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes free cell and can mean scrambling a beautiful ridge in the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for real plus climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an anti social youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the the feeling of freedom to speed or the efficiency I mean there's certain joy in in climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing and stole a small fraction of of my normal climbing big you know it's\nA crime all styles all you know every\nWe're free sewing and stole a small fraction of of my normal climbing there you know it's a crime all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing in and free zone has always sort of represented this this extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's [laughter] a tolerance for risk right I mean yeah\nYou don't know I I totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climbing to me as well even though it's only a small part of where I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant and a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is it what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads I mean is it is a film that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\n... I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's laugh okay because I mean a a a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know and on and in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was thrilling I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better at and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even lie like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind and body\nFeeling of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone is seeking out slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly harder than what you've done before so you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit of butter or what you do\nBut of course with free sewing though the cost of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is ... perhaps I Hope not but they never to blend\nI mean we were all facing another boy and I mean we're all going to die I'm I'm trying my best not to die climbing are very much want to move to old age and have a family and all that but\nNumber one I mean we're all gonna die ... I'm trying my best not to crime and you know very much want to move to old age of family and all that but um no I mean I I I don't\nKnow just keep pushing middle for for dark climbing on so long ago\nWell let me let me just reiterate nobody wants to [laughter]\nBut um we get some calls in here because we got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex uh we're speaking with Alex on old he is a professional rock climber a best known\nSupport for G.

is documented in a new movie free solo which is directed by Elizabeth chai far Sally and\nJamie chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor dean Joseph there who did that MRI skin of your brain started talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know that the shape in response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particular um yeah I mean in general I I was a strong sense of I mean I Am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first upscale yeah and um and to take away to me was basically just you know practice that over time you can do something to talk of the banks and that was very much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time it was next year from I heard that she was at a one of the premier is for for free so I Would have been good to see her rather than the other one in Charlotte they're more extra for\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you guys back in touch here I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this uh you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and persevere and says well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh\nAnd they just see it as like oh well your brain's defectors obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it I mean I've always heard it as as you know we're with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know and so I suppose it's a little bit open a new\nBut one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a colleague wants to talk to you about exactly that's\nOther people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call or who wants to a collie wants to talk to you about exactly that so let's go to Gary is calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\n[laughter] I I like\nUm you know it's one thing to to watch you prepare to go through you know there's regular on the wall where you are in there for every movement but\nThere's also the aspect of family and loved ones I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you prepare um before going out of one of these big feet wide you know kept a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're\nYou know in the midst of a risk multi thousand for them\nYou know I mean that does not is probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it out because in a lot of ways free sewing is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis always sort of argue that ah that I could I could have both you know I can have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level I just needed to to balance it properly I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationships\n[laughter] well I mean as scarce was asking though in the middle of a big climb I mean well let's talk about your al ... ascent on audio to did you think of her or is it was you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the harder sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing the moves that just performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners [laughter]\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free souls or cap I spent you know maybe five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nThe I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend [laughter] you know when I'm finished\n[laughter] well I mean ... as you write in a free so does the movie does explore um your relationship with sunny McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you know a ... factor her into your decisions about free cell look\nIt because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you how are you factor her into your decisions about free solo climbing\nOne like I Want to have in mind compression having I've oh I'm going to die like minds on you know what we want to do while we're hearing a time when people die\nFeel like I Want in a way\nWhen you tell a good campaign\nRussia I'm going to be on putting in a patient actually changing you actually make decisions having\nHad some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan and like you obviously have to do what was going on out\nWest to me I can you do you see that as an obligation now\n[laughter] but I\nAppreciate your your concerns I have a you know I respect that but I Know what your job or you know\nIs that true Alex you still feel obligated to maximize your lifespan here\nKind of hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have a boat struggled through the whole film there there is some restrictions that are all cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on ... or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else\nUm I you know I don't want to die climate like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know a from if I'm thinking about there's no what I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah\nBut but also I mean that that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently or cap for maybe the seven proceed in years and so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean we've been in a great relationship for three years and I was you know finish this big climb and so\nYou know moving forward them I'm sure the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially potential and also sure really sure potentially a well I'm sure it would be different and yeah I'm sure it would be different All right I don't know which way to go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air how\nHow does how you're doing a ... currently Alex you have the uh the mutant climber brain so\nYeah Hi greetings how're you doing a ... apparently Alex you have the uh the mutant climber brain so congratulations [noise] I'm a I'm a climber I've\nI did to various things from the early seventies and climbing my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower in Wyoming um which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter]\nUm so you know you you are a Superman and totally insane\nBut when I was there a there was just this kid who is tree sewing it and you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier in a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop importing protection which was really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and uh\nYou know and I I was I was a ... you know the TV reporter I'd done documentaries and uh I really want to do to documentary on this guy
