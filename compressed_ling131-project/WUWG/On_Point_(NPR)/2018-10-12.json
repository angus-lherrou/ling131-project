find us on Facebook at on point radio my guest this hour Wendy ... of the Brennan Center for justice at NYU and Dale ... of the ACLU\nOr you know the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years of late as an activist registering residents devote proponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state and I think it was a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting right at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appeared Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she's accused her of prominent blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nChallenge is this process called exact match\nAnd we've been fighting on the sets twenty fourteen\nWhat happens is he a hyphen in your last name have been difficult spelling head anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason to not processor registration hand that means that fifty three thousand Georgia is currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and say we're deeply worried that fifty three thousand people per cent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\n[noise] uh Dale hotel me uh what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge oh I'd like to hear it handles someone like I'm Brian Kemp but I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering are actually the people who they\nClaimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like a missing hyphen or the transportation of two letters on a someone entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think is the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote\nIn November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular balance but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged I'd like to take a call now\nProvisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular balance but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged I'd like to take a call now from awake cross Georgia John go ahead you're on the air\nYeah as I was calling I'm about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license the information and to get your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credits that the people that you're saying are being disenfranchised um have that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThank you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nOh heck you for taking my call yesterday who what\nBothers me is and it's rarely discuss is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied to serious restrictions to access to the polls\nEither reducing the polling places polling time um when they're clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in up in Wisconsin [noise] so it's not just about ... it seems to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's about reducing people's um rights civil\nThank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state for the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters\nHad been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nIt was great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYes sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to ah to to having voters on the roles\nWell David we don't teach in every eligible US citizen this resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and have a photo lab day\nAnd we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are accommodating whenever that occurs\nAnd we did our six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as I have in our border registrars office opened each and every day to courthouses open and all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events in activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity\nI think and we visit festivals events in activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Would also tell you that in the rare instances where people say\nHey I Can't get to the ... office\nBecause my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit locations because it's not convenient or I don't go to the events were festivals in lieu of rare occasion that has happened David we've gone to people's homes\nAnd we have given them federal law days in their homes and we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last three years and then much in twenty three days that I've had the privilege to be Alabama's soaked through state\nWe've registered one million Ninety five thousand a hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama are unprecedented and unparalleled in the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easier to vote and hard to ... if you needed a day when you open a bank account if needed a day when you go to the movie if you need an odd day when you buy a six pack of beer\nOr if you buy a pack of cigarettes then you'd rather be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have enough to participate in our democratic Republican is a vote\nI Want to take a really a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I've Sharon on the line churns share your thoughts on this\nHi thank you for taking my call man in Louisiana you've had to show on I have an id with your voter registration um for all the years we've been here which is over twenty\nHowever the the ID now has changed you have to have a real id to vote and the ... id is requires you to a show a birth certificate Social Security card and to um put an end to to document\nUm but they don't tell you you need that you find out about the real ID until you go and get your driver's license renewed it so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed but for the next time your vote and you want\nThere's like ... you're not in the schedule and get your driver's license renewed but for the next time your vote and he won't realize you need a ... ... and ah you want yeah well I\nThink your next electioneering thank you so much for that I appreciate that John Merrill your sucker he stayed in Alabama ... some of the specifics and interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless different David is serve it\nTo remember that they vary from state to state I mean we have ten different elements that can be attained to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or a non driver id or the free Alabama voter id that we give\nAny other valid state issue that the federal id ah student ID A passport a military id travel that day ah we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we ...

justice NYU deal whole obese seal you and from Tuscaloosa\nAlabama where a gratified to have the secretary of state for the state of Alabama\nJohn Merrill's I Want to quickly take a couple of calls with some uh a different perspectives eh we got a call from Baltimore, Maryland at go ahead\nBy by for taking my call I just wanted to say that you know I I vote at first but I was Eighteen years old I'm sixty years old I've never missed a vote even when I was up at three in the military I was out of town travelling I think it's a question of taking the extra effort to make sure that my right to vote counted\nThank you so much for the call and I can verify that accent is truly from Baltimore or we've also got a call from Alex or from Charleston South Carolina go right ahead\nAlexander although I've been writing things drowning yeah I didn't learn anything happening I'm all up and that previous caller's comment on my marriage and active duty service member and I find that\nIt has become very difficult for a service members to register especially last minute on some of the younger service members are frustrated because they don't have\nI'm no longer have their own state id they move to different stations and receive driver's license and other states and in their home they do not accept military I eat when registering ... thirty days to receive a ballot and mail it in ...\nAnd in their home states do not accept military I eat when registering\n... thirty days to receive a ballot and mail it in ... we are getting their children are scary members by not allowing you to be used for a very good that you're straight she's been all fifty eight for creating such a huge gap in allowing him now\nAlex thank you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate at one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that it really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and there were maybe scores of of of of allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred a but the but that concern will talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless it's as we've all attest to there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote in these things\nWhen ... when he wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he's ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well so\nI wanted to build up with the last caller talked about the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote\nAnd um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem on Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone\nAnd there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and it really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill about um whether he's interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\n[noise] windy if I can make it but I Will anyway\nSome of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWell now Wendy I think you know\nWithout me tell you that but I Will say it any way\nThat we have led the nation in the last three years nine months and twenty three days\nIn voter registration per capita nobody has been more than we've done nobody's been better than we did we don't just went in football when it to ... I think it's something that everybody needs to know\nI also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration which is what you're talking about there's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people now one of the questions\nThat I raise whenever somebody introduces that concept to me\nIs it do you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but we should be an opt out provision\nAnd an opt out provision would mean that if somebody says now I Do want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whether it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I mean it will tell them is that what we have the day you just have a ban which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very very excited about this\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's ever been in a system where\nYou have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and the ... very very different levels\nOf participation in the abstract you might think that those things are very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of opt in system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates\nSky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that is to create an opt out supposed\nTo we're getting callers who suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call them ... windy day of ... certain Marilyn Monroe you specifically what would you go potentially at creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday where you going to propose it perhaps\nUm what would you think of potentially\nCreating a holiday whether it be a state holiday or even to propose that perhaps the national level to um have an official day off for voting ... it'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's been my observation in my experience people vote when it's important to [noise] and if you\nSay well if we had voting on Saturday or if we had vote on a day that was best fat as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well when we broken every record the history of the state in the last three major elections we've had the empirical data\nAs Dan said speaks for itself which is that people come when they won't vote\nWe took her to ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously ... can turn out to you sir I'm Sorry ... state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest to win one more and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race right outside their lights and people really turned out but what would make you think that people are ... wouldn't turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes him to I think\nThey were because this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go to the polls Seventy two percent of the people that were registered voted", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "12"}
