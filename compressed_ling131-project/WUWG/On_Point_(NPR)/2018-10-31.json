Georgia and you can join us where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk what is your question for America's most preeminent a costume designer who is telling\nThe visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric that she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nRuthie Carter let me ask you can look can just jump back in time deep back in time here because I read a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into the to costume design it is that right\nYes um when I was a younger a say in junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was the free counseling service for the city and\nPeople could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her and to um you know downtown or down go to ... drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide\nYou know high in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause in which kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you know junior high George you know how are you today and you know\nThat kind of a view of\nYou know people is what I still used today to\nKind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\n'cause it suddenly occurs to me I don't know what\nRacing culture and embracing people and places and [noise] you know just taking it all in\nYeah you know suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly perjury should if I Know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are\nWhen you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film that essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as the viewer\nYes I feel that costume design a can be defined as storytelling design and you when people want to associate costume design with fashion\nAnd you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear right\nSo so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well let me just let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done one Fifteen ... collaborations with him\n[laughter] yes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him\nHe actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends and\nI I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all\nYou know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know Mali around him I had this idea of getting film experience and he suggested\nThat I call us see or UCLA to their film department is\nThis idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call USC or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project case said that would give me experience with being on a fat and what that medium\nUm crew would be like yeah and\nSo I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was\nOn a U.S see students ...\nAre doing the costumes\nAre well and then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right\nThing so I Want to play a clip on that day I was actually the first one and then do the right to do the right thing okay I Want to be less likely that they're like get your field longer iffy right wing [laughter] they just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movies to this day so I just want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is this the new uh where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out and he asked sell the owner of the local pizzeria played by Danny ...\nUh why there are only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\nAt Wal Mart rollers on Wall Street Journal which would you want\nYour brothers are novels and nieces and nephews your stepfather stepmother whoever they want to live\nIn a tight as long as\nHere I might be fine now what do you watch the anti American I Am ... years last week for more we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee's Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee ... and the thing about this film outreach if I may say is that it really\nOne of its many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are wearing like a high top the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how did that play out in your design [noise]\nWell it was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a a clothing uh during that\nAnd of um color blocking and really saturated color on Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing uh during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment and so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can take cloth shortage that we made and\nIt was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really had\nThat stuff will go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and so because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and\nGDP Atlanta support for ... comes from our monthly sixteen years and out of the blue and historic

in Black Panther she's also done the costume design for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what slump got to do with it and so much as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of Reverend Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and peel striped tie and a styling black overcoat [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe from the two dozen fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who is playing Dr King [noise] well there are\nSeveral images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that have been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design\nAnd there's several books pictorial books that had been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was a real busts man and\nHe asked if you look at him and his suits you notice that you know there was a little flushed she area around the color of his neck where he button to shirt and it would kind of rule over the top\nAnd David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is he gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his assure callers for at least smaller than would what would be required so that I could also see that little ... that happened I'm at the color of king shirt I Love\nThat detail [laughter] I don't think I Would have ever noticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character\nYeah and the costume has to support the antimatter that has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time but it David every day the shirt colors were too tight um he never complained and I would say he never complained\nUm maybe it just felt right right for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk call us with your questions for ... the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\n[noise] I'm not an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this one I saw Black Panther in the theater I was just\nBlown away not only by the film but also by its potential for teaching opportunity future who's been working on a project on how we can use\nTextiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate\nAnd to teach science technology engineering and math topics [noise] and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here of opportunities we can't we don't just and you know right now we just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn three D. print things they could\nTalk about textiles with special technology and I'm like the black Panthers stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into the fabric how would you do it they're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nSarah thank you for your call Ruth you have a response yes um what I Love about series\nLab is that it's a a\nIt's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children could can do and she certainly does represent that you know she I\nWas the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black Panthers to to end and I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning\nA ruse if I may I Want to talk for a minute or two or hear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film\nI'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here\nIn Nineteen Ninety seven and you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym on a ... who who stands up uh during the mutiny trial he's put on trial for his labor is old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nIs it kind of disrupt the proceedings without\n\nCrying\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven film um is it that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a sink is wearing a western clothes right\nYes ah the abolitionist I and the reading we read that the abolitionist cave clothing to the Africans and there was an account that said in the courtroom they look like I'm sitting in the gallery and\nSo I use those words to create um clothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the case and I also wanted to present him\nA royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free and you'll notice that um the African sitting there in the gallery or mostly in these white ... the period and I wanted to evoke the feeling of dubbed\nHuh and is it also us maybe I was reading this wrong because I I I thought the part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on just it was you as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a said that they didn't quite fit
