the softer side of fears we're talking this hour about Sears declaring bankruptcy and what it means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century\nCan't hold on and is going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah ... actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nBecky Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of from main street tomorrow the rise and fall of the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know and it's competition was Montgomery Ward also had a catalog and the late Nineteen century\nUm but this was a away vets um rural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out\nOn real world cars you know across the country and you can order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard warns seniors and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approached business that all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these untapped customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ah they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited to a farm in terms of what it would have had to offer to begin with but it really grew later when Julius Rosenberg got on board\nUm and he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was\nThe gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between rich and the poor and but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities and\nA growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of ...\nShouldn't and I'm also movement into cities and\nA growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so\nIt really was about I'm reaching those segments of it when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nSarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about the years as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets and opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicky how are just saying you know also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an acre store in so many mold in America [noise]\nYeah I think in some ways a story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still rural in agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that\nAdaptation so quickly I mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe a within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to uh\nThe catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and speed with which it even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies such an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with his ears or ... years perhaps

we ordered everything that we needed it\nAnd I would pour over it for hours [laughter]\nUm I think fear is has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school and housewares I'm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this\nHe was the top housewares manager in the entire country he was very innovative very successful very aggressive\nHe he was a bear about knowing the merchandise sent me on spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices and sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it\nSo that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love to see sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school that I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that\nAnd and you know and I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about\nI'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard\nBut he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy was that his wife had left him\nAnd she had um\nTaken the parts but not the grill uh-huh and and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you\nAnd I hung up on it and he\nCalled store manager and demanded that I'd be fired and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wars suit\nCame down to you know get my head on a platter and John stuck up for me uh-huh he said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a

that means for this major American retailer it's been a retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and uh what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson talking about all the things you could accomplish with tears products\nModeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big job\nWhen you try to do it all and do it right\nBy Bob Vila procedures and the home improvement professionals maybe

technician and ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah it is here you know what we're um fears and the factory service or are they in the center for applied to electronic [noise] because\nWe do other I'm like well you do um flows hold a vote or rules pressed by we do all the service\nI see the wrong\nIt was all the story you know wherever wherever appliances sold we do the orange juice or Steve\nI'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist David he's feeling confident at least for his part of Syria's business and he's he's a company is coming full circle what do you think so I think there's something\nTo the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one\nThat's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on daddy you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances within\nBecause uh they had this relationship with you by other services business so there is something to that but this idea then coming full circle I think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor's been saying for years that here's is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened\nThey keeps shrinking they keep closing story\nOr in that space and look at the labor's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of profit last okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it is it actually might be less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel is probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty percent in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar store Sears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's why yes this is definitely a story at Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and so you're getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts\nAh we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's a those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears a best buy stock in your all time highs at it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround it has taken share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off stores like T. J. max\nAnd Ross which had been on a tear in recent years and taking share away from traditional department stores like seers\nLet's go to John is calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nThank you so I've had my first grass Minnesota to back when I was a teenager in the seventies and I was a no no pun intended guy or a Sears version and then when I got involved in the communities of Detroit I found out that there's actually a catalog houses\nAll right down the street from me that were built in the forties that were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately uh fears is kind of waned on a Saturday Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been done years since I've been an ... or because\nThey just don't like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky how are you the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself uh from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely home\nYeah I think I might have lived in one of my cells are from the Nineteen twenties\nI'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely homes and um I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed\nDown I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe um but you know you you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in a U.S that he might possibly be able to identify them as a Sears home\nAs well so Vicky how are you a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how ah in two thousand Eighteen\nYes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so why is there seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores in the years among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is\nSort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um and you know Sears used to occupy a space\nThat Wal Mart to um uh uh no does a as the largest retailer in the country a Wal Mart be overtook fears and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties\nSo I think that it fears needs to be seen in through that longer um trajectory of it Sarah a signal or early comments as to what happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties\nAnd it it's it's it isn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um [noise]", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "17"}
