us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow a and again as we talked about before before the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings from regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website\nAh for example a dawn Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town my residence is surrounded by college housing Thursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students carrying racks of course in the next party\nUntil the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students for three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nVery much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this is the story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus go drinking culture now ... is it are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\n[noise] well I think what what I was hearing from members not something I'm calling you will hear students or or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say [noise] um we're in many ways though are not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago\nIf I might just say quickly or with a couple of parts of what the what the reality is on campus was based on\nEr scores scores of studies the over arching an irrefutable\nA quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on a scores and scores of studies the over arching an irrefutable findings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIs significant and sometimes quite triage and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're at their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old and those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age\nIt ... this is the heart of the of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk those levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains\nHaving said that even given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college\nIt is not now nor has it ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students the best measures of a of of\nOf high risk drinking are about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent might be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students\nConsume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched one quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consumed so the high risk drinking\nIs relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious\nProblem significantly ... yeah so if it was just one quick point of clarification hum the navy said if I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how we defining ad well uh sometimes\nToday with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what does he use most commonly and measures are measures such as using five or more drinks that have setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise]\nMore recent decades that we've had better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because that is sitting sometimes for college students my mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up to us\nStudents might mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is uh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up\nTo a high risk level such as a point away which was the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving\nWhen one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas and that's a so if we were talking about drinking a far more in a two hour period\nWithout intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think\nIs interesting about what the differences may potentially be if we are going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I've spoken to my parents or people from previous generations seems to be different I think people seemed shock that there are just handles of odd or whatever the easiest to get a hold of\nEasily available like basically right off of that year freshman year and\nI don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be similar experiences at their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[laughter] yeah um I think that there's probably a ... D fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer um depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for um tailgate before football game tended to be more beer\nGear heady whereas parties hosted a fraternity for you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric go I think that's definitely a a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with brown eyes like you're going to a tailgate or something and stuff they're going to be beer heavy but [noise]\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty to serve beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient then just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends\nOkay well we Perkins I mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend [noise]\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on the particular\nFriends okay with Perkins I mean you've been studying this for several decades DC that same trend\nAll right well I think it is true that are depending on the particular context you might see more beer being consumed goer or more hard liquor [noise]\nBut uh the fact of the matter is that we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]\nUm and uh still nationwide beers the drink of choice although uh uh in some sectors and some schools are some hard liquor may have in increase popularity but it's when we use the word trends uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard\nOf and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all\nAnd the the island beach club it's kind of always a great time to get away and this is just an incentive we're getting you to get you to your phone or to your computer right now or your smartphone\nTo join TPP automatically be entered into into this drawing that will happen tonight at seven o'clock so taken on that right now and just do this you know you've been meaning to just do it now\nTPP dot org or give us a call at eight hundred to two to four seven eight and ...\nYou'll be joining listeners like Rebecca scholar indicator Thomas wouldn't in Augusta Louis hill in Atlanta Cynthia Vail in Athens David Friedman in Atlanta guy up Nash in Rome and Michelle Michel ... thanks to all of you for supporting G.

college drinking culture today and I'm doing by Madeleine DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nJak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eighty five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to read your tweets\nAnd a tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find a shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just let me just talk to Madeline and Brianna and jak here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you is it is it a major way bringing the blackout that people\nIn ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Stevens saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress 'cause I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress has to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before [noise]\nNo I definitely don't think that it was like the major wave to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to grow with your friends have a couple of drinks like brown it was saying you go out on Thursdays there'll be after you have a class with a couple of friends in just a couple of drinks [laughter]\nThere's there's no people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight and give us some more of like\nYou're just to catch up on me but you go to a party and there's like\nThere's all called her and you started drinking and drinking and then you walk out but there was a million different ways to relieve stress and the button you know it's not a comment one I Would say\nOK so Brianna again Stephen ... says ah why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a how century city you go for a runner you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for school or work or other things that are\nLaying down on you or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and you grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and saying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor Perkins and saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time\nUm at least not now in law school in undergrad when maybe your responsibilities learn as much as they are earning now um he might go out on a ... day because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that\nBut certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nMadeline I yeah I also think we have to drive to French distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least in my life this blackout is kind of used almost colloquially like do you like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean\nBecause at least in my life has blackout as kind of used almost colloquially like do you like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so from garlic as to what the comment on mine said [noise]\nI don't like I don't know that we are all black out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language now in a way that it might not have been before All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the air Veronica [noise]\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and the drinking scene as crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street in that kind of like dry the party theme of the nation\nBut I just feel like sometimes people are a little ashamed to speak truthfully about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's a choice\nTo black out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they doing it on purpose they just get to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to block out or not or it's more that\nYou get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when like things with what we can with Josh comment on it are happening and maybe people will say like oh maybe he doesn't remember or maybe it's like just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lying basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the caves and everything like that has to be a black eye and from what you guys\nAre they speaking they ... it's like grow upgrading that it's like ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right time\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy and we turn to you on the uh I mean you heard the question what do you say\nFrom Idaho who say for the blackouts especially I think\nWe're missing important too to some people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about too sometimes they do grow up to drink and like kind of forget about their problems I think that's also like another reason people are washing up there because they have issues are you doing jobs they know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um ... because they are trying to cover up those is ... ... what's your response to that question [noise]\nShe's in the the mass and saying I'll call because they are trying to cover up those issues ... ... what what's your response to that question [noise]\nWell I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to have put our point of view first of all of that is only as a a a segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and or talk with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise] and uh we have millions of who are stories about them it can be funny it could be that it can be scary ... and so forth but we talk about it is what most of the talk is about\nAnd understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances [noise]\nBut when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at a bad students but you can think of thousands of words for being drunk that's reflects the talked and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions\nThat this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted is not a big deal but in fact\nThe blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of of a sexual assault uh our\nOur our ... serious problems over there but they it's it's lodged in us a segment of the population but so many people don't speak out about it or against it because they think", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "04"}
