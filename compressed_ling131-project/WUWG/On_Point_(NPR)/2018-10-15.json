Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nTo seek and support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation\nWith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny and our world\nTo a different people from two different parties here with us ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nThe Oslo peace process is underway uh so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well as just stored Mary optimism\nThere now fast forward to twenty eight teams [noise] um the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace\nThe twenty eight teams [noise] um the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War\nOr there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted is farther away than ever Iran had added a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before fight signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a a late nuclear power\nAnd oh India Pakistan in North Korea has tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat\nIn lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that was the twelve consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal right to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nAnd without a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy ... worldwide is it that it can be the that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places ah Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in Hungary backsliding in Poland a suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transformed the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed\nA you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three you would not have gotten ISIS um the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better [noise]\nAnd by the way for all of this is going on\nThen countries like Russia and China in Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nAbout one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop\nWe're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nOr one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop in Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable one in terms of his ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U.S project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty said America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy\nBut you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking\nAbout well it's a broad a group a set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially what I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy to Defense Department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this\nOf this whole whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that right to comment on foreign issues on it pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and off and go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about [noise]\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the ... the Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and do there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nThese various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um UC that in the fact that people can circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and I'm playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals but\nAs I Want to get to him in ... in a second about how you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but Iraq is a disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\nBecause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but I wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security the United states I mean that's part of what you say you that the foreign policy elite as\nThings considered CPB band [laughter]\nSupport for ... comes from our monthly sustain years\nAnd the Atlanta

foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor Walt lots of comments coming here let me just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the ...\nUm so I'm sort of sympathetic to both combat it's I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful they're heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states is favored to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had a particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations at all if you go back to the Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran\nYeah Cheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning\nBoth of them and then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right yeah I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states\nAnd Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right now I'm a then finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that his ... that has driven certainly the ah intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in Benghazi and the desire to end at now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something\nBigger than that so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know that no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks and organizations who are not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money\n[noise] alright well lots of ... at least get a couple of them in here me just calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nHi thanks so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think under under current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well I worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia\nAnd uh the\nUh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nThank you for your call Stephen Wall [laughter] well in some respects I think ah our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and more to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well whether a national security for others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which the\nFor more than to promote in the world and there were other imperative says well whether a national security for others [noise] uh and we have always sort of wrestled with a which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's a national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nMost of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of ah the Saudi journalist ... ... and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been lawfully it seems to me on this one uh that his initial statements were uh were quite forgiving he seems to be in typical Trump Ian fashion kicking up a sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] so I think you know the the concern the caller is exactly right here and that's why I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interests from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because you open your book saying that then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so let's just remind folks what what the president then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nThe logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen Walt we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then about the Paris climate accord about or his a disc discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security\nTwenty six teens saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton\nTalking about expanding the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to containment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region a so here's the national security advisor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran\nA at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners\nYou harm our citizens [noise]\nIf you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be hell to pay\nSo John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is the is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaigned Trump food's not sophisticated thinker on these things but he did in to it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lotta people nodded their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is all a since Trump became president although his style his approach to the presidency and his\nPublic style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "15"}
