us from Washington today a Sheila there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns and it's it's a story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about\nUm how you in two thousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson and I believe was a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America\nRight yeah well that was um [noise]\nThat was quite a quite a meeting I it was false and they called it\nI was their members there to guide and I was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there and um the purpose of the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate\nThere was a state where there were so you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the veins of dollars into new capital into these banks are the FDA she was going to start within limits and for the we're going to start a guarantee a the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt\nAnd then the fed had trillions of dollars of learning disabilities that they\nThey put it into place and so it was ... it was basically to explain those news programs [noise]\nAnd uh they had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of that was it was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them at all but most of them probably could've bumble true\nBut we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you're just singled out certain banks for\nAssistance you are going to make them look bad you know exacerbate the problem is right so uh yeah that was the reason I\nI got to just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say again this is a meeting of Monday October thirteenth ... doesn't it you say nine men stood milling around in the room men I should know right nine men\nAre really truly some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then\nThey headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there's uneven balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it that\nUh you know who works for ... does does it ever worked for the banks are you know or or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net that get FDR said a closet insurance and fed access and all of that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government support like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize the risk taking and too big to fail\nJust really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power and it was and it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want to look like I was awake legs so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't\nBe little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just\nI I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at the ... the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me nine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of us financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected\nTo feel that we had well\nIt is and whether we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements and and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're gonna have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's absolutely the wrong system that is a system we still have that we don't want to say that system that you would live banks go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed to you know put a bag into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets\nFDIC working with the treasury and the fed to you know put a bag into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out and pose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the law should be more the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the break you know and and you're bringing new investors new management\nTo and and in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process there is some unique\nThings about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to use that as a tool we didn't have and to them we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this new process not bailouts would accountability\nYou can ask you know of celery so many questions you live there because I I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as of some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... no no I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean is the line I don't think the banks are too big already won a boy you know [noise] well uh there are\nPeople who have that view and I can understand that view and ah yeah I I don't think there's a political will a Martian to do that I mean and this is bipartisan and unfortunately you see legislation going through now that we're used to treat the largest banks we have a reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought well you know Republicans are market oriented\nWater Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]\nThat's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThat finally happens but yeah I mean if they need another bailout again I I think our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nThat again she liver I said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just it can't look look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis and and even you know the eight million a homeless lost nine million jobs lost\nAnd you know people who discount the role of the two thousand they crisis\nAnd an event you know the eight million homes lost nine million jobs lost\nYou know the the terrible hit to the public per se is still people struggling and lower middle income families um that\nStarted with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... in ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out so yeah that that's going to be the new paradigm\nThat we don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to prepared with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that well you\nKnow so okay so that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet ... of the speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period for any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis though so how does that square with our democracy yeah well\nTo CDs worth up the best of wait wait don't tell me over the first Twenty years you won't want to miss that there's

they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote\nAs long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in a in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five find this eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner of Virginia is Kyle rent for he's a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me All right so let me start with\nYou I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded\nFor the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis\nThat us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country\nA ball in kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdrawal is uh the withdrawal\nThat is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdrawal is uh the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that we used\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria\nA following ... comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and I'm its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that\nThe way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to cook it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nLiz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more over language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region [noise]\nWell\nI think people have seen a surprised by that suddenly coming out against you learn that we've seen yet because as you and then a few months ago um ... said for chips for going to be going home ... very soon and actually an expectation that they would be ... owned by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate all involved in Syria that she's Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they tried to catch up on the on us troops on the idea that that actually going to be staying I mean definitely definitely puts them back like\nWhen it comes to negotiate an end to the mall and I think it should be on the Web that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from\nDick Cheney and chip is Sherry and more and I think it should be I don't care whether that will lead to my knowledge\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric on ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens [noise]\nIf you continue to lie cheat and deceived yes there will indeed be hell to pay\nWell the very next day on Wednesday of last week week some lawmakers did question or the U.S military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs\nAnd here you're going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission and fighting ISIS\nThe problem is that national security adviser John Bolton stated that the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces\nThat to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran especially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on\nActions of Iran not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS\nKind of room for let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he'd they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're in the region with the mission to balance against U.S forces or restrict those forces for him to maneuver through eastern Syria\nMeans that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they I don't think any real administration has shown a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the U.S been brought up during the past airstrikes that have occurred\nTwo and a willingness to get a new authorization for use of military force ah I mean that's a question of the off been brought up during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from to I've been wanting to having to\nLiz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said we'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to stability to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis that it wasn't a missiles like can you can you tell us a little bit more about that\nWell yet I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nI spoke to cough that he was a shock to like Jim age and with sweet that grade our home team to ... sites that\nHezbollah is closer to the store and while manufacturing filed to be which could be used to think more and file such gate the he's fine ministry invited ambassadors took all the countries that
