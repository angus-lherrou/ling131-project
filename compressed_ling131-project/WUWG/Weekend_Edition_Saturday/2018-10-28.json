about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHi Lulu [noise] uh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened and what else do we know\nI'm twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened and what else do we know about how the attack\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] this into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern rate\nI mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning [laughter] great um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still\nI'm for cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue of to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub of section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise]\nUm and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think a point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be a ...\nAnd uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYou mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place it's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen\nSo hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help Stanley's a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nAs tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now [noise]\nIncredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life\nNonetheless the president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a\nRemarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process [laughter]\nI'm the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorse noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in ...\nThe penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that that sentence this button unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal um relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nIt needs situation than it and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so [noise]\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for crimes that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce it\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nI'm In this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the

be that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that\nIt makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe'd been living than momentum

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue of they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention\nTheir race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\n[noise] yeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise] well I think\nOr then half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago but why voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "28"}
