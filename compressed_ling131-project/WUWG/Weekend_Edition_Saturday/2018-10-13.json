from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here tell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ...\nNot far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report [noise]\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you adhere to the joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until\nRecently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ... and a church or face [noise]\nI think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is

not\nFortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who would have been harmed\n[noise] it certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it uh I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse thing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in\nPreserving their own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care\n[noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months\nUm since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my

contributing editor of Oxford American at a professor of English and creative writing at the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you [noise]\nWhen someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother's ... incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a writer Lee practice that I still have now\nBut that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps an all out of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we face up to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television is on a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chain she started to uh what me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to give her massively worse and I think the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town and her partner also started to reverse it we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of it we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was joining us\nNow is the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother debating ... that she endured all of that takes a toll on our body ... what ...\nFor example the NGO endured from your mother the ... the tree endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things I just I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural\nI thing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police I was about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and broke from not asleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every cent than on me from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that it's harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you know you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nI'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's time to uh\nShame when we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I Would want it to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about their physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\n[noise] I I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer and Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I'm trying to do with this book\nCare say lame in his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having me\nAh\nAt

Appalachian coal of Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups you're showing over tens of thousands of voter applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nThe group show in Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nWhat are the region or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases to basically works like this right you have [noise]\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker

something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote by you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about a\nMattress conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that borders the complaint that show rights groups are making\nAll the groups point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following the state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race estimate\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um\nShe says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating the base is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show
