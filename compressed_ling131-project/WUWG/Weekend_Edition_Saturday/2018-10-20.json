how the kingdom mishandling crushed is\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal could show gee is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels

abdication of global leadership veteran bathroom thanks so much for being with us go out to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nThe U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nFall at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies that first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits into French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have\nIf we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid\nJust being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America's created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries um to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and\nOne would hope that a president the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors and how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral\nValue of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be tick\nYeah I think there are a it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps them talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not\nHurt our economy and make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen from top two weeks is unacceptable even ... thank you thank thank you\nSo during the for profit is a new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War but American mercenaries working for foreign powers\nAs something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about during the rest of the nation in such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces\nForces which is what you're talking about your investigation in such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented\nYou right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right but military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\n[noise] let your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen a proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty Fifteen [noise]\nI mean these special forces or an emcee all veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill as a leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in Yemen to his llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group unless the UAE e as we writes a hired this company to kill this local political leader does he only\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support [noise] now you you should gift in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assume that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do governor whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers\nTo them that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French uh why I mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not more than ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is going to slow\nThis is a buzzfeed story not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it [noise]

the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of the smiling face of metal ... in there\nWith her toddler son eight and it was ... perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for ...\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... high school party [noise]\nA drug took hold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost\nAddiction singer was sixteen years old when production ... high school or\nA drug called

now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you [noise]\nWhat can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was ... she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much [noise]\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWhat happened [laughter] we've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine [noise]\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then it's often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nTo draw more than one program are gathered here she tried many [noise] what made you\nPure all of this in your obituary\nKnow it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to extend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now\nUm we carry the help for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know [noise]\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine\nThere's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer but to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack\nBack Matty didn't resemble that photo when she was in the throes of her youth\nAnd so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\n[noise]

bowling in General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress just see what the US should do in response not\nWhat I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution\nCancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nGot just briefly the president uses those numbers off and the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact check as is the

series since Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know the the course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season [noise] in Boston\nIn Boston that's right and if we wait exactly yes and a Christian taller debuted as assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also show playing in the NBA for their mistakes Becky habit of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio

another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive league the NBA's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast and so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point\nBut in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter] no and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's

a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe a Howard thank you you're in San Francisco to commemorate and fiftieth
