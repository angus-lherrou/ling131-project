more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling in continues we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul\nA brought his

affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure on the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested that came to mind that any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many than issuing statements supporting a boat to Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion a main fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\nAnd you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist out without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nHave been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think leverage as possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they traded very smart uh they uh looked like a hero in the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others so there clearly not a beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of a basically\nDefending a you know uh there's one man jumped on and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important part and important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why expose a ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated got\nA they need they need hard

it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so I don't want to go to the Iowa was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with which we liquidity\nAnd and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nIn many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to coach sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact senator he looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was best not more money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City poor demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were very sleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't done this is published and exhaustive look into the events of that and I had a book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they Mexican Government said that they are to me ... me he didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and received official start eat what I had seen all these years four years\nOf the investigation is dad all these ... you sound like it's not to its ally so tell us what you uh\n[noise] oh ... ... is that all the official ... is our ally is not true its ally so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and for the police not just were not these about ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and police were chasing this to dance scenes they laughed at school I mean the worse before that [noise] so the federal police and the army were chasing the students\nHow the students killed

and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students on the U.S has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this these wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling by bus is\nThat it did was just too\nUm if the students were traveling by bus is\nThat a good why just to\nKnow so these two versus\nWhat exactly did to Boston is that the army and the police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so what I was able to have found\nIs that in these two buses wore a inside a nest secret parts of the of the bus secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know this to be the ... or the army and if the police\nThey knew it so these students were almost victims

I'm like a lot of dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfits we heard it on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look about happy about that a lot of ... and as a real of a lot of young people on the small city they're especially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum they were too young\nAnd they were the ones saying that being they think that being saddled with a mess basically which is severely affecting bath each so a lot of them are really pushing for these people buy on any kind of ... jail the British Government um agreed\nWell is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um it is a vote possible\nLegally if possible we could have ... ah the prime minister Theresa May have said that's not going to be another ... thoughts that could be one technically however it would take months and months to find a second to get all the legislation in place and he said at the beginning what uh\nThat could be one technically however it would take months and months to find a second ... to ... in place and he got to be getting what Britney you to leave in March they probably weren't going to be some kind of people that I Would have to spend the day and not you would have to be put back\nSet of British Government would have to agree to that\nAnd all of the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries\nWould have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much [noise]\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump ... turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nTo they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two state to a really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are they're Rio and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottles [noise]\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nI think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years\nTry to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's get Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities\nAnd it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state\nThat sitting as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high [noise]\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the

like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm to the Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival Beto O'Rourke has long used\nLosing self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN put your name is Raphael\nHe sells hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nYour name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage manage to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized she said we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overused identity that we can bring identities in when they don't do much good\nAnd also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many political context um [noise]\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best he went on the grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or call up and\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down a terrible road because once you've created a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid\nThey're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which has political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to that they should run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm hearing a real narrative concern um that identity and the politics around it has been weaponized and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing and losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nNow the question is whether you could do that with our boat you cold rightly recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is polite said bind me thinking identity thank you very much\nThank you very much America's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in

though and this is one capital T that the people and let me ask you something mind at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yes recall it\nDecoding kitchens because there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you cook too aren't so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays
