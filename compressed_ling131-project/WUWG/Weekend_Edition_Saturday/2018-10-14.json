Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica ... so Ken Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they haven't\nReally good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gone in really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of\nPickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss ups but then it didn't seem real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by vice over education and teacher funding and you know even\nReally unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by vice over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally\nHe only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs as playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip it said in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican and parents Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in the jails for the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats from member station WNYC report\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned it into a political firestorm for\nThe issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week\nOne of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nGuns you'd night because you do have power and it may not be alive and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get down here and I think how we can do what we really are it's\nIn one state over one detention better but if we can get back down here and I think county we can we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten sours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nThe all democratic board a free holders as the county legislators in New Jersey or known a short residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this so\nIt's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice\nIn Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants and then it led to the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without pushback\nElected [noise]\nEven balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents immigrants at the jail pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to enabling that have actually win their cases remain permanently in the United states or have released on bond\nBurr says the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers unlike in other parts of the country immigrants jailed in Hudson County or a eligible for free legal representation\nThe free holders did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care bad food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week\n\n... twenty five year old from Cuba said he was raped twice by other detainees by the gel director who was also at the meeting said he would investigate\nIs all said that's not enough he urged

Navarro utility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida\nThis is weekend\nEDITION from NPR News ... Navarro\nUtility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common than\n\nLucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews that they sell the down halls\nAnd wires and we saw or their electricity fake county emergency services chief mark Bowe\nAnd says that will be a long slog this\nElectrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott errands and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to be do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases after\nBig storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about one in ten said they'd accepted twenty percent increase\nBut fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're actually be much more after we take our line right now and ... and an overhead wire\nSays in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids\nIt was in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more out is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be their standards joint chain of ensuring that claimed restructuring general population and even if the broader\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark ... covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\n[noise] like driving me so first off you grew up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or a month just over a year ago he's seen a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nThing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of all evil in the Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there are just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd and all of the associated\nDestructive miss that kind of turns once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean white clean of any sign of many signs of human habitation and construction trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nLet's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic mayor of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman who also has a lot of support in pockets of Florida\nThey capital Tallahassee Democrat and ... is running for governor against Ron dissented the former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida you know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns [noise]\nWe can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been to a benefit to Governor Scott the hurricane Irma which struck in twenty seven team here\nAfter Scott led to the stage he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nScott was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ... both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is the executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nSaid it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a ...\n... wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right\nIn the uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Sanchez for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed on your trees and he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best friend Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again to understand that like the entire pan handle is ...\nI mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls

doing she was very very meticulous in terms of the practice plan I asked her and she's very confident\nStevens is also the head coach at Dartmouth College he invited brown since the intern with the big green during the pre season and after seeing how well she quit with everyone he made a special announcement that the scene captured on video\nAnd very very impressive so impressed with that like
