this Internet research agency would be interested in whether football players took her near not during the plane of the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets it but it's not just people that are weighing in on this is a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether\nThat was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain [noise]\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency [laughter] well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\nTo it it it wasn't direct TV in a certain result just to to stir things up apparently [noise]\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord and this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue and also\nSo discord and this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate [noise]\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed correct yeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the clubs and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us\nThanks so much for having

others to have fun with the news\nOh yes but we know that we have a particular role handling all that stuff\nThat's your job [laughter] we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel

up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise]\nYou've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States or who to president says he has a rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be sense [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared to host president say ... and ... one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case that for example and we can show the audience that he's actually very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions

is pumpkin spice in the world series [noise]\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see you know the political these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely\nSpaces [laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negatives\nBut a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nHave you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV [laughter] that are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ...\n[laughter] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns\nFor younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or for that matter the season and haunt you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and good questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot\nDo you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization and the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal\nTo an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic and those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\n[noise]\nFan it's time for sports [noise]\nThe art or fiction is dead by the time our group began to get up for work there the longest game in the world series history we're still going on a teenage seven hours ... minutes is longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine\nWorld Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to ... months the in the bottom of the genes Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your weight yeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game\nUnbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of it I I watched\nUm [noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pitchers used including by by the way Clayton Kurdish arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] while the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich until after the game red socks\nAnd even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight\n[laughter] while the Dodgers have named starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex ... still haven't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and uh the Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a dealer builders\nIf I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was to nine and games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because of the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker bealer goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal\nWhen with Walker bealer being the star and then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ... that's a good question to ask a either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nThose teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so\nThe one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman thanks so much You're welcome the deal Bob\nCousy and bill Russell was
