but with a lot of vapor away that can be kind of tricky to tell what the track name is uh that's why we asked a Georgia author graft and tattered to chat with us about this stuff out of the name of the book that he's written on the subject is a babbling court a vapor wave and the modification of ghosts\nAnd craft and oh was that stuff to drop out of the studios of WG a recently to a clue us and [noise]\nGraft\nAnd thanks for joining us on the show when did you first start listening to it but when I first started listening to it and and hearing about it probably I'm\nRight as I was about to get out of college twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty Thirteen maybe I'm an by this time a lot of what would eventually be my favorite vapor wave releases would have already would have been out by then I was I was gonna be coming up the tail fell in 'em and I was [noise]\nIn to it on a just a purely musical level like the way it sounded shirt\nAnd if you had to describe it to someone who's never heard of ... before ... how would you characterize the\nDroopy syrup be war slowed down a supermarket music\nAll amusing\nRight and and what one of the many things that's interesting about bay

often it's it's one producer\nOperating under a few\nDifferent aliases\nAnd kind of flooding wound\nUp quote market so to speak you know the kind of a throwaway aspect to it you know it's supposed to

something to with like ... like the um the allure of of of of no author of like letting the tax just stand for self\nSure and and another interesting aspect to this is that a lot of vapor wave visit searches based a cassette culture which when these very limited runs of of of these records disappear that they tend to drive up the prices astronomically right for collectors and\nNot only that but but a floppy disks wow anything that limited and that kind of a femoral I mean it it would\nMake sense then because the music itself as opposed to be a sort of you know reframing I kind of had the margins music was sort of a\nKnow taking a fleeting experience maybe of moving through a consumer space and listening to a certain kind of music almost the consciously impact you know\nBob boiling that down breaking it up and looping and sampling it um it it it makes perfect sense then that the physical\nA result of that is going to disappear an excellent way to drive demand you know but it's also I think what what is going on here as a sort of Snapchat like embrace of just a media that disappears and content that disappears\nAnd tell us a little bit about the the ... that you picked out for us the midnight lover by new dreams limited I Love the way it opens with a real low a slowdown\nVoice of the CBC and I and and a lot of like there's almost channel surfing to the radio it's very
