tough\nFor Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship because there's one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korea and\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human

out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I\nThink about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore I'm looking at you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen 'em ... increases in sanctions against\nThe Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or ... after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about the enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together [noise]\nThis a government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did that surprise you in some way\n[noise] um it it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um\nBut he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends in the United\nStates in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a
