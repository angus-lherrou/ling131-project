reporter April Dembosky has story [noise]\nWhen Janet Winston goes to the doctor\nShe feels up on gas impacts the sandwich to big services\nWhat I Need to make the three hundred\nWinston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nNeeds to see a specialist she often drives the hours one way to Stanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away she got that rash last winter after horseback riding and it lasted four months\nIt was itchy and wait to read the like poison oak\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to bomb neo spore and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends pain call a phony um\nTested her for a hundred in Nineteen Seventy\nDid coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends or pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred in Nineteen Seventy usually found in beauty products Basset\nTrace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on one since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it when it's been left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge but medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that a four cylinder ... engine does it have the top of the one who to stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of that\nWhen students insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars a company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the masters doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars to negotiate it that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nI Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw Monica ...\nThey don't have insurance like hers when I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King was\nLovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to\nPut a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nEight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor references Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes

take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade enough that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say though that most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing\nBull snout of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an\nOff duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects still\nHad to remind him and the people the people ... about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they say he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in\nThe rainy he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any race and then I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license\nHe also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they ... they were ready [laughter] people hit David I'm sick of robberies and the sky high ...\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a than a quarter a senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder or a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of that people are

San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel care pose\nLovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [laughter] ah yeah it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it\nThis is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means they're few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well\nSimple don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks
