produced a radio documentary called seek a love stories among the people he met there where her Montana so ... she's the head of a support group for parents called the United mothers of angels\nThey are still emotional about this whole known low singing town multiple ... to get him out of ... gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers [noise]\nYeah that's right I mean it was a cart remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on education to many of them very young as well\nThis is quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they are very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity Barry to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us so it was a ... a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels [noise] uh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's just that one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you know she's one of

started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children on may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those set up about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus [noise]\nA few of them are things that chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well uh I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there is some children who've ... words can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over on the fed through achieve into

then she had had twin\nHim who he was acting just thought you would expect to turn off for a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um\nSo they didn't really understand they don't know why it affected one twin ... another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that some people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families that are really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to know and how would they be able to access
