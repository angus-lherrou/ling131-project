years and thought she had just four to go\nBut recently she called the ed department and someone told her oh I'm Sorry but you don't qualify not until you consolidate your loans but she was told if she does that count down to forgiveness would reset back to ten years\nI can kind of let my guard down and said this kind of sucks and she said yeah it really sucks [laughter]\nTwenty nine thousand applications for public service loan forgiveness have been process so far and other those Ninety nine percent have been denied in other words Sarah ... story is not unusual oh well see that's actually
