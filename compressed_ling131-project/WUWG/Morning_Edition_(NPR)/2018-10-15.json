think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades and estimated eighty thousand Americans died and thirty nine year old St Louis Mandel is almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurrently hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's held in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out it was\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong nine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you send a message to the other day they were having\nUp and running out time done that much\nThe medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nBenefits are having\nUp and running out and not\n... but by and large sums of improves when she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu had to lead to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCurly was putting to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair\nAll of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard to Dr Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity\nFor Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but L. to family members that came to visit got to do for you know I got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still nine at him\nI was lying awake at night I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for

the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world for resources to the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show\nSo I'm sure she'll filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is the more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon ... about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry\nOr more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon Shabaab hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr is it getting the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales had been out pacing your domestic sales\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact that you said\nThe larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\nStore to the sewer but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap Danny you agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just to profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the options on the table so twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting some scotch do remain bourbon drinkers or you take your profits back which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this then\nWe don't like any of them said in the obvious cause the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a law that has um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\n[noise] well I think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war fan and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage to you know to be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue to issue like at election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us and in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring out at the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky he\nWill note for the non geographically minded right across\nThe river yes ah in in ...\nIt was president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon me six decades he will not for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he tells you understood exactly that this decision mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and call bourbon thanks scientists of federal law raised a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States I'm like holy David sandwich announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that with urban you've got to make it here in American if you want to sell you better maintain Kentucky\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been say I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequence is one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years sadly if they start looking and from my standpoint is\nUrban is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose them for generations\nBarrett Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total that damage damage from hurricane Michael which hits Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phones and

buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas for the last generation timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster without insurance in Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nGOP debate last week and she sent me a hundred miles per hour winds just closer to what the last April source of income\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb\nAnd caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but ... says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses and yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and everything\nBut obviously that's not going to happen or you know you're you're talking to people that I Would have destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures there's ... there's going to get an image box of your of your patients better as to what your child first birthday\nWhile some

NPR News\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirmed judges take another whacking Obamacare help President Trump shutdown them other investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to a Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLook it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across for\nThat will greatly affect the will and goes for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former topic\nThat it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margin they won't be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goal I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump Ian base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nOh even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News support\nFor CPB

nine he's director of government affairs at St Louis realtors association in like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out it was\nLike fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong nine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with his nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you send a message to the other day you are having grown up and running out time during that time\nSlow but by and large sums of improves when she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong\nAnd right now I'm not\n... but by and large sums of improves when she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in here do you knew he had the flu actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nBarely was put in to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we're told they may need to say goodbye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to share all\nThis from the flu it's hard to say why hit

doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nDoesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely

drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world for resources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nHe sits on a lump sum show\nThough I'm show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is the more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nTo make the world but it's whiskey how global business is the more\nAnd more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon dj about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it's getting the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact that you said\nThe larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nBut yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just to profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the option is on the table with twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers on or you take your profits back which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any of them said hey we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans ... a lot of that um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with

haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue you made an issue like at election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us and in the past few months he set up a meeting

you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks scientists of federal law raised a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which now so you could move some production overseas we can't do that but you got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better make\nGetting a next year we're going to have a problem with exports if this has been say yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we already to last for years suddenly if they started looking and from my standpoint is\nUrban is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose some now than we might lose him for generations Barrett Gregory of Kentucky distillers
