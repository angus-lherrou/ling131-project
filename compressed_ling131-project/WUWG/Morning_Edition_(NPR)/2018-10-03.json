exploring the origins of the u._s. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\nShift\nRadio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea that started the war invading the U.S back so the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\n\nDouglas MacArthur is landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war and read the turning point the fighting started out and start building mobile the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next why stop\nThere why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula\nThe spread ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMake Arthur's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them there are a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert account a flash they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug for what\nWas the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one [noise]\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division his name as general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure and none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots\nYou know this is Hector calf or add up to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nIn the Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for a never been in combat instead\nHis

they're going to have to leave his sister there forever and so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city\nAnd they found her

this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to be with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship [noise]\nHampton Sides

was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check years and is not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nBut listen carefully to how it's being described president\nCatch that do this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do does the local police\nWere following it a little bit to some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas\nThese were following it a little bit ah some more than others that Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... in Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the nature of how public that investigation is because [noise] anybody with any social mayor who's watched it on TV has turned his sons any potential witness for victim has a let's say ten\nIf covert did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nBy trauma and formed interviewing and saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying and doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we should investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators while it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this semester ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar attacks by the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News\nB.

contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and in our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the set of went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work high Cokie icy here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee failed to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does that affect their legacy for not\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations presidents are sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean that is not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right only\nAbout a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused removed Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he did\nAnd they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington ... when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move just to save for deceptive chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed to judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found but he lived in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\n[noise] it would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was knocked convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house representatives said he'd wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew um but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth to Connecticut and I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm
