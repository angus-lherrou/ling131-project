prime video\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad who was on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think the more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those recruits commit money or resources to their mission I think that [noise]\nAnd particularly its find or keep the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did he start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight [noise]\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start disorganization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson\nTell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who was fundamental in starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is I'm a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he ... he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his high school of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and [noise]\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nThey ... the founder of the organization now what he was going [noise]\nWell that's something that we asked the [noise]\nAid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\n[noise] something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in that piece one detail if they switch also helped empowered Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview by that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nSays that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nOn my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested she stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also at the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nThat are potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court to those who actually are willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia [noise]\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to the view that says you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization did just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to\nSexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\nWe'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\n[noise] well the story it's really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the\nBuilding up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf [noise]\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community or the sense of\nA lot of people at a feeling there's something going wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has no just a a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well it more technical stuff like well how do we are both a process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin in the story was published Katie mile or has temporarily step down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News\nThat condition is known is acute lasted ... or a a ... for short it can start with symptoms such as ... I Lived the difficulties following the CDC has confirmed sixty two cases and the last few months mostly in young children since\nThe CDC began tracking the disease four years ago a total of three hundred and eighty six cases have been confirmed\nOne case was a seven year old boy and his mother Susan coin says her son came down with an ear infection this was back in the fall of two thousand fourteen\nSo I sent you to the pediatrician and she put him on a antibiotic\nBut within a few days Evan complained of severe pain in his back and legs he became extremely low star jak and went downhill quickly\nHe total control and both his arms and legs you know one minute you have the healthy head and the next minute your kid is totally paralyzed it it it was beyond horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunate\nIt it it was beyond horrifying to us\nIt's not clear what caused Evan sickness and the CDC's Nancy ... says unfortunately the cause of this condition is still unknown\nI'm frustrated that despite all of our effort we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing and got them for the reasons why they may be at higher risk\n... says given the rise in cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery and they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as ... virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response the arm or lake weakness paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it mentioned you pointed out that this does not polio\nRight now we know that oil virus is not the cause of these cases CDC has tested every still with us and then from the earth and patients none of the settlements have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases a FM is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms the Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases in adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child develops sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd those are the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on recommended immunizations and using insect repellent to prevent mosquito bite\nThe case of Susan coin son Evan he's healthy again he was treated with steroids and he was an occupational and physical therapy for Eighteen months\nIs fully recovered he has regained all movement and all strength in all foreign land\nBut this is not always the case some kids who've been diagnosed with a FM continue to have

Falcons it's the first in the entire state and girls like Ashley Jeter of Duluth Hi are psyched about it\nIs like a big opportunity for and I think it's like oh my God if I can say this you know\nAnother woman's site to hear about the league is Jen Welter malter was the first woman to coach in the NFL and she also play professionally for both women and men football teams when I spoke with Jen from her home in rural Beach Florida I asked her what it was like for her to coach men in the NFL\nOn one of the best experiences of my life you know those guys were they were excited they were proud to be a part of history they really took to it and I told people all the time we shouldn't be surprised for these guys are great coaching from a woman goes to the coast of their lives are all\nRight from their mothers that friday you know every time one of my player would introduce me to\nTheir mom or their grandma or they're on you or that strong woman was so profound and they're like I Need a special connection we had because those were the most significant people and the geysers for a lot of guys and so it was the last four and a lot of people might have thought\nNow you know Gen men and women we do tend to communicate differently though so when you were coaching them how to navigate that communication\nOnly about five foot two hundred thirty out so relative to those guys you know I'm kind of ... men my mentality on that was you know I may not be able to yell loud enough to make them scare me but any one of them could\nAnd my mentality on that was you know I may not be\nAble to yell loud enough to make them\nHere me but any one of them could lean down through expert so there was so much knowing that some time you know being a little softer a little quieter um\nWould allow them to lean in and that doesn't mean that I didn't make my points but what I didn't want\nAnd you know this as well as I said it would be the optics are being the first female coach in the NFL and say for example I yelled at him and he yelled at back at me that's very normal and football but\nWhat I didn't want that to somebody say oh well he doesn't respect when the weather I was right or wrong out there and if that could have been great so I was very conscious of putting my presentation in a way that was always seen as like trying to clean the very best out of them as opposed to break them down\n... do you think that the NFL is coming around to this idea of women being more involved in in the NFL not just in playing budding coaching and referring I Know that there was one full time female official currently\nYes so Sarah Thomas I'm there's actually a really good friend of mine and one of the best game I like to say that\nEvery glass sideline has to be broken and she was the first one to go to as an official I was as a coach and what that does is it lose things on several different levels number one it proves that it can work right because until it does there was always the fear factor and it's also a first mover syndrome you know like a lot of people\nAre scared to be innovators so I'm always painful to say that you know Bruce area and two was the man who hired me ... it was released on what we should look at as a champion for women because\nHe does change because somebody has to be first somebody had to be willing to stay you know what I Know

released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin

how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nWho is Katie my other why did you start this organization\nThe mother's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship for the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight [noise]\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kitty ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that she brought to this was an incredible depths of love to love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an evening Macintosh Johnston\nTell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also being part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was doing this to not equate that can be using these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment the girls thought he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his high school for power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and [noise]\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me\nGirls

the founder of the organization now while he was doing [noise]\nSomething that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail if they switch also helped in power Johnson was the fact that ... had an intimate relationship with them but she conceded in an interview by that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nSays that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get to\nMy lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story and not after Macintosh Johnson was arrested she stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died on as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with him which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls are potentially at risk no important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court to those who actually were willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia [noise]\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the Chinese leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you

given the rising cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery and they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as ... virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response the arm or like weakness paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it meant than you

Jeter of dilutes high are psyched about it\nIs like a big opportunity for anything it's like oh my God if I can see this you know\nAnother woman ... hear about the league is Jen Welter Walter was the first woman to coach in the NFL and she also play professionally for both women and men football teams when I spoke with Jen from her home in rural Beach Florida I asked her what it was like for her to coach men in the NFL\nAnd one of the experiences of my life you know those guys were they were excited they were proud to be a part of history they really took to it and I told people all the time we shouldn't be surprised for these guys are great coaching for a woman most of the coach of their life cycle rides on their mothers\nThat friday you know every time one of my player would introduce me to their mom or their grandma or there on your that strong woman was broke out in their life I Need ... special connection we at because those were the most significant people and the geysers for a lot of my garden and so it would last more than a lot of people might have thought\nNow you know Gen men and women we do tend to communicate differently though so when you were coaching them how do you navigate that communication\nOnly about five foot two hundred and thirty pounds so relative for those guys you know I'm kind of aren't met in my mentality\nBad communication I'm only about five foot two hundred and thirty pounds so relative to those guys you know I'm kind of current and my mentality on that was you know I may not be\nAble to yell loud enough to make them\nHere me by any one of them could lean down to whisper so there was so much knowing that some time you know being a little softer a little quieter um would allow them to lean in and that doesn't mean that I didn't make my points but what I didn't want\nAnd you know this as well as I said it would be the optics of being the first female coach in the NFL and say for example I yelled at him and he yelled at back at me\nThat's very normal and football but what I didn't want that but as somebody say oh well he doesn't respect when the weather I was right or wrong that was aired if that could have been great so I was very conscious of putting\nMy presentation in a way that was always seen as like trying to clean the very best out of them as opposed to break them down\n... do you think that the NFL is coming around to this idea of women being more involved in in the NFL not just in playing budding coaching and referring I Know that there was one full time female official currently\nYes so Sarah Thomas I'm there's actually a really good friend of mine and one of the best game I like to say that\nEvery glass sideline now has to be broken and she was the first one to go to as an official I was as a coach and what that does is it lose things on several different levels number one it proves that it can work right because until it does there's always the fear factor and it's also a first mover syndrome you know like a lot of people\nAre scared to be innovators so I'm always thankful to say that you know Bruce area and two was the man who hired me and our ability is released on what we should look at
