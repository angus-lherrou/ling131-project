governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw the district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nDepart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the stark

they're going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the ...\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nWhat you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want the dry you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve where\nDemocrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right\n[noise] well I Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nIt's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level I'm using Republican

in two thousand Eighteen well\nCertainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win [noise]\nUprising local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement
