new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIs simply another choice for consumers for many ah is more affordable than the other products of them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the AC exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill\nDr ... it's more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bell after that deductible as Matt people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nAnd the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes

Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that tank\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government have their own flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nIt should go we don't govern the Palestinian ... we don't administer ... or not loose governed by the Palestinians but you can extend a governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and\nPockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism\nThis is the best way we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\nYou believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank\nWell first of all we up security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that good or don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off but here's how it's done\nWe have say intelligence about terrorists so in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to know why should we\nYou know and often we have to do it because because we're willing to to take the risk within attack because we weren't at the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but they also or you know attack\nUs internationally final prime minister because I Know your time is very brings hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you\nIs there also a risk and being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has has\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support of Israel is had a bipartisan support in and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nI think that uh you know you've seen that we could have agreements and disagreements with some ministers was for example we had a\nYou know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and and I appreciate that\nUh so we can have disagreements and yet have a basic agreement about the importance of
