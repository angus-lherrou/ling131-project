for the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents is he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nThe droid gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nI'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just\nUh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the ... at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nI don't I don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time [noise] so\nIf your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight teams will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting Lynn so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who are willing to Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the ...\nIn a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what your wrist off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nKnew when they go low we go low\nWe go what did you mean what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nHas you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going after them at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to\nAsk for more I think gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people\nShould or should express themselves attorney general holder thanks so much and I think you [noise]\n\nAll right Steve mega millions lottery is up to one

lot of problems with office ... she has sometimes not everybody knows who's in the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nMight've been above where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then if somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nPaul you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're off his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those so I Would never say not to and I understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that\nThe last

as long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nOr trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nThe droid gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won\nInclude a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat one that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\n[laughter] no I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nI don't I don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty teens who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight teams will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter

will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get ruling that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ... or a a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what your wrist off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nKnew when they go low we go low\nWe what did you mean what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nBut I certainly think through votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration was very powerful when young people marched here in Washington to ask for more is saying\nThat gun safety

Atlanta I'm Leah Fleming this morning the American association of university women is releasing a new report on the state of the gender pay gap the group says that women miss out on roughly five hundred billion dollars each year and are paid only eighty cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts\nTo help combat the issue the group is launching a new digital course it's called worked smart on line it's a one hour program that focuses on teaching women how to skillfully negotiate for pay raises which the group that is a crucial part of narrowing the wage gap joining me now to talk about all of this is CEO of\nA new W Kim churches good morning Kim\nGood morning to you so why are women making less on average than men\nLook I think we've seen that the pay gap has been stagnant for far too long and women while we have um continuously increased in the labor force where almost half of the labor force right now\nThey're still remain remains some of those uh blatantly biased sees an implicit biases that hold women back from earning what their male colleagues make in the same position I\nI Am tired of talking about eighty cents on the dollar Leah we've all heard this message for far too long and so we're taking much more of a pragmatic practical approach of saying how do we get this done at a federal level\nAs well as mean as a poll and state level I don't know about you but my first job all I did was simply say thank you I didn't even know I could negotiate when my first offer was made so being able to train women right I'm being able to train women\nI did was simply say thank you I didn't even know I could negotiate when my first offer was made you know being able to train with men right I'm being able to train women uh how do they understand their marketplace how do they understand how their skills and abilities match up\nIn their geography and in their sector and then preparing them for how to negotiate um we believe is one part of a multi pronged tool to help close the gap in our lifetime\nSo you've got this worked smart on line a tool I tell me a little bit more about the school and how does that work\nWe've been doing all these in person workshops and continue to do that but as the numbers yet again showing that women are simply not moving the the wage gap has only close to buy a nickel by five cents in the past two decades\nWe need to do something a little bit more aggressive so we developed an online tool that we're launching today that helps women in their own time whether it's at ten PM or seven am on a Saturday\nLog on and completely for free learn the same skills that we're doing and the ... percent workshop so they can be as prepared as possible whether they're looking for a salary increase or exploring a new opportunity and the workforce\nOkay I'm going into your report the pay gap is even wider for women of color so black women or sixty one cents on the dollar Hispanic women fifty three cents compared to white men is there something in there for women of color to learn\nHow we we think about this it's it's even worse than that if you can imagine\nA black women also take on much more student loan debt than their male counterparts do and so they are compounded with student loan debt than are earning I'm far less than their male counterparts you can never dig your way out of that and so the skills that we're teaching both in the work smart each tool\nCoupled with working with municipal and state leaders and federal leaders to really pass some more aggressive pay equity laws uh and paid leave laws in states like Georgia", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "23"}
