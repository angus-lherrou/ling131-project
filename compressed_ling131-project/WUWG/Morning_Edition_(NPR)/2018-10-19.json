with this patchwork system what is the deal is with jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is ... heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how the laws changed since the court granted black citizens vote and wait for the owners based barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't and their neighborhood but did an Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named\nAnd vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was aimed immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nAnd what about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of\nCourse that men were given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of whites of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment and Nineteen twenty\nBut you know before you're sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars in frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nBut we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state

and she's on the line walking to the program [noise]\nGlad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning been like\nA health plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors and philosophy\nThere was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern\nAnd worry partly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true and partly\nWidespread of

this is a measure taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down I mean kind of hard to very large province which is to fly off\nIt's the least have its intelligence tape and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously

anthem trend lives here she works in community affairs for utility company she is raising two kids\nOr parents also live in this community but she\nSays their lives and her's are so different\nMy parents are pretty much their lives are in little Saigon my dad works at a pharmacy\nAnd so their lives are in the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experience racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminated against I I think my parents have that because really they their lives are here and their communities here to go to Vietnamese mass they go to their customers are getting these are our ... our diverse [noise]\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nThese generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend have been leaning more democratic\nAnd they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend have been leaning more democratic and that is one reason the party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem tram we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high she invited us all into her parents' home her kids were playing around they were eating snacks and they were orbiting around\nThe grandfather [laughter] how\nTran is ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter decent backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me it was certainly no fan of president Brock Obama who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom are like him very much\nAnd then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far\nSofa in this country who do a good job what do you like what do you\nStill unemployed low uh-huh and the\nStock market in a brokered in Greece and\nSo the economy is important do yeah\nAnd that this is this is um I open it [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of trying to see how they talked about that is the first time you had a surprise because then I'll have a conversational that either stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam as the crackdowns on freedom of press I basically writes\nWomen don't have the same right there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a prize said basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam so we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be valid districts day\nBecause you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump called the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMany of all I like all go home and not to you\nFrom time to ... talk about\nMan you well I like all the whole ball and we got about two years from now you're\nGoing to some time to press talk about what these changes\nBut they don't care about the two things\nThrough just has to yeah CNN again from\nFall to both the same\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if you're does is the al\n... they spend a lot I think it allows apple I'm Trump\nBoxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter] [noise]\nDo you think do you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump\nIt's not fair to say that Russia interfered in to the left in this country ...\n... when they know that\nWhy I said oh I shouldn't before\nThe election [noise] the way until from\nBoth the left it and they might do so [noise]\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with and the Russians would that bother you yeah\nBut you don't you don't believe that you're just\nDoomed proven that don't need to believe them\nYou know bad groove that but I'm Ava FBI then just don't know which as dropped out at all he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some of your ground yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views as from what you hear like dinner conversations that\nYeah go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this you know\nBecause I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person I clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad\nHas a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got devoted to vote yes both tall toys\nAnd fall if you were thinking\nTo think everybody should vote yeah\nMy father I didn't mention any he oh after the war he was a political prisoner\nTo think everybody should vote yeah he\nMy
