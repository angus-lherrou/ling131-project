the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nIs number one in the house and I thought oh no no no no no no I'm going to them I don't know I'm I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school Roger ... here in mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger\nFury tears\nPolitical he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room armed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious and her retelling of what happened to her previous there's\nBeen exploring the idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there is a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has\nWomen protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of\nMen's anger [noise] being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women saying well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation they codified some of the very end\nIn ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think\nIt's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color\nWho has been the leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's [noise]\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [laughter] that's\nTrue but that could have been true of so many other weeks in the past two years\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so as women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service\nKavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is the character assassination by the left so is women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still I think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRachel\nThought there was Rebecca Traister the author of math the revolutionary power of women's anger which is available\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOn after another nobody you know in the White House in July\nWTO's treated the United states very badly and into\nBloomberg News interview in August\nWhich the WTO was single worst trade deal ever be good if they don't have a I Would withdraw from the WTO\nFor one thing the U.S government complains the judges of the global trading organization which oversees disputes overstep their bounds because Robert Lighthizer us trade representative speaking last year at the center for Strategic and

international economics at the University of Cambridge\nLike the United states the oh this is a little bit of an infringement on our right to regulate our own domestic consumer markets and so there's

paddle boarding even swimming in Lake Placid I'm putting aside the WTO are right now the mood is really different shapes\nWithout any question the case that this is a crisis\nCase Rockwell is chief spokesman for the WTO she says the organization is running out of the judges deer appeals on trade dispute in the past two years the WTO is gone from seven judges to three by the end of next year it'll be down to one and unable to hear appeals\nWhich observers say could encourage more countries to violate trade rules and that rock well says could hurt the global economy\nIf the rules of the game or not being adhered to and enforced it creates uncertainty and that affects investment decisions sourcing decisions\nAnd businesses could become more cautious about investing a new projects which could hurt jobs in gross us insist he just wants to reform the WTO but many observers are skeptical of Trump's intentions\nNow in order to to make them better which you cannot do you are like the system I'm completely ignored and that's what the Trump I restrict streets doing today\nMarcello ... is a professor of international economics at the University of Geneva because Trump would rather do one on one deals where he thinks the U.S can get better terms because of the vast size of the American economy Laurie August spoke over Skype\nIf you ask me what I think he's distracted you they called us from ... to get ... to do with you because then the u._s. can do whatever you want to cross being quite decrease ... wants to impose us rules on every country\nWhich would up and the

Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack by health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs\nAnd he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman or talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nAnd if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our healthcare benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what didn't\nWhen it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently [noise] she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital they would just say listen our prices are price\nThey took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices is there a lesson here for employers\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep
