child\nOver the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida is lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem when I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was saying hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back ... you know a lot you know as I was reading in bed you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nFor was there a rock bottom for him [noise]\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period\nAnd through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account um while you're while they're taking his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore [noise]\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived for a short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAfter I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street here was homeless yeah he was homeless for\nAlmost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe up Senate seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what the catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough\nBuddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's
