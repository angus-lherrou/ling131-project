David\nGreene and I'm Noel King markets in Asia where mostly down overnight after a bad day on Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index in Hong Kong slipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January and its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai to morning Rob\n... are thirty percent drop for China's stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWhich one is kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt Sparling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this here it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested in\nIsn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China and it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\n... years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\n... doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of time speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR E. D. Sam or net has more\nAbout a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some insane Francis\nThe member station KCUR E. D. Sam her net has more until about a year ago\nHardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers [noise] people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nAgriculture oils frustration\nSometime in coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about blocking so what is\n... ... or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology okay give\nIt like the ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger is a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is the main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems and everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nFits it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nPaul gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch we want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause there's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution to the things that the climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nMcCauley said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nThe trees to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute McCauley said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look at the ... thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something not solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nFor NPR News I'm Sam\nIt starts with a Facebook post after the twenty sixteen election\nI'd like to take and gerrymandering in Michigan if you're interested in doing\nThat says well please let me know smiley face that's Katie Fay he's the organizer of voters not

redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he says Michigan's maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise er Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of for Republicans or Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the maps\nBut the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change your system that already works windows ... is a Republican and has worked for for secretaries of state she says this whole thing is skewed to help Democrats\nA gimmick and it bypassed us our elected official in our democracy and if they want to have the pen they need to win elections\nThe initiative comes at a time when voters are frustrated with politics and government or any porn is president of ethics Emory appalling and research firm\nThat has been something that has been building for years\nHe says that frustration came to a head and twenty sixteen\nPeople were dissatisfied with the government the federal level is really looking for members of Congress should or donors in corporations and their leftover coal\nPolls looking at the redistricting proposal show it's been gaining popularity over the last few weeks but it's still a difficult subject to get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning in favor of the proposal\nShould the person in an office get to decide like gets to vote in that area when I actually have a right to choose in and it just makes me wonder well how much rights do we really have\nEven if the redistricting measure passes back not

stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei that hangs saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob ... are thirty percent drop for China's stock markets sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWhich is kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debts boiling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this ... making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in trying to stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this here it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock\nAnd going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China and it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing ... years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to be depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's\nEconomy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR E.

everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the block ... transparency is its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems and everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nFits it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nPaul gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\nNor is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment and then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nTo the things that thinks climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and he's a proven to be about\nOr people to stop driving cars to pollute McCauley said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things have you been proven to be valuable tool for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agreed but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the
