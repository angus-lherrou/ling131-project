Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nHurdles and says one big

significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nBurleson says one big reason is that companies want race\nIt is an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products Burleson says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions\nTurtles and says the carbon tax his group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurleson says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president in the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal
