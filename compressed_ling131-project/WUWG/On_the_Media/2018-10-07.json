Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if\nSee the Eighteen Ninety I start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silence didn't done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee deadly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\n[noise] it took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers\nYou know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them that's it\nI was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate you missed the point\nWhen Disney was a low point we had ... stood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done [noise]\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out describe what happened\nTo be a Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight declared it Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian that happened on his land nearby off the following three to purchase a contrast island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's\nPlan nearby off the following three to purchase a contrast island for twenty four dollars glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doing from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our flights but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country\nAnd it did definitely do that in Seventy\nTwo you were a baby when a few hundred Indians power than to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who is one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\n[laughter] yes I mean they hammered out sort of a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government they one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be for revenge from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding in trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and the takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi when of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or this is not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join that care of and [noise]\nThat sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that we have the virus in order to be\nI don't want to see him when he killed\nViolence who might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\n[noise] so what is the narratives you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds [laughter]\nI Want it wants to fraud destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world enter serpent and fourteen Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right\nDid you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by having everything stolen from us [noise] Indian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and\nI think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice\nBut plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of\nBut plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws\nPlenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grid and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better in my mind it's a story of surplus\nThat's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really seeking out to be on the show\nDavid Dreier is no chip away from the leech lake
