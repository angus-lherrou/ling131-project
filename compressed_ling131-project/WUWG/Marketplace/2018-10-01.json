DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us and we start\nToday with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nThis we will ever result of much more happening right here in the United states that means\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tony Scott\n... alright manufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um he's really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so let's take automobiles auto jobs are at the center of the rhetoric of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell\nHere in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yep we set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain and finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and this bureaucratic I'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China\nAnd more jobs in Mexico or let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year hasn't been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect out of jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\nTo fit into that\nThere's still says a large percent\nFrom Asian and is to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour so how does that fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more [noise]\nSo what companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robot more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly take 'em all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have terrorists on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's I'm a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd central sitting here in D.C today what are the chances this all gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting down a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats convert will take the house rights and historically Democrats had been more anti trade deal that this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMark ... thank you very much and welcome NAFTA has had a long history question vote yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on the little tab that says mentioned on there\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A. the White House says the agreement is a quote when for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he runs Loftis ranches and you ask them a Washington they grow apples and also hops for beer\nWashington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back they supposed to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nSo far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course still with a lot of uncertainty already\nI just didn't look I'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nUh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the in the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good\nMovement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were impose that movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWhen we look at that are you sitting here thinking this is Jess ... again or are there differences that you see I mean has just plan for you on the ground is it the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses um both tops and Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had lost fears and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nThink we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world than ... would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a weave\nWorld and I would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a we've pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us in our industries\nThank you for listening to marketplace on Georgia Public broadcasting this this listener supported CPB a family of public radio stations all across Georgia including eighty point five CPB Atlanta\nEvery listener plays a vital role in ensuring the future of public radio that is what our fault phone drive is all about your financial support makes everything you hear on CPB possible international and national news from NPR Georgia news from the previous award winning news team\nPrograms like marketplace wait wait don't tell me this American Life MORNING EDITION\nEverything you hear come from a listener supported the amount it's up to you what's most important is that you participate now in the final days of this campaign please don't put it off any longer go now to G.

asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loaded the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country and within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us hailing uh-huh\nRemind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people go on line\nThe over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers who'd have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like no blocking of whatever let's say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down\nIt's like a button and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever website you want to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which has a deal\nWherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix store data just restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a very vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now the California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or video streaming company ...\nSaying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies on the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your ... your Comcast that have been pushing California to not put not neutrality rules into place\nAnd are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why the during\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration admission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and things to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of\nHow goes California's so goes the rest of the nation\nOr all the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will fight plays out\nUh not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect until January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level or the ... companies and\nSince January at this point the Justice Department is
