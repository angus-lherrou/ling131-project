Dave Davies\n... welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal and give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years and so it was founded in two thousand for\n[noise] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access

you know this was a long process that\nUh get connected to them how did you convince him to share so much time with him [noise]\nWell he did it I should say reluctantly um you know this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this for a big\nPowerful company [noise] um [noise]\nAnd who I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president [noise]\nAnd uh as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it\nExcept the idea that [noise]\nTo an extraordinary degree mark soccer break is\nFacebook I mean that is the reality he's the cameraman he's the c._e._o. he owns\nControls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and end with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized [noise]\nHe had to be a part of this project [laughter]\nThe company has come up against a growing and really serious decline of public trust both among politicians and among the general public and [noise]\nI think they recognize that at the core of that and I think he recognizes that there is this profound question mark around what does Mark Zuckerberg believes and what does he stand for what does he care about how does he see his role in the country what does he see for the for the role of technology and\nThis project was my attempt to try to answer some of those questions for myself and for readers\nUm soccer started Facebook when he was a Harvard it takes off and it grows and grows because they are determined [noise]\nYou know to to get more users to connect to poor people as soccer Berg likes to say and you write that in about two thousand seven to plateaued at about fifty million users which a lot of other kind of similar platforms had done what did the company due to break through that sailing [noise]\nWhen they first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important which is the ...\nWondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important [noise]\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they had to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise had been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they cross the barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nSomebody did something even more important which was that it is tablets [noise]\nThe sacred importance really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as a former Facebook executive said to me it was really cool crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was ... it was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea [noise]\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when\nFacebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd in one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could get you into Facebook and use it [noise]\nThey made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own site we're actually going to try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the you know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of developers of programmers than they otherwise would and it turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to get what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nThe was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they'd done was they allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold back data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which\nOn the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold back data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door or has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company [noise]\nToday and you write that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users to you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved him a Sandy Park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way or [noise]\nGet where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nIn other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm ... including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this\nFeeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that",
