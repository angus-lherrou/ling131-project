you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep on a leash that he would hit him with his car did you say that\nThat's that's ridiculous\nWho talks like that

roll at the end of this this forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insults as that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nYou know I Know I Do not go round insulting people I Hope ever\nBut the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that I never say that\nAnd the person was sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nMcCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nComedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue a pet and living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why I was even there I moved there with my sister and then just was still kind of lingering and uh\nI had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York\nSo three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right [noise]\nI went up on stage the second night I was in New York and [noise]\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but\nI Love making clothes I loved watching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise]\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm going to go this direction\nSo um did you perform at\nGay clubs I\nDid duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhen you went into a regular comedy club you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling you have to really shut them down like truly showed him now not just like OK buddy you know God it they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God [noise] I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I have\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God [noise]\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work somewhere I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know we've kind of go down that road of like going to get a show of hands for women who isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do votes and then talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think he's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like ... to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nThey asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching sang times so\nKnow there's the light oh aerial ever present or not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the white man flashes ... yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four and ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up and people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth [noise]\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... shot like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great\nFlash of light and it happened right on a laugh then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing\nAnd I thought boy this guy really likes me either really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I that I truly didn't know\nYou run of the women who has taken on like producing and writing films and\nHas been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\nMm\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross my guest Paul day now is probably best known for his performance in there will be blood as a teenage evangelical preacher imagine being in your early twenties and working on that film with director Paul Thomas Anderson an actor Daniel Day Lewis\nThey know it was only twelve when he had a part in the Broadway revival of inherit the wind starring George C Scott they know also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy now at the age of thirty four he's directed his first film called wildlife\nThe screenplay which day no co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name wild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and he's looking to his parents for a sense of home instability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet\nMeanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to join the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone\nAnd that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives here's a scene in which joke comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires in ways [noise]\nTalk to your father tell them not to act like a full nappy Spanish\nOr new more alert I waited for much economic by middle pleas for me you don't know anything about our you'll get burned out well I've been reading about them I don't know reading about it if you work in the G ... what's going on with the father is leaving us go fight wildfires why\nWould the grocery store we'll go out with a bunch of them are getting\nOlder than me [noise] for for does it pay [noise]\nDollar an hour [noise]\nBut what does it pay [noise]\nDollar an hour [noise]\nIt'll be a long way I don't know how it's going to go on and everybody said oh what do you think about I\nDon't know what I'm doing the\n[noise]\nBut they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air because this film was adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wild life how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that\n[noise] um I was a fan of Richard Ford's I just read a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called book court which is which is now closed at looking for any other book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nEven the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWhen you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happened to have sitting on the table here\nSure [noise]\nIn the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy base an oil boom and my father and brought us there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho in the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or assume would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of it collapsed and was gone in the wind\nThe language so I I'm a big issue for a fan and before yes I yes I agree [noise] he'll tell us more about what you related to\nIn the story of this is the writing which is beautiful yeah\nBut you are adapting the story so what was it about the story that\nSo even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach one class\nAnd thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home and at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do\nThere's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and Matt\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen [noise] your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and\nSo we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan I'm\nReally close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having struggles and that relationship sort of what a profound and gets difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me\nHow family is\nOf the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggled in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn that clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is that ask game a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid's rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nJoe and I have something in common and and Richard for it and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I went up said some out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then it can I help\nWell my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated\nThey like the end of this book strangely which is out there in the film half resume living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together [noise]\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and hear teen evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century during the early ...\nAngelica preacher and small poor town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century during their early days when they're discovering that there's oil there and\nThere's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis who's a bit of a con man and also an incredible capital asked to come to town and wants to get as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist and in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church [noise]\nSo this is a scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parent that ugly that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken and a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another\nOil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWith us here for them\nCan hear you\nJulie I'm going to be All right\nDown on me [noise]\nGomez year you wrote\nGrows wild but you have also brought your bad habits as a badge is larger", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Carrollton",
