say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with ... said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory\nMcCarthy at what point did you start thinking about other acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue a pet ... living in Boulder, Colorado not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd moved there with my sister and then just was still kind of ...\nTo a pet and living in Boulder, Colorado not sure exactly what I was doing or why I was even there I moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh I had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and they said All right [noise] I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and [noise]\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT ahead and finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but\nI Love making clothes I loved watching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise]\nAnd I did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction\nSo um did you perform at\nGay clubs I did duplex was one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhen you went into a regular comedy clubs you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you had any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] I just I mean every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know you've four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling as you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God [noise]\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um [noise] it usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend an oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like can I get a show of\nThing about oh you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow has your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like can I get a show of hands for women who isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think he's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with\nAnd now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is Washington Times oh my God so\nKnow there's the light oh ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the white man flash it at like ... yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four and ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me\nHe's really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were ...\nReally likes me either really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for

Broadway revival of inherit the wind starring George the Scott\nThey know also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy

stability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose\nThe mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet meanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to joined the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone\nAnd that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives here's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires sort\nTalk to her father tell them not to act like a full nappy Spanish\nLearning more alert I waited for my chairs and all the time and place for me you don't know anything about our you'll get

[noise]\nBut they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air that this film is adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that\n[noise] um I was a fan of Richard forwards I just wrote a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called ... which is which is now closed looking for another book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nEven the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm gonna make a film but while this book is for me\nWhen you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happened to have sitting on the table here\nSure [noise]\nIn the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Moran Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy base an oil boom and my father brought us there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho and the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or assume would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of the collapsed and was gone and the wind\nLanguage it's just so I Am of the richer for ... before yes I yes I agree [noise] he'll tell us more about what you related to\nEnd the story of this is the writing which is beautiful\nBut you are getting the story so what was it about the story that\nWas so even in about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach swim class\nAnd thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen [noise] your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen [noise] your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan I'm\nReally close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound and I guess difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me\nHow family is\nOne of the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggled in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nAnd the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is a ... game a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I\nThink so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid's rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nJoe and I have something in common and and Richard Ford and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I wouldn't have said some you know out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then it can I help\n[noise] well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated\nThey like the end of this book strangely which is not the on the film ... living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we do not always lived together\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be but yeah you gave such an amazing performance and this year very teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nDuring the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nThere's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis his a bit of a con man and also a ...\nA capitalist who comes to town and wants to get as much of the oil there as possible\nAnd played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capital asked to come to town and wants to get as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist and in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis is Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church [noise]\nSo this is the scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken and a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another\nOil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWith us here who\nThe cages you\nJulie I'm going to be original right\nDown on your knees [noise]\n... year you wrote ... whales but you have", "year": "2018",
