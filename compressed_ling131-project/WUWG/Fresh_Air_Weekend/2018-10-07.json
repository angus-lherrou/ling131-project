lets Richard no it as they walk down the street after leaving the fertility clinic\nWay in hell and doing\nWhat we should think about it\nBy which are just explore the idea of you know we feel\nLike a

she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Catherine ... as a feminist and the character and and in the novel a on the cover there's a woman and there's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt was so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nSolar watched\nIn college [noise] and then his ideology ally that I could have a

... and ... and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life [noise]\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in\nYour own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah you like the ... and Katherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself [noise] yeah I think I was\nI think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of the leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know would pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to\nPursue your or to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now\nSuddenly she feels like

wrote and directed slums of Beverly Hills the savages and the new movie private life which is now in theaters and streaming Netflix\nPrivate life starts Catherine hon and Paul Giamatti as a couple in their forties trying to have a baby do any means necessary fertility drugs in vitro fertilization egg donor adoption\nTrying to have a baby has become like a fulltime job for each of them it's emotionally draining and it's draining their savings to\nIt's also become a source of friction in their relationship\nI think it's fair to say than in your movie you'd give pretty equal weight to how the husband and wife are experiencing\nTrying to conceive or to adopt and they they each have their own like emotional crises that they have to go through\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally on comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul's portrait\nOf I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with a savages too when you're writing some thing but so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie [noise] and instead of getting in a car and driving across the country ... I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like infertility land was important to me that it was a mutual [noise]\nI don't know a crisis that it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her\nYou know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter]\nI think really cheap awful porn and it looked like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right\nThat's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines\nI Can't believe that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical offices and somebody has to go pick up [noise]\nGo down the street and pick out some porn magazines and some videos\nOf ... he says like rolling his eyes instead of getting aroused his ruling died at the point I I was hoping to find something better do you like something yeah yeah it's not very good call and I'm ready to call it yeah [laughter]\nOkay um so um during the process of when trying alternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child to really feel like you're a child [noise]\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents half of you and half of your partner\n[noise] [noise] and the man [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nMm Mm Mm\n\n\n\n\n[noise] this is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross\nLast week Facebook announced the most serious security breach in the company's history in which an unknown hacker was able to log on to the accounts of at least Fifteen million Facebook users but that's just one element of the crisis facing the world's largest social media platform\nFacebook was the conduit for Russian backed disinformation campaign and the twenty sixteen election that reach tens of millions of its users\nAnd the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica got access to the personal information of eighty seven million Facebook users which they used to target messages for the Trump campaign\nFacebook is now under investigation by the FBI the securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade commission and authorities in Europe and Australia\nOur guest New Yorker staff writer Evan Austin us explore space but history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine\nHe says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach has jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled go send the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air is Dave Davies\n... welcome back to the fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal and give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years and so it was founded in two thousand for\n[laughter] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists getting connected to them how did you convince him to sure so much time with you\nA lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with you well he\nDid it I should say reluctantly um this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this for a big\nPowerful company [noise] um [noise]\nAnd who I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president [noise]\nAnd uh as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it except the idea that\nTo an extraordinary degree mark soccer breed is\nFacebook I mean that is the reality he used that term and he's the c._e._o. he owns\nControls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and end with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized [noise]\nHe had to be a part of this project [laughter]\nThe company has come up against a growing and really serious decline of public trust both among politicians and among the general public and [noise]\nI think they recognize that at the core of that and I think he recognizes that there is this profound question mark around what does Mark Zuckerberg believes and what does he stand for what does he care about how does he see his role in the country what does he see for the\nFor the role of technology and this project was my attempt to try to answer some of those questions for myself and for readers\nUm started Facebook when he was at Harvard it takes off and it grows and grows because they are determined\nYou know to to get more users to connect to poor people as ... likes to say and you write that in about two thousand seven to plateaued at about fifty million users which a lot of other kind of similar platforms had done what did the company due to break through that sailing [noise]\nWhen they first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now\nWell the first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important [noise]\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they had to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise had been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they cross the barrier they smoked which\nHad prevented other social media sites from growing but it did something even more important which was that it has stabbed list [noise]\nThe sacred importance really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as of this former Facebook executive said to me it was really cool crowd this was the\nTeam everyone wanted to be on was ... it was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea [noise] ended up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when\nFacebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd in one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could get you into Facebook and use it [noise]\nThey made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own site we're actually going to try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the you know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of developers of programmers than they otherwise would end this turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to and what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nThe was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they'd done was they allowed an academic research or to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold ...\nSo as a platform because what they'd done was they allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company [noise]\nToday and you're right that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know [noise] ... developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did he find [noise]\nWhat he found unnerved a senator kill us had joined Facebook at twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're [noise]\nWe're people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nIn other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm think rooting for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "07"}
