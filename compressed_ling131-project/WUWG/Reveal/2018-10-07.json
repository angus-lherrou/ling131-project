over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that fear so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mission I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third time be convicted of any crime may be considered as armed forces and be imprisoned at a labor for life\nThey don't tell the full story what do you mean\nWell the da's office also uses this law and a different way to get people to plead guilty in cases where the law never appears on the record\nFor example they'll tell someone charged with a misdemeanor crime a petty offense plead guilty or will bump up your charge to a felony which is much more serious crime\nNew Orleans public defender Lauren Anderson sees this every day is a client\nHas for example of civil battery charge which is an estimator\nBut there was some kind of object that we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here it might go across the street and aggravated
