Chicago it's this American Life on Earth Day with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWas judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face to drag his decisions down to the wire over and over\nTo the undecided than see Mike unknown Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week there's if we can made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill [noise] she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story from Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women according to him on an elevator\nAnd tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nAnd just admit for an interview [noise] gift late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nJust released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get the elevator to get the vote now he was you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation\nAnd he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick it declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination confronted by a mob of screening protesters and the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and\nCrumbled our team was one of the two women in that confrontation play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days\nLots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two\nWeeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nWomen do this morning to remind also\nWe talked about it\nWas the thing is not the thing that convinced him as well do testers don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on\nThe other side of the building or who's in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham brings the women's jumped on the elevator with a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand for one calling out you believe women Senator Flake not easily\nFor when we were you thinking what do you have to say something is going to say the winning right now and the survivors\nWhat do you have to find something you said a winning right now and the survivors\nQuake making fun of themselves\nLike slap him and his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kaplan I'm\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a daily basis undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nYou know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would act one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just does ensure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that area and we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to\nGo out of this room today and and just have the little humility on that trust\nIf you watch the news\nYou know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here [laughter]\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't this off putting to him they thought it might be\nJust staff said they'd never seen him like this\nAgonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nAny decision on a boat\nA debate\nIn a decision on a boat\nA debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was ... was already raw you know\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat or at least a Republican defector fleet comes home\nTo the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nAn friday flake announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nYou know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report [noise] um and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court how I Am not and I don't I\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging he would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes you said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsked people [laughter] stuff [laughter]\nBreeding you but you're kind of back among among your people\nPeople stopped ... temporarily party [noise]\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is

recording that we've found of Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years to him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nYou know remember the [noise]\nThe Senate is a political party and\nThey have to act in a political way\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd the integrity\nTo do\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful about\nSouthern southern southern southern learned a lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nWas speaking to an audience could in high school students\nBut as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience cutting high school students people asking staple cases we'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way to find any he's a big talker and explained his job how it works\nUm just the nine of us\nBegin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um when we know that were required to make a decision\nThe courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four cases and it's not just\nReverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThan let's say five to four\nOr five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high five thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all says\nWe realize one of us will have to write an opinion\nCommands the allegiance\nAn opinion that explains\nThe principles of war the principles of the constitution\nThat controls the result\nWhen we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case\nUh we draw down on a capital of\nTrust we make a withdrawal on the trust that the public has been our institution [noise]\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy hearing to our judicial by hearing to the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nI think when we strike matter no it it just tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nAnd we started you know I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nI think it was a Saturday morning\nFor my schedule or there's are both it was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to Germany for a few minutes ago I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs uh how do you possibly do that I said well I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and or if they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have a separate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera cases\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious or here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand is alive the rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it wants to expect it to six back [noise]\nI think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nClub in the Palm

stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them in fact one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to some of the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode people come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nUp until the article was published\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article\nFearing his co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI thought incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone who choose life imprisonment\nWhen in fact all I had to do was declines of death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nThe death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fend could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nThe cast so they would have been no mass trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else happened something ... never expected or wanted\nAll stories mother Marilyn got in touch reached out\nWith an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness\nForgiven me\nI wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that fell so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that\nBut I I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message and how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nTo ... began reply but I didn't have the courage to finish person to\nServe you know there's so much pain in there and [noise]\nFeel like a really Red Wings up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email had execution date was at the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened planet Judith carry the parents who the victim came forward\nIt seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in\nThey released publically due to carry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent devastate based on\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they're innocent of is deet\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nBut he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want [noise]\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nNot do English would have done to begin with for not following my ... for not trying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you ... object will remain and our intelligence acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge\nAnd so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would reads that I Hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email\nAnd thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nChills or forward original emailed to spin the once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about\nWhat I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness ever even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article says she shared it with her son\nOr tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much interest so little\nBut would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place in\nYou know I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... at all or some\nSome of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter]\nFairly lives in Fort Worth Texas\nSome of the stuff I don't know some cookies yeah OK fairly lives\nIn Fort Worth Texas sort of the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I can stop offering a food but she kept saying\nWe want the coffee or tea\nMaryland is told in stately smiling eyes ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you have Marilyn ... she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up no called Marlin should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial trying to Maryland doesn't feel like the same person there because every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison and her friends have fallen away you know well why aren't the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to where she does that look upon her son and he says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable\nAnd they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our\nVows to cause the bottom of that and\nWas a very hard for me\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay\nAnd I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nTowels appeals more exhausting took up\nAll over time and energy I date which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work\nI felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job barely then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nIt's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm Stuart now\nLike they\n\nCan earn\nYears after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland red spends article she saw him someone like her
