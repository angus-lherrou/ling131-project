them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into their building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they were running their first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district him or Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not say their name on the air

members who was a power corrupts them doing this Lisa so I'm explain how this works exactly [noise]\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\nI saw that run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from ... city fire during these drills [noise] so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the\nTo put your finger on the sensor as of\nAnd it's a little tricky\nTo put your finger on the center\nAnd it's a little tricky\nAs a share of that meeting he's playing the shooter [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nRunning from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie

here we go [noise]\n\nCereal [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nThat's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing there were five\nWas the courage first it was it was the doors\n\nSo controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seem like the best option to though [noise] I\nI talked to John the principal about this you know I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school\nHe says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for help I don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was\nRemote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a sheet or gotten a building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis as a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target\nMy can't miss\nBecause they're finding is\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting her\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to get one at a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking\nI I wouldn't have believed\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do\nLike staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish\nIf she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything\nBack one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures

they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can still not enough to have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help from the BBC Chicago this American Life America last\n\nTook one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure at the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\n... before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared\nWork day I mean they knew what to do the new\nEven still even with that we\nDo the training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question whatever producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she didn't enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOne she and the other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWant you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures bases\nWe know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every day is what a code black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\n\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused\nAnd she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThere they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are reading by me under screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she still enter doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound\nIs it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction as\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nAnd it wasn't the drill to shut the door and let people and yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that ...\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise]\n... in her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [laughter] [noise] the group is small enough to fitness applied call that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there\nIn the closet and it was hot and dark except students faces live by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she tax takes on a tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor [noise]\nUm and so my ... my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nHeard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on and when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I said I'm not sure what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that in training very slowly at the hand\nYou're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nFit in power that in training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to know\nAnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em to her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey seized the teacher who's ... is she survived Scott Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open when he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway ... when\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually have been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study\nAnd they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped\nNow I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and\nNow I Move us all to a closet\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of it is\nAlways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom ...\nAnd training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has said lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the fact of and these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its\nXavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done but she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at the glass\nLike paper over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran all the codes their colors and meanings the concerns I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I if I could read your tapes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat bad means active shooter means I have to do that versus if I said there is a gunman in the full keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea\nThat this is all you do do you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight\nBasically trust your ability to make a decision\nTold her about actually occurs how she'd stood in the doorway grabbing of dozens of students from ever that break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with this and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door\nBasically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked and barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull the kids in her room from the hallway\nBarricade herself or\nFewer kids would emitted in oh\nI'm barricade herself first\nFewer kids limited in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for something concrete to tell my daughter's school\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I I don't know exactly and\nSay it's not great\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practice\nTown investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all they have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all but my daughter to know everything\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're ... ...\nIt's okay honey you're doing it now\nOkay his name is Tom present ski graduated last year there cross to set up for three people he knew well\nOne of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved kids and she always try to be strict with them can never keep on that front for very long\nJust breeze taken nice\nNice to eat rats\nBreathe with me\nAfter a few minutes he's cut his breath enough to talk\nTell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop\nSaying he wants to take action somehow\nAfter a few minutes he's cut his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop\nAnd he wants to take action somehow\nYou hadn't had suddenly switches gears start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and I was going on in this world\nThat can go get a share of the jurors doors are so able to do and now he plans\nTo get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year so we're ... says are actually gun owners to and they have a twelve gauge shotgun we believe in a Second Amendment to say they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories bump stocks persuaded by saying not ever than he says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nA friend but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control about maybe cues of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nPlenty got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broken up\nI reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment\nThat conspiracy theorists there's truth ... or ...\nTroll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting it can get dangerous for after that Philips is on gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats that had to get the FBI involved the demand was threatening him ended up in jail hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nUm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting\nReliving their worst moment over and over again\nCancer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were\nReliving their worst moment over and over again\nCancer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us\nThis was back in two thousand twelve and her daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado\nAbout a half hour after the movie started to find called Sandy from the theater the minute\nI picked up the phone there was [noise] screening just [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background\nPanic and she said I'm there's been a shooting\nLike what is he talking about because Jesse had been [noise]\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThe coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster\nAnd I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nAllies and Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\n... found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting Sandy Hook or twenty first graders and six educators died days later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yes\nBecause we wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nThat when they arrive at a community center in Newtown and he says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nI said that's what we look like five months ago\nWas that looked like [noise]\nAnd then we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nThey said that's what we looked like five months ago\nWhich was that looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other ah they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there [noise]\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing [noise]\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality\nLooking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the filters that there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWhatever they're they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson parents love kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis was the moment that launched the filters into what's become their life work they could see the need\nTheir new expert than what to do when your child died and the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other bunny and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nWith a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids voted to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state\nAnd however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nWhat they want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light moment ... should be should shame as you were [noise] certain\nYou know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person who will be the shooters were obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear\nWhich makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWhat's that support looks like over time and what it means to the parents who get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple of from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at\nOr something was neck he was the captain of Brooklyn swim team\nLost their son in the shooting in Parkland Monica in that store at\nOr something with Nick was the captain of Brooklyn swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nWhich said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less watch Scarface together\nToday the shooting mentioned on the phone calls\nIn tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay when her since I heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set a police officer was giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who ... description by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick\nThey went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in his knee calling from somebody else's phone I'm the media was calling you give any comments can we have to find your son and I was just like\nAnd um at two o'clock in the morning we see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we couldn't even find yourself you know and I hope all that he was arrested and object keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to her house\nAnd then they told us the news\nThat he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare [noise]\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on
