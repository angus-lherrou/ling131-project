P.\nB. remember in the news was boring and politics is boring but\nIt happened right wing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same of an income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me oh\nThis one feels the worst oh oh oh I think oh I'm going to the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so long like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so a motion\nOnly raw world that have been watching it was emotional it was the setting and and then since that hearing we've had this week and I was waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state education and disbelief\nRepublican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nWould even in moments like this one [noise] there are people who haven't picked aside [noise]\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody\nIn that situation in our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake center\nSecond act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nLife or death no real experience or understanding of how to do it\nAll those people having to make these huge decisions\nAre not comfortable at all\nStill real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decision\nThey are not comfortable with all the b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life on Earth Day with us [noise]\n\nOne judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned on the TV and you'd see is tortured face to drag his decisions down to the wire over and over\nTo the undecided than seemed like a new one cabin up there was a yes that was like wait a week to see if we can made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a guest again a British is do we change has been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and\nThen he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always the first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story\nFrom Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nTo tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed its mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN staring at sleek peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview [noise]\nJust like these can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like a little tuned in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get the vote now he was you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words I have no reverberated around this country\nFlicking declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protesters and the youth wing of the Democratic party\nJeff Flake incredible ... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\nI'm ... good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential there were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days\nLots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two\nWeeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff Flake the mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nWomen in the morning they had to have your mind also\nWe talked about it\nIt was a saying there's not the thing that convinced him as well do testers don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building she was in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham rings but women jumped on the elevator with a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand borrowing calling out you believe women Senator Flake not easily their\nWomen we thank you what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now and the survivors\nLake making fun of themselves\nLike slap him and his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge cabinet I'm\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nYou know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got at I Would just urge colleagues to recognize that area we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today and and just have a little humility on that front\nIf you watch the news\nYou know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nTonight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night freak stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found cabin are credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him that they thought it might be\nHis staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nAny decision on a boat\nA debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was because they were all [noise]\nIt happen just like he predicted\nSeventies of being treated as a Democrat or at least Republican defector fleet comes home\nTo the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday flake announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging he would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes you said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before\nHe feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people [laughter] stuff buried jump what are you\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in a kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\n\nChase ... of a program that turn out of this recording that we found that Justice Anthony\nAnd they were\nVery case sort of gives you a program that turn out of this or a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being question into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today jak potential colleague starting the confirmation process has changed since he went through all that\nYou know remember the [noise]\nThe Senate is a political body and\nThey have to act in the political way\nPrimary new there\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd the integrity\nTo do\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThink the church should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get a for an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSouthern southern southern southern slanted a lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asked embed escape it cases we'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works\nUm just the nine of us\nBegin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nAnd if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved\nMost senior judge or to the\nAnd if the case it's a one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um when we know that were required to make a decision\nOf the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case and it's not just\nReverse from it's a question that the rationale\nThan let's say five to four\nTo five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up\nThere's there's a moment of all\nWe realized one of us will have to write an opinion\nCommands the allegiance\nOpinion that explains\nPrinciples of law or the principles of the constitution\nThe control of the results\nWhen we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case\nWe draw down on a capital of\nTrust we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy hearing to our judicial by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nMy story I don't know if there's anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nI think it was a Saturday morning\nFor my schedule or there's are both it was it nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf and tennis and they were gracious enough to Germany for a few minutes we'll do you have any questions\nAnd ah what attorney raises ...\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs uh how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and [noise]\nThat is leading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have operate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera cases\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually\nPretentious thirty are here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nUh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand is alive the rule like that when I write those race I said oh it wants to expect it to six pack\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nClub the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up a total and complete amateur\nHas to decide the death sentence\nPrevious experience in
