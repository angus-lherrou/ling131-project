dose of serial which just launched its third season and I could see all kinds of great things about their third season and why should done with it but I Will not right now instead of just trying to show I Would [noise]\nThis is Hannah Hannah this is Sarah from this American Life Hi how are you I'm good thank you how are you good before we go any further\nFrom WB easy Chicago it's this American Life I'm ... sitting in for Ira Glass and you're about to hear this story the same way I did blind all I Know is that it's going to have a coincidence that\nI have no idea what you're about to tell me so I don't know yeah and land on me\nThe story is I was a freshman in high school I'm Out in high school in Montana\nYes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip [laughter] so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman this qualifies as a demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle chairing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common\nThey decide to pair up room together and ride the bus together the orchestra friends\nSo um we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know 'cause we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I live\nThere is that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing the little games all around there and we won the super troopers to know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute and you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand and\nOh what did you go [laughter]\nA plastic parachute and you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand\nOur what did you really\nI didn't quite believe him about this she went to that is true too bitter person I just\nDid a Google image search okay but troopers and I'm seeing images of the little guy is the way it is it a generic name or is it the brand name I think it's the brand name I think from what I'm seeing here imperial super troopers\n[laughter] sinus or general coup a trooper yes [laughter] exactly [laughter] [noise]\nBack to the blonde hair Hannah and her new friend Lindsey go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try their prices\nSo we we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and through the through the troopers over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really bad and we were just like in heels of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice in our friendship\nReally had to become best friends all through high school senior year four years later another orchestra trap it's time to Reno nevada Hannon Lindsey or in their hotel room studying\nAnd so when ... sitting at the desk in the hotel room in Reno nevada and poop a trooper comes flying out of the sky and land on the window sill [laughter]\nWe're and we both like we couldn't we couldn't believe it when you open the window and we grab the pooper trooper and we\nRan into the hall to try to like find other people that are just are like we saw what had been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that happened\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories they don't really fit in to our usual every week we bring you a theme format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them\nI mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was a doubt or French [laughter] you know it was just it felt you know I I'm not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like just sort of cosmic and larger about us\nRod or something like the cosmic larger that'll\nOnly hit us that we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own thing so we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did hundreds and hundreds of you did\nWe read at least Thirteen hundred coincidence stories interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned\nThrough most prone to coincidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidence is also happen to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list for many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike\nAlso there are coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address weird stories about a lost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach but decomposing hiding the man who got his favorite T shirt\nBack from a stranger's naps ac Slovakia\nThe woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson's at the same time\nAbout the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway and the one person who just happens to stop who comes to a rescue it's her dad lives for hours away and one of my favorites from a woman named Joe Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City\nBut they pull into the second avenue stop there is a garbage can perfectly positioned to help her out\nSo the trainers and and the lining up for this can't and as I get out of the core of my I cannot eat like another person heading my direction kind of like going for the cancer\nAnd uh you know it's all coming up and and and as I'm throwing up and that can just aren't going to start the start throwing up and they can to and we're both like animals teenage sleep barking into this can\nHave a patient and read and I look at each other like wow\nI don't know how to how are you feeling like I'm feeling a little bit better now might need to do\nWas the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice girl your age do it with you\nAnd numbers so many coincidences with numbers\nOne woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with our extended family and I suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names twenty three letters\nMichael are nerve antibody\nTheir extended family and I suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their name [noise] twenty three letters\nMichael are nerve antibody\nMary Elizabeth ... William Arthur event the body\nCameras to guide them all doing surveys people their phone number it's obvious the guy who surveying starts to make up a number he says nine three three\nSix\nWhen he read out that last number I used to date and I try to get back for a second but I was cool and I said no sir I'm Sorry but not your phone number showed why is it that my phone number because that's my phone number\nOn the phone number that you just made up actually my phone number\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I wanted a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old it is\nBut it goes like this ... ... that's my friend un un de\n... and what isn't any if there is no coincidence ... stories\nNo coincidence no story to imply that\nOf course life's ... [noise]\nI dunno developed in ways that we can predict so is it like if you heard his story with a coincidence afterwards you might be like no coincidence no story like that right yes just the expression you use it to call it like a corny thing to say\nMostly I think I Know it will be if you ever use it\nWhen I'm forty yet [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say at today's show no coincidence no story all the big man's away we're going to sneak these coincidence stories on there all the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty three teams\nAnd they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid for me until the actual interview wouldn't spoil a surprise [noise] which is also why there is so much unprofessional giggling this\nIn Nineteen sixty [laughter] and he had proposed\nTo her [noise] I'm going to slow this down and ... just to let it sink in Palin's mother had almost married Stevens father and his late father actually he died when Steven was Seventeen [laughter] how does all came out was that after they had dinner they went back to Stevens apartment and they were looking at Steven's family photograph\nSo you know my future mother in law's flipping through the album and she sees my dad and so she asks a you know oh what was his name and my mom tells the name and you know my my future mother in law just not the kind of mood or keep the flipping through the book doesn't even say anything to\nImagine what she must have been feeling was seeing that photo suddenly dislikes lighted yeah crazy has\nA she is must I think should be really good at poker [laughter]\nSo ... says nothing goes home later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been she explained that the reason they hadn't married with because her father highlands grandfather\nHad chosen a different has been for a man who became hound father [noise]\nAll of them ended up living in the U. S. they quickly lost touch Steven didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later\nThat's what the hell and you know caused as a as if they tell you and [noise] she tells me and I was I was floored by it um and you know together will be called my mom and you know she put on a good face on it she but she was she was pretty shocked\nDid she know that there had been this other woman that your father had in love as the\nThing my dad told her years and years ago you know there was this other woman that I that I that I Would love with at one point but you know long before I met you but mom was like look you look past ... past who cares um\nOf course you know never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that one that I mean she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have not supported Elena me a ... you know it would just been like look me with the daughter of this ... of the other woman\nYour dad loved I mean it would be ... you find\nTell him to me um you know it was just been like look me with the daughter of this out of the other woman your dad loved I mean it would [noise] can you find someone else [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nI hate this ... and ... did it come to mean anything to you or to ... [noise]\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I Wish I had yeah\nAnd then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life I get to think that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd it might actually help his father is a a strong believer that idea that somehow my dad is somehow it's behind all this and that somehow you know he's got to help make all this happened\nAnd [noise]\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named after they've been out maybe eight times\nAnd I thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was ... and I was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking about asking her on a friday day today and I'm set up and I went out to lunch or stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit\nAnd uh I got some change went to the deli order my sandwich was six box or something like that I pulled out a five from my wallet and I pulled out a couple of blocks change that I'd gotten from the store handed the clerk one of the ones are and then I looked at it and I I pulled it back\nWritten on the dollar and pencil was I asked her and I thought oh that's weird you know I'm thinking about asking her go study and I get those dollars has asked around bizarre so stuck in my pocket you know ... I went to the store I got one of those floating frames and a little piece of gold one may and I stopped a dollar and the\nFrame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold whereas if you know you're going to go in a church in Italy and they had a a fragment from the\nRobot some saying or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n\n\nSo I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all getting there\n\nI'm so I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all guilty of that I I had one more thing for you and I gave her this plane with US dollar in it\nI I start unwrapping it and he's like it's a dollar with your ... and he's he's all like beside himself and I just looked at him like\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit more concerned and uh I said you know is there a some sort of problem I I was speechless\nFor the first time ever\nBut I said you know remind me to tell you something later ...\n...\n... okay you know we I let it go and uh we you know we're really should've got engaged got married a couple of years later\nWe were um unpacking at a new apartment that we had an and I had the life on the the frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm never told me about this hour what's the deal with that you said well\nWhen I was Nineteen [noise]\nYou know I was a cashier working in a a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know\nThe right person that they're meant to be with\nDo how do they know who that is I think you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets US dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just write them your name I one actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve\nAnd so just dollar bill that you gave\nI Believe is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married but the that you gave me the dollar bill\nAnd it was pretty crazy and then he read we found this story again he asked me like five or six times\nAnd it's just the details on changes the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside himself that actually happened and that I didn't tell\nYou know I I don't know how I found the will to not say anything Tom but I just remember like do I don't I Do I don't do it you know what do I do\nI didn't want freak this guy out and be like why does cause already talking about marriage wait why forget it\nSo I didn't want to treat this guy out and be like why does already talking about Mary just wait why forget it [noise]\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything so I just got to move forward and then after she told me I think I went through all the the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean for us are we going to invent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace or like well what's the\nSort of bigger\nThing that we're not seeing here\nNow just sits in that very same frame up on her\nDresser and I look at it every day that I wake up\nSometimes I reminder that we have it [noise]\nWhen she's upset at me or angry\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know what I'm going to kick this kind of the curve\nBut I but I Do believe it's because of his dollar that I feel that tied to them I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind I'd be like ... oh\nI Know this is my soul mate I Can't just walk out on him\nYou know we don't we don't even wear wedding bands I'm like why he's just I Know I'm stuck with you [noise]\nYou've got the dollar bill [laughter]\nI guess you can also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like look I'm catching then [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you can do that [noise]\nPaul and Esther ...\nMarried for Nineteen years\nAgo\nThree weather can you spare a dime\nThat story comes to Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nAnd when I was in college um I'd actually touching a fraternity and Iran and the like the seniors\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so while I'm tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears a team\nIn the in the van and they take off\nMy Japanese friends do precisely what you don't want them to do is we're an after school special this is the point where you're yelling at the TV saying don't do it stay inside but they decide they have to find out what the strange men in the band have deposited at the top of the health so they ran up there\nWe get to the top and we kind of look around and then we see that kind of on one side of it there's just this manhole cover like a circular man will cover like you'd see anywhere\nComing from one of the edges of manhole cover it in places is\nUm long brown hair human hair long\nBrown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out\nThey have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nPolice car happened to Dr died they flag it down an officer tells them to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd been said\nYeah there's a girl and the thing\nOn the west side of town for the last couple of days so my\nParents are down like hurts just sort of drop\nAnd you hadn't known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea [laughter]\nSo we we just kind of got scared at that point\nCan I have ... is it started getting at funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have I don't know you don't tell me [noise]\nUm so\nShe called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple cars\nAnd they both get out and tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nOverweight and they go walking up to par [noise] and it's dark so we\nAnd they're both get out and tell us to get up and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nOverweight and they go walking up and it's dark so we can't really\nEven though well but we can feed them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying to look but of course I'm working\nWhole of the human figure out of the whole [noise]\nOh my God and then she says\nIt's a man of ...\n\nI don't know what my friends with him but I was sitting there thinking own like\nHow does this story ended up okay in a\nYou say the main\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells a story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says those us we did it\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover\nThe mannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone said to him and he said I think\nThe real coincidence is that it's like our close friends that\nCaused this to happen until they were good friends here\nRight right\nNo Jeff turned out that is not the real coincidence of the story [noise] everybody's or Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point\nIs just pointed out that I miss you and I are both missing current events in my own story I submitted it to incidents of during\nThe main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nI have five words for you Dr Chao potential\nCoincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection it's that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on\nBecause one event line up just so you can't help but you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to very big questions about fate about God even to people who don't believe in either one\nAway coincidences are kind of like short cuts to very big questions about fate about God even people who don't believe in either one\nNotion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan conjured through coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in and I've heard or seen a thing that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered Daniels\nBut on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the living room and ask my dad\nReally Daniels was and he explained it in the forties the bill Daniels had sun like magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever know Billie Daniels and he said that but again you know she's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang\nJoy to the phones and this playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley\nAnd I said who's who's calling\nBut he Daniel\n\nLast September I was living in New Mexico and I had woken up in jail for like the last time\nThis was at a ... percent when this happened she was Twenty years old on drugs hanging out with street kids\nHer mom offered to buy or a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab at a said yes she took her dog and got on the bus in Los Angeles there was a stopover at the ... and this guy comes up to her while she's waiting in line to get food to two dollars just enough for some French fries the guy starts asking her questions about her dog\nAnd he started asking them questions like what do you do on where you're going to say are you from Alaska and I'm like oh yeah yeah I'm actually\nAnd your mom named Megan are like um mhm yeah she is and you're like oh well on some your father at night and years ago\nAnd I'm like oh holy\nLike um mhm yeah she is like oh well on crafts them your father like ten years ago and I'm like oh holy\nAnd it had only seen her father that one time briefly and she was eleven\nAnd then he pulled out a lot of money and like you have and my food and they have a forty bucks and it's like don't tan ever gave enough and and walk away\nThe ... [laughter] I'm like shocked by this story and he didn't know is it you didn't see him again he'd in now ... [noise]\n\nSit down and eat together and I was going to lay out my whole life story for him and he was going to play in his life but ... then it's kind of looking forward to that but in fairness\nI Want to study it face for longer scenery twice and I I still can't remember what he looks like do you regret\nNot not pursuing him in some way\nYeah absolutely moment I was just a you know I just really couldn't comprehend whether\nHow I got on the bus that I was kind of like why am I right after having lived my whole life wondering advantage you know chance to talk to him is that right in front of my age I didn't really understand that at the time and they're like oh I'm\n\nAmelia ... Garcia Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father and many years and he was seven or eight years old he lived in California but he was visiting a national park in Mexico with his mother when he was Eighteen and they had to the top of a pyramid there the whole place is sort of off the beaten track\nHer walk and walk along the ... people back to front of us have my mom said oh my God credible and she turned to me and said that's that's your father um got your dad and I was\nAlso coincidentally it was Father's Day I ended up\n[noise] um that's your dad and I was\nAlso coincidentally it was Father's Day\nI I ended up sort of thing like breaking down crying all not care man it was a really emotional moment for me and my father definitely you know a lot\nAnd we said yeah we are going to stay in contact and after they buy they left and she came running back up the hill about twenty minutes later and parenting and he said I don't know I just want to say I'm Sorry I didn't stay in touch and\nThat I Love you returned and weren't back down no no ...\nAnd early on a story goes away at a wishes hers had gone after a rocky few years he and his father did get to know each other and each other's family had a son out a grandfather million his father had left him when he was a baby when his father died some years ago a millionaire was there at the hospital\nThey had a real relationship and it never would have happened a millionaire said if he hadn't seen him that day at the paramount\nWalking down the pyramid I was talking to myself and I was saying like I don't want to advertising for ... don't you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "03"}
