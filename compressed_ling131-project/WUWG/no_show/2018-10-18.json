News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says search and that she has Native American ancestry his twenties sixteen\nOh God so as Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas Dr Volkow is not happy\nWith came from Fox

world and privacy and only trying to determine tribal citizen\nI understand and respect\nSo she had her DNA sequence which revealed Native American ancestry orange says she took the test to prove that are families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody tests for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because the Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts that were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he\nDeclined to test but from family lower wages claims to be one aids Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph Taylor has a suit pending in the Ninth Circuit because the state denied them a minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test the test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is the minority then\nThe question really you're asking is that the DNA test tell him what his identity as retell any of us would our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there are also um profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the

the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to

Brussels this week talking things over with the European Commission and you might recall back in July the president agreed to hold off on his threat to hit European auto imports with terrorists that would've been a very very big deal\nThe president agree to hold off while the two sides negotiated beer trade deal\nWell three months later both sides are now blaming the other for lack of progress on

all seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars of it last fiscal year a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year instead of majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of

his supporters there is a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that's the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his

Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIs deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIt is here as deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump have you have the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nThere were many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to feed to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly who I Am working when I build\nRelationships on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that he stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally\nIn this delegate said that he stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves boats and actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey are calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones
