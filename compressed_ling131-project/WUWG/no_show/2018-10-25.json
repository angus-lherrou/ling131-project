search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nBut I can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump they include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor in prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a air had the potential to explode here hills are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on bulbs does

u._s. should respond and become a central issue among quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron\nJohnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nIs certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way Norris\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nA A R annoyed called her national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a company children and that was found units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de be northern ... countries would have been southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners\nThat that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now true for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute\nOf course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had I I Do not have any specific\nTo evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check out a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats lawn care of and they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I want to know started the caravan\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us changed the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people are opposed to a prison hand is down there and be in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done the last two years\nWell part of my proudest treatment homeland security most of these laws aren't under my company's jurisdiction we've\nGotta do to my sister's diction because ... was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would a

gather the information fighters regret meant in our committee where you know we all agree one of the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and we don't separate families still try to go through the problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and that may be successful breeds success\n[noise] senator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\n[noise] many of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and journeys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its field competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of

News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy Clinton comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nMegan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey Audi so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or black or white kid that was okay as long as you were dressed like a character\nAnd that of course the tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one of which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nAnd also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tooth for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShows a bigger apology to folks color around the country because this is a history of going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co host of today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run a ... um that's silly and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well [laughter]\nIt's just as ignorant and resistance to statement itself ah NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge Fox News host as she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted uh a ratings uh and she had a relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figured to retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly um\nCool and conflicted reaction and and I will come from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a a Ford the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you ...\nBack in Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now and the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hate Jean Louis why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here and um we do every year old who was in fact we joke that October is blackface Avon and we had very tolerant of Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy\nAnd all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical literacy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history as this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds\nMay become central to missile shows on which why people would dress up like white people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nOf course these missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play on caricature the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... and\nIt's the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\nThere's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy sit against\nThem and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nSome of the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles cord not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that\nI mean she can claim ignorance but as lawyers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly which was talking about this and this panel is all white Pena which is important\nTo be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a store or vacuum\nAnd says intent matter since you've raised it or is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface\nWho delivering something and who's receiving it when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person in attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly in that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery in your conversation\nWill be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on blackface\nMore time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen\nBut just much Mary Louise the networks over [laughter]\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us\nFrom President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do new you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nIs so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations that goes into it\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations that goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places that so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S that when I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day than we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places\nTo make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nAmerican wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are\nNot just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them you\nKnow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIs the responsibility of the Central American government\nTheir people and I know Neal of the council on Foreign Relations so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turned up this ancient part of the brain may have been under estimate

part of the brain that let you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St

they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion

effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were way more exciting and clear than I could've ever dreamt\nThose inbox says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve

explanation father bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking cerebellum editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Sherman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of serve but I'm not talking to the thoughts with us a brain upstairs that are involved and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process sees as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of it\nIs that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its

goods from China for starters including does filter balls at ... percent it they'll need replacing in a couple of years\nAh we anticipate the cost to be twenty five to thirty percent more so we're looking at forty to fifty thousand dollars extra cost\nAnd twenty five percent tariffs on steel and aluminum the pipes are made from steel\nYou seen actual quotes from our company so we buy the steel pipes saying that the ball so increased surprised by twenty five percent\nThese price hikes are getting passed directly to consumers in the form of rate increases under water bills\nSo we're seeing
