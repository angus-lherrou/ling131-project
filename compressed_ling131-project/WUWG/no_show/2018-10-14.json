about the\nGreat actress of the second half and the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century a server and heart played by remarkable incandescent Jennings here and the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career and Eighteen Ninety seven\nHim yes that she wanted to play hamlet\nYes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea and she wants to play rewritten to strip out the poetry I Am certainly to the bottom I Am and make it more like talk and a and focus more on I guess the action\nOr yes she was somebody who is really known to be as sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the classical dancer the poetry stood in a way out of the action which in fact it does make it so I just spent\nA year working on this argument but I wasn't sure are watching the play that you bought her argument because as she says it it gets last like how dare you want to adapt

I you know I'm Glad to know the things I Know I'm Glad to have spent the time I spent studying Victorian melodrama standing Victorian theater studying Dickens you know\nI mean that was before melodrama was used almost only pejorative Lee as it is to yeah\nYou know it was the tone it was a very popular form of entertainment everybody went I became fascinated by the fact that it was a\nA culture of theatre goers you know that this theaters were huge and that also that it was a place that all classes came together to watch these plans and how was then a melodrama different from drama the score was called mount drama because everything was musically scored almost all the way through\nAnd it was highly um expressionist African gesture all a there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these tax they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural anticipated movie was trying to be a movie or name where they were it was silent movies go silent existed and also I think you can actually draw a line straight from Victorian melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and\nThere was a kind
