surrounded by reporters and cameras wet spoken\nEd make America great again hat\nSitting across from President Trump in the oval office surrounded by reporters and cameras\nWet spoken stream of consciousness passionate about everything from violence in his hometown of Chicago to prison reform to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery to his love of President Trump will give you a taste of what Kanye West pets they are part\nIt makes you feel like\nWe were man is a favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make a complete total sense out of all of this hey how ya hello let's start with the why why with Kanye even there today\nAs a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump they've been exchanging compliments for a while it really picked up after west war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live\nWhich was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat I Saturday Night live to improve on and on the liberals or improve on it if he'd all of\nWhat was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis\nOr because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump claims that west coming out in support of them has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community and now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him okay\nSo how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nTo talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focus there's some overlap with them of West interests uh Kim car dash in West\nHe's for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with some of West interest\nUh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues\nShe's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drunk then what was the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nWhat he seemed to talk about publicly was that a about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago game\nGangster disciples who is now in a supermax prison serving multiple life than it is a this is the case that is different from usually the case of the prison at Purdue reform advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh\nWho have committed non violent offenses and ah who maybe got really extreme sentences\nUh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for west and drop\nAll right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I said thank you [noise]\nNow than it is that we keep seeing here are of complete destruction but can you can you give us a more accurate scale of the damage right now\nYou know there is no counter anything but the kinds of things they're facing there's a water boil notice so you can't but you can't really\nBlew your water if you don't have power um unless you have a way to set up a fire so those kinds of problems are what are facing people\nAll right That's NPR's Debbie Elliott in Panama City Florida thank you daddy\n[noise] to welcome\nTo another story now millions of Americans post our ancestry information on line new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in on relatives who may have committed a crime

eighties the golden St killer finally\nSince last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect first series of brutal rapes and murders and California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties as a\nTo think Heller finally the cash for California investigators ... match dot ... has changed the angel out at the fact that he is now in the west side to try to identify and the ... state killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify a relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as a beat corner that illuminate hundreds of them say that these so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these debates as to actually identify you\nThe same way that it ... than you there's multiple like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd early use those same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThe technique doesn't only can get your premium although you can catch criminals with these techniques but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either to commit\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police the currency is using these techniques do find it really like you know ... and ... people\nBut uh we okay we've using this technique to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift do DNA behind a wheel K really if foreign governments are going to exploited the quake to identify us for their own purposes so that many scenarios that you can think about me even\nNow many people defending the use of these techniques\nPlease do it and if I used to do this for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me\nYou know many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen grey tech works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect and murders of children things like that is just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd ... says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law\nProfessor and it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings or you're getting cut and for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it is and misused\nRob Stein NPR News\nOn MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was fascinated\nSalvador in Nineteen eighty Romero was a dedicated champion of the poor and marginalized tomorrow the Catholic Church will make him think you can hear that story tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by

just back her first big solo trip overseas\nShe went on a safari in Kenya she stopped by the pyramids in Egypt she also visited babies in a hospital in Guyana and schoolchildren in Malawi CNN reporter Kate been it was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now Kate how\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for the exactly this is our first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda as well\nIt was first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for\nExactly this is our first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda\nWell I mean she says she was there to spread the message about the best which has her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with usa ID on some of the programs they're putting your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly as as you partnered with them on this trip it was also cultural tour she wanted to\nLearn more about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid does was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa a nation that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps saying some derogatory comments about what she wanted to do with say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher her wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does a and Mrs Trump weighed in on that she said she wishes people would quit talking about her close\nEye on what I Do not laugh but keeping\nIt it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's wearing the tests helmet\nThe film and I think was something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a scribe what she wasn't she wore a very sort of out of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on safari in Kenya\nAnd included for the safari portion white pets helmet which for Africans\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily something that they like to recall a nine to ... century ... ruled by outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we tried to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she's tweeting as she wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering up the east wing the first lady fulltime I think about that and what does the news value in ...\nVery Private First lady you or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what does the news value in reporting on the first lady you know people say well what do you do you cover the first lady she doesn't do anything and it's sort of an interesting argument\nUm she does she does it with a smaller staff\nWith a smaller footprint um which is not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had for me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who ironically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian stinks everywhere in front of the things that kept the instinct\nI'm Still in that way it is very interesting and I think that we we can't I Can't report what is she thinking but at the same time we need to accept that we need to understand her

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what performers and local leaders are trying to do a difference that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's\nHad a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign bend the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI Am director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out or to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there\n[noise] so what that means it turns out the opposition be minister\nRation is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk kid works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says\nThe widespread stopping and ... and potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion as contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nHadn't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nUh if they wanted to have a role that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nReform as a word as just\nThe consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just his money and lives those stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nI mean if we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more police so\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like a movie and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ...

you nice to be talking with you also\nFeel this was going to be American they hate the first time into the ... seconds for like the scene and what kind of training with they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause went on for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut\nWas a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched they might working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and\nThe way that crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to al Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back their\nLand would be the next chance you could go on a mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine the psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information and people will be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then\nYou can set a timeline is that in three months from now then no big deal but if it's gonna take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship stay sex is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those\nPeople to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were backing to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want okay if they ... to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nI stock they also have to you\nAs a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] and

Jim ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nBecause there's still strike you as puzzling now I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this acts\nSee that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened to know where the Turkish officials say it did [noise] yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario [noise]\nSaturday ...
