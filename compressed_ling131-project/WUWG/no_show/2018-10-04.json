guesses are can be pretty good lots of new jobs a new low low rate on unemployment which becomes a big deal when you think about this we're getting old so close to the holiday hiring season writing given the strength of the economy that debris was just talking about\nHoliday sales are expected to be pretty strong too which means stores are going to be busy which means\nThey're going to have to

are starting to raise wages to attract seasonal workers they're also offering incentives like signing bonuses additional training in more employee discounts\nI Believe one of the companies out there was even thinking of providing a four one K.\nBut even though the unemployment rate is so low there are still plenty of people willing to take on more work\nThe workers are often people who are worthless second or third jobs\nAs economists three secular do she at the new school she says stores no that higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income\nIs really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics\nHigher pay could cut into profits for retailers and gift buying more\nThat higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income\nIs really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics\nHigher pay could cut into profits for retailers and gift buying more expensive for shoppers but look these are good problems to have the national Retail Federation said holiday sales are expected to jump by more than four percent this year economists Sarah house at Wells Fargo says workers are benefiting to\nThe ... this week with Amazon increasing their minimum wage we target and Walmart increase the level that they're bringing in worker and\nShe says retailers could ask employees to work longer hours instead of bringing more people on that would be good for

selections right here I'm hoping it up as you can hear [noise] great\nFirst I Want to ask you what do you think are the brand attributes of marketplace when you think of your listeners if you were to

are deeply informative we are relevant and we are engaged and engaging listening to talk about that I'm just\nAnd this is the exciting thing about working with brand is is that your definition matched

somebody do you have the c._e._o. of few robots sitting there saying yes this is it no it isn't it\nAbsolutely the best way we can tell we're being successful is when the scent is not\nBeing delivered

really extremely rare for people to change their mind after procedurals like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have the right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because vice president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker than a final bill comes about thirty hours later I mean sometimes maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican a doozy of a jumped over the last month perhaps because of count them all do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats had great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from the Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd just today Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and I'm the mustard North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet\nYou know kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this isn't a state of North Dakota All right that's right and I mean a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may fade if God get confirmed will you will see NPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much shame Neal Well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed\nNine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination chat letting them went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you felt that this farm did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nThis year is the basic by was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new [laughter]\nGiven the student who ... on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\n[laughter] let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you\nKnow I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think there's been a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from an\n\n...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace but there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey Ari\nShows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nBut actually if you look at it from the standpoint the macro economy it's a great sign what a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nWhen you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity\nAre options elsewhere leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are you know\nThis has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nA it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they thought
