office this afternoon\nYet so you had President Trump seated in the middle next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo oh who had worked to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom\nWill what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\nRegimen type ... on a he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen uh that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Brunson um that release came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nKnow these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good\nIn anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one\nUh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship\nI'm Janine hurts\nWith these headlines the American pastor who had been detained in Turkey is back in the United states and President Trump welcomed him to the White House today praising Turkey's leaders for his release and are Brunson is the north Carolina pastor who was imprisoned in Turkey for nearly two years\nIn Florida officials are warning the death toll from hurricane Michael will likely climb further at least fourteen people are now confirmed dead the latest

Marisol Meraji in Georgia\nAllegations of voters depression or grabbing headlines in a tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists their ceiling can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold the majority of those applications belong to a black residents [laughter] we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark nice he he's a government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match\nOr pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously\nOver this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that they fly disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African\nYeah well it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters\nSeventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to the ...\nHis opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process that secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists and\nWe have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing and\nElections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote\nAnd follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just since the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now still close the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on\nVoting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp used\nThat with my ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop

... that\nSarah Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by date and which he inhabits Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former pen from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens what do I think of it\nSex worker from Trinidad a former him from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens\nWhat do I think a prostitution you're sitting mayor ...\nWhat are you Twenty years ago the use of my God my purse [laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program\nThank you for having me and us we're meeting here [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much\nBut is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are\nYou know there's a a man who's object to find women who's a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by\nMy parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media and I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags\nYou know when I was in college I thought about stripping as kind of a you know the it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my\nPre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of country back mowers to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just\nWith rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent [noise]\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accent that English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always paying every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show ... went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed called her background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said\nBut it got cracking good job or she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to set my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified huh\nIn the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\nHuh what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with ... with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white and on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nAnd we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilty [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter]\nYou know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of ... them within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like well what is it which is in Utah white you this that and I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[laughter] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah\nThanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod
