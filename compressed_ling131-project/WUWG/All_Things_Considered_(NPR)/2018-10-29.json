a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's I used to Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello [laughter] so the White House there's of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language

Andrew Gillum calling him with beef without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the metro what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nAnd it's very hard to tell A People's views are ... seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get

considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat tell us an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents are shown to see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will ban see these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise said something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is the fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh this goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no\nWith migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves to a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and it was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\nUm you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with mine\nThese so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\nHum you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms as far as which others would it be carrying arms or of any others we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past in getting into a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who were doing everything I get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents so yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq in right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said of border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments at the Pentagon thank you You're welcome\nIn their quest to win back the house of representatives

Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change and trade but he also largely voted to back the president to doubt when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for
