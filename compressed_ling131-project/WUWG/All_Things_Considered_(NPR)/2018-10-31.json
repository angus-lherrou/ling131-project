Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked is seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume it's fictitious invader is Russia earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the

the last midterm election in twenty fourteen that's in part to a highly watched tightly contested gubernatorial race between Democrat Stacey Abrams Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nAlso on all Georgia ballots this year or seven constitutional amendments and state wide referenda\nCPB Steven Fowler sat down with CPB Cindy hill to explain\nNow it's this year or so seven constitutional amendments and statewide referenda CPB Steven Fowler sat down with CPB Cindy hill to explain what you'll be voting on even there are a lot of different things that are on people's ballads depending on where they live but he's questions are there for everyone and why is that important well\nFive of the questions amend the state constitution and two of them are referendum these were passed by the state legislature by a two thirds majority\nAnd in addition to conversations like you and I are having the secretary of state's office has a summary of each of the questions to boil down all the legal language and it's on your sample ballot at your counties elections website as well\nIt's also important to note there are special questions for different city and county elections you need to check out as well like a potential cap on property taxes in Atlanta or earlier Sunday alcohol sales in many places across the state which is a constitutional on that and that has been getting the nice detention\nWell I'm going to say all of them should be getting some scrutiny because they are all on the ballot but the most funded measure as amendment for commonly known as ... law\nGeorgia is one of several states they could adopt this measure the put several rights for alleged victims into the state constitution like uh the right to be notified when hearings or other legal matters happen as being bankrolled by software billionaire named Henry Nicholas\nWould basically much of this is already state law proponents of the measure hope putting it in the constitution will give it more weight\nA boat Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the candidates for governor support the measure but there are questions opponents say it could violate due process for those accused of a crime by giving equal weight to an accuser before someone that's even found guilty\nSpeaking of courts in the legal process there's also an amendment that would create a special business court how could they changed the way that complex cases are handled\nThe the biggest thing here Cindy is that there would be a separate avenue just for companies to hash out those business disputes the thought here is that a judge in a business court but only deal with business cases and they would have more expertise than a judge who does a little bit of this a little bit of that but the main opposition comes from how\nThese judges would fill the bench this amendment allows the governor to appoint judges who were then confirmed by state judiciary committee's other judges around the state our elected and on the subject of business the Fifth Amendment on the ballot would affect counties that have more than one school district think Atlanta public schools in Fulton County schools\nThose places would remove requirement that all the school districts have to sign off on it\nOh it would affect counties that have more than one school district think Atlanta public schools and Fulton County schools\nThose places would remove requirement that all the school districts have to sign off on an education sales tax to simplify the process a little\nBit now said to him and that that deal with George's natural resources in taxes correct amendment one took about ten years to get to this point if passed the state would take eighty percent of existing sales taxes on sporting goods and other outdoors he type goods to create the Georgia outdoor stewardship trust fund\nEstimates say it would take about two hundred million dollars in the next decade to either buy things like public land or take care of things we have already\nSo if I buy a fishing pole or a surfboard or something like that some of the money that would go to conservation efforts basically but like all spending things there's a catch if the economy starts doing terribly there is a provision that would move that money back to the general pot [noise]\nThe other amendment we haven't touched on is a timber tax or more specifically how the timber tax works are friends of the Atlanta Journal constitution provide a little history lesson in their explainer large timberland owners get big tax breaks in the states sends a similar amount to those local governments missing out on the tax\nThis amendment would put the state in charge of assessing taxes on these timberland owners while also trying to lower the tax burden the official summer he doesn't make it much clearer quote encourages the conservation sustainability and longevity of Georgia's working forests through tax sub classification and grants yeah that's a pretty broad\nLast least even what are the two statewide referendum about these two are a little simpler referendum a would give a homestead exemption for people living in a place that straddles multiple

Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants\nLet's take excellence in the digital age is all\nThings considered from NPR News I Know the Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic and the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries that first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut this is a kind of me also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on and late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nFall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they ... and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda that President placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the u._s.\nConned me but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S [noise] and we couldn't sing pot contracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blimps their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little time\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorbs the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast\nBrings us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two she lives in

why this was happening loved one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nTo one thing that comes along with ... list on customers they live on that uh you're fired from a high end consumption which means that you can take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banks\nMeans that you can take a speed train you can fly China started\nThe block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of this was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his accounts and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when the odd one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big building\nAnother and more and\nBe electric screen or by the side of the ... plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar [laughter] and I saw my my pictures and that's going to have a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is an trustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town she says whenever\nHe went out whenever you see the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up for one day when he was doing that she saw the face of someone he knew\nOr a lot of money to do with all of our own resources we ... them to go to the same industry as I did get a you know there are\nThere and started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to she started getting people together meeting up for dinner she says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nOn civil about blood donor because actually\nFriday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people to think why are you cured been happy why do we used to have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far loud wand says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go\n... says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this and by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will keep paying off

to and we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people because people

compare those two approaches six hundred women in total volunteered for this worldwide study overseers stop the study early after noticing a significant enterprising different\nPatients who underwent the minimal invasive surgery had four times greater likelihood of returns then uh when they had the surgery through the open approach\nThey were also more likely to die in the next four years where mirrors as surgeons at Mt Anderson immediately changed their treatment for early cervical cancer\nWe decided to stop offering them minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and are completely convert to

coauthor Emma Barbara physician at Northwestern university says already national guidelines are being change\nDirecting doctors to discuss the benefits and risks of these two options\nI think increasingly that's going to be open surgery for many women but there may still be a role for men and ... surgery and some patients Richard Harris NPR News [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThings tuning into eighty eight point five ... happy Halloween\nIt's less than a week until election day next Tuesday in person early voting is already under way more Georgians are voting than the last midterm election in twenty fourteen [noise]\nThat is in part due to a highly watched tightly contested gubernatorial race between Democrat Stacey Abrams a Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp also on all Georgia ballots his ear seven constitutional amendments in statewide referenda\nGBDs Steven Fowler sat down with Cindy hill to explain why it will be voting on even there are a lot of different things that are on people's ballads depending on where they live\nStephen Fowler sat down with Cindy hill to explain why it will be voting on even there are a lot of different things that are on people's ballot depending on where they live but he's questions are there for everyone and why is that important\nWell five of the questions amend the state constitution and two of them are referendum these were passed by the state legislature by a two thirds majority\nAnd in addition to conversations like you and I are having the secretary of state's office has a summary of each of the questions to boil down all the legal language and it's on your sample ballot at your counties elections website as well\nIt's also important to note there are special questions for different city and county elections you need to check out as well like a potential cap on property taxes in Atlanta or earlier Sunday alcohol sales in many places across the state which is a confrontational and then that's has been getting the nice detention\nWell I'm going to say all of them should be getting some scrutiny because they are all on the ballot but the most funded measure as amendment for commonly known as Maher sees law\nGeorgia is one of several states they could adopt this measure the put several rights for alleged victims\nInto the state constitution like uh the right to be notified when hearings or other legal matters happened as being bankrolled by software billionaire named Henry Nicholas basically much of this is already state law proponents of the measure hope putting it in the constitution will give more weight\nA boat Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the candidates for governor support the measure but there are questions opponents say it could violate due process for those accused of a crime by giving equal weight to an accuser before someone that's even found guilty\nSpeaking of courts in the legal process there is also in and then that would create a special business course how could this change the way that complex cases are handled\nThe the biggest thing here Cindy is that there would be a separate avenue just for companies to hash out those business disputes the thought here is that a judge in a business court but only deal with business cases and they would have more expertise than a judge who does a little bit of it is a little bit of that but the main opposition comes from how\nThese judges would fill the bench this amendment allows the governor to appoint judges who were then confirmed by state judiciary committee's other judges around the state our elected and on the subject of business the Fifth Amendment on the ballot would affect counties that have more than one school district think Atlanta public schools in Fulton County schools\nThose places would remove requirement that all the school districts have to sign off on an education sales tax\nSimplifies the process a little bit too and then that that deal with George's natural resource\nApartment that all the school districts have to sign off on an education sales tax simplify the process a little too and that's that deal with George's natural resources in taxes correct\nAmendment one took about ten years to get to this point\nIf passed the state will take eighty percent of existing sales taxes on sporting goods and other outdoors type goods to create the Georgia outdoor stewardship trust fund\nEstimates say it would take about two hundred million dollars in the next decade to either buy things like public land or take care of things we have already\nSouth bass fishing pole or a surfboard or something like that some of the money that would go to conservation efforts basically but like all spending things there's a catch if the economy starts doing terribly there is a provision that would move that money back to the general pot [noise]\nThe other amendment we haven't touched on as a timber tax or more specifically how the timber tax works are friends of the Atlanta Journal constitution provide a little history lesson in their explainer large timberland owners get big tax breaks and the state sends a similar amount to those local governments missing out on the tax\nThis amendment would put the state in charge of assessing taxes on these timberland owners well also trying to lower the tax burden the official summary doesn't make it much clearer\nQuote encourages the conservation sustainability and longevity of Georgia's working forests through tax\nClassification and grants yeah that's a pretty broad last lease even what are the two state wide referendum about well these two are a little simpler referendum a would give a homestead exemption for people living in a place that straddles multiple counties again like the city of Atlanta\nReferendum be tweaks tax code and clarifies existing law to make sure homes for the mentally disabled are still allowed to take ads alarm tax

I'm ordered it was a thirty year three more years actually say a ...\nWhich is why Thirty years a bit of a\nIndustry standards have no idea\nThe thirty year term did not come down on a tablet engraved here that says Thirty years is the right number\nWell so much for the biblical explanation that voice of reason was Edward pinto with the American Enterprise Institute says the thirty year mortgage actually came about because of a housing crisis yet not that housing crisis one in the last century\n\nBack in the Nineteen twenties typical mortgage was for three to five years with the variable interest rates and payments only covered the interest which\nMeans that at the end of that time you owed all the money and so the big balloon payment came do at the end\nHistorian Lewis Hyman at Cornell University says at that point most people just borrowed the money again for another three to five years that work time and says as long as banks had money to lend but\nWhen the great depression hits people began to pull their money and there was a financing crisis in Nineteen thirty two for mortgages\nHundreds of thousands of people suddenly face foreclosure enter the country's

mortgages and convert them into longer term lows with payments that included interest in principle\nThen came the federal Housing Administration which insured mortgages against default and set new standards for those loans hello Fifteen your mortgage\nAndroid get teachers real estate finance at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nAnd then basically the F ha kind of keeps pushing it to Twenty years and then twenty five and then thirty\nFor buyers predictable payments over a long period of time made homeownership more affordable but for banks a thirty year mortgage with a fixed interest rate didn't make a lot of sense the interest they had to pay to depositors and to borrow money wasn't fixed\nSo in the Nineteen seventies Congress took care of that problem it authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from lenders taking the risk off their books\nSo again we have some government intervention that okay I I have no problem making thirty are alone because I Know Fannie and Freddie or in a by it\nAnd that in a nutshell is how the thirty year mortgage became king but maybe it shouldn't be don't forget\nThe thirty year term did not come down on a tablet engraved here that says Thirty years is the right number\nEight IEDs Edward pinto says for starters the thirty year mortgage pushes up home prices by making it easier for buyers to manage a bigger alone they end up paying a lot more interest over the life of the loan and\nThe amount of principle relatives interest is very small and it takes a very long time to build up equity\nOkay but at this point the thirty

due to a highly watched tightly contested gubernatorial race between democratic candidates Stacey Abrams a Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp libertarian Ted Mets is also in the race also on all Georgia ballots this year seven constitutional amendments in statewide referenda\nCheap it'd be Stephen Fowler sat down with Cindy hill to explain\nWhat you'll be voting on even there are a lot of different things that are on people's ballots depending on where they live these questions are there for everyone and why is that important well five of the questions amend the state constitution and two of them are referendum\nAnd with these questions are there for everyone and why is that important well five of the questions amend the state constitution and two of them are referendum\nThese were passed by the state legislature by a two thirds majority and in addition to conversations like you and I are having the secretary of state's office has a summary of each of the questions to boil down all the legal language and it's on your sample ballot at your counties elections website as well\nIt's also important to note there are special questions for different city and county elections you need to check out as well like a potential cap on property taxes in Atlanta or earlier Sunday alcohol sales in many places across the state which is a confrontational and then that's has been getting nicer attention\nWell I'm going to say all of them should be getting some scrutiny because they are all on the ballot but the most funded measure as amendment for commonly known as Maher sees law\nGeorgia is one of several states that could adopt this measure that puts several rights for alleged victims\nInto the state constitution like uh the right to be notified when hearings or other legal matters happened as being bankrolled by software billionaire named Henry Nicholas would basically much of this is already state law proponents of the measure hope putting it in the constitution won't give it more weight\nA boat Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the candidates for governor support the measure\nBut there are questions opponents say it could violate due process for those accused of crime by giving equal weight to an accuser before someone is even found guilty of courts in the legal process there's also an amendment that would create a special business course how could this change the way that complex cases are handled\nThe the biggest thing here Cindy is that there would be a separate avenue just for companies to hash out those business disputes the thought here is that a judge in a business court but only deal with business cases and they would have more expertise than a judge who does a little bit of it is a little bit of that but the main opposition comes from how\nThese judges would fill the bench this amendment allows the governor to appoint judges who were then confirmed by state judiciary committee's\nOther judges around the state our elected and on the subject of business the Fifth Amendment on the ballot would affect counties that have more than one school district think Atlanta public schools in Fulton County schools\nThose places would remove requirement that all the school districts have to sign off on an education sales tax said simplify the process of little faith in there and say to that deal with George's natural resources in tax is correct amendment one took about ten years to get to this point if passed the state will take eighty percent of existing sales taxes on\nGeorge's natural resources in tax is correct\nAmendment one took about ten years to get to this point if passed the state but take eighty percent of existing sales taxes on sporting goods and other outdoors type goods to create the Georgia outdoor stewardship trust fund\nEstimates say it would take about two hundred million dollars in the next decade to either buy things like public land or take care of things we have already\nSouth bass fishing pole or a surfboard or something like that some of the money that would go to conservation efforts basically but like all spending things there's a catch if the economy starts doing terribly there's a provision that would move that money back to the general pot [noise]\nThe other amendment we haven't touched on is a timber tax or more specifically how the timber tax works are friends of the Atlanta Journal constitution provide a little history lesson in their explainer large timberland owners get big tax breaks in the states and the similar amount to those local governments missing out on the tax\nThis amendment would put the state in charge of assessing taxes on these timberland owners while also trying to lower the tax burden\nThe official summer he doesn't make it much clearer\nQuote encourages the conservation sustainability and longevity of Georgia's working for us through tax\nClassification and grants yeah that's a pretty broad last least even what are the two state wide referendum about well these two are a little simpler referendum a would give a homestead exemption for people living in a place that straddles multiple counties again like the city of Atlanta\nReferendum be tweaks tax code and clarifies existing law to make sure homes for the mentally disabled are still allowed to take ... tax exemption\nThat was deeply these Steven Tyler speaking with Cindy hill you can read more
