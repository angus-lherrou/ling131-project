today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago\nThe auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nThe motion all [noise]\nI'm sure it is\nIt's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nAre sick I get sick sick being\nJust the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here [noise]\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed dumps get more was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and took a buyout\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburb\nBeautiful here yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still\nThere are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing the oil is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and then we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies that eighty so you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes approving everything\nA little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year then\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different feel bad about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant close\nTo the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life [noise]\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent he used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and wants doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him [noise]\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nNot going to say a big percentage of them in and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after\nPeople that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their footing Peyton started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen the had that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me and say hey here's a good job you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just living normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down during a little bit\nPain has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there

go to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run and what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area\nThe current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that day\nHe drove him sick hurting the freeway Lou\nEntering our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly

overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that

west of town patrolling private ranch land he got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week he\nSaid quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n[noise] we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling\nIn July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase that's a huge growth how our border agents handling that [noise]\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me\nThat's an eighty percent increase

logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed\nImmigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse president\nTrump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nRight the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary move the U.S recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted to travel ban then he'll give his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders

to put these six day of October is always to have your long everybody\nThe number of the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew in the summer quarter July through September much because you knew there was going to be a buck numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be one Neal Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios\nThe numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be\nOne Neal Richardson from ... from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody Hi tai\nChi and let me start with you uh and and in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report\nIt is a good number yeah\nThe headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had flowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the tax man's and we're seeing a slow down I'm so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts and the stimulus and the and the stimulus or if you will of what's going on\n... down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus it feeds into and strong regrets and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent and this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now things are looking good economically speaking in as good as Katherine said because the consumer is cut I hear some trepidation do in your voice Noah [noise] you know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week\nIs there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates and ... and those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for disasters ahead okay\nNot to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out will will ah [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and terrorists and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point one day to day and said we're going to get billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but\nTrade and tariffs and he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and sisters we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the terrorists aren't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants if the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business groups when I've talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nAnd other running from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once called the fed uttered budget pal or his biggest the economic problem\nI'm even as a German ... told me back in June ... even as the fed doesn't pay any attention what the president says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer [noise] um and the fed might be thinking about ... what does this kind of ... due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how to keep the economic bull market running how to keep economic growth and and step flow still normalizing policy because when in us\nAnd we know that it will be aware and eventually the next recession hits he wants to make sure that he his took that as a fully ready to to stop a the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates as a very effective tool the\nFed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession and they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increased and short term interest rates from zero\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and that that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart the his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for pork\nBill Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city so I think ... I have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to end it up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while some things have felt this chopping rent will have the details when we do the numbers\nAre back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty lumber credit where credit's due\nTo dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would've seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at S P global\nWhat you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth\nBut he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which\nDown the road this macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax reform for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\n\nBase is marketplace I'm tired result there's one gets filed street into the I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the business Susan Decker is the ... reporter for Bloomberg walked in the program\nYeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\n... old school sometimes is the better the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's ... it's it's reliable and its stores the heck of a lot of data\nYeah Jason cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's terabytes is equivalent to about a million bucks right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there was a corporate store you're right there's\nYou know tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there's a corporate story you're right there's it's Sony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my passions in Latin inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints that the international Trade Commission and here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT see saying please don't shed either of them out uh we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan and so there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's a lot of his anatomy that shuts down operations and\nGive me the upshot of all these ah suits encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent and teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies [noise] trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard to put ever more stuff on these tapes so if only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\n[noise] let's say about it I mean if you have software\nAnd there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow Susan Decker she's the ... a correspondent at a Bloomberg\nTakes a lot of pressure to\nAssociation comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we as Americans spend more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets full disclosure part of that came from me about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us\nTo the point to a series called my economy help people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here you go\nMy name's ...
