and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities mean hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you a sense of this anger will linger and the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and and just listen to

now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage\nTo come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that our goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat happened so what what does she want to happen now well I think\nShe didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise] I\nOr things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe just have

McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense that this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhich is over some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified cue you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist but defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke or the officers said that driving into the situation\nOf evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues to have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released in the shooting the department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen\nThere is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promises in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here at\n... she's the host of sixteen shots such a podcast
