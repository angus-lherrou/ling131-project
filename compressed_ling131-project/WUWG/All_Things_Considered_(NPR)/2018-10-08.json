on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I

could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement [noise]\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nA steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of re her to take more left leaning political positions now [noise] I think it\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive\nAnd when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still had those country than she did still want to appeal to them but I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure rating her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as a mystery of the day and I always had that I had her mind immediately exactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she'd just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of a looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd well she didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when it kind of music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in and meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post

Philadelphians died of overdoses most of them died alone in the year twenty seven [laughter] highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop in\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York to Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection site but having done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use [noise]\nIt's a physician shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection sites in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engage in that activity remain vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement measurements arose inside [noise] common incorporate or a safe injection site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\n... says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis\nBut offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely rama gold fine with the AIDS project in Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get in to treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district in ...\nYou support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington very acute Sanchez is still on the phone\nCan talk about the injection site as a tool\nOn a recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and Trump bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes next to Delhi's leaning against our cars this is how forty two year old ray describes were using just his first name because he uses illegal opioids\nBrand new ground zero of ... man it's it's just crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts I have a baseball cap\nWhile he says he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses much carbon in our way back yard or anywhere\nElse officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors\nBut one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray off the streets and into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration so be it\nFor NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology that's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how the queue or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement as also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nAnd she would do really quite well with well controlled facial images and one of the nation is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task [laughter] you know one recurring issue though we\nKeep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas [noise]\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that\nHappen yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right\nSo how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple\nIf you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make\nThe Web on race bias that's a harder question so easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um\nHis face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by society\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility is something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you\nFor all tech considered comes from the three I

this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three three meals a day seven days away super fancy meals they're cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to uh\nPrize if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away and\nDoesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been\nOrganizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments and now I Do you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there and if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's this in media push back\nRight to end which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights have spent decades to stay there isn't what and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made [noise]\nYes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out of formaldehyde when outsell a silicon said went out bar acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these out\n... extremely dangerous compound [noise] is this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation [noise]\nPart because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to\nThe uh the before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who you stand up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference\nSo I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison squad one kind of a single minded crusade for food safety or turn up the twentieth century thanks for talking with
