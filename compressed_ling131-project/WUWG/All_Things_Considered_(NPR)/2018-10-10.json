U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ... correct\nIs as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show to capture him\nThe initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably to show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these ... they weren't ... what my\nSources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn showed ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn if the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is\nAnd Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there is a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that they said ministry in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin Oman who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure with in many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard they he replaced the he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\n... have been some honor and be SSU sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there was a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hope for the weekend or overturn roe the wait at Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme\nCourt can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon enhance the c._e._o. of the conservative\nThat would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

A. also from ... to\nOr not so one one significant things some of the classic legacy pioneering rap acts\nAren't playing big venues are a lot of questions actually come out of that the first is I'm going to a live show is is a disposable income kind of thing right [noise]\nDo rock and roll show fans tend to have more disposable income than the folks who would go to see say and the way it is the case that the younger fans of hip hop have less disposable rash so what happens is the economics for an act like juice world who's on top of their charts with this song lucid dreams right now\nAre different ... ... if you had this lengthy sprawling tour hitting\nA second tier third tier of cities across the U.S it's not going to work because there aren't enough people to come to that show where maybe a rock act who has older fans with more cash in their pocket\nCan make the economics work um [noise] so let's go back even farther ... eventually Mick Jagger is going to die and eventually rock and roll fans now were fifty and sixty and remembering in front of you are going to stop going has actually changed the dynamic\nMany people I've talked to feel like this is an elephant in the room for the live music industry and\nUm once the Rolling Stones Paul McCartney is go it is a question Ken than you are acts replace the older acts and Kennedy newer acts in their old age\nGender the kind of money that the stone to remember the Rolling Stones back in the seventies they didn't make that much money from albums and even lived the make more money now than than they ever did back in the day too with the question is is that a historical anomaly\nChai tied to rock in the twentieth century\nOr not and one way that the industry is shifting its place in a little bit more focus on\n... chai tied to rock in the twentieth century or not and one way that the industry is shifting\nIts place in a little bit more focused on festivals and on smaller venue right and and then you roll all of that\nIn with streaming and subscription downloads and other ways that people can get beside the law but then right and it all changes right near shot the wall Street Journal no actual facts\n[noise]\n\nSwallowed\nAnnoy all day in which the future of health care is revealed or\nWell okay that's not entirely true but at the end anyway this morning the department of justice gave a preliminary go ahead to CBS the pharmacy chain by me insurance giant Aetna for a tidy sixty nine billion dollars American money\nCould turn out to be a big deal and help people get their health care actually imagine a pharmacy for a second not just as a place you go to get to page but with an inhouse clinic perhaps some kinds of routine treatments as well it's a pharmacy benefit company owning an insurance company\nThey supported by hacker one housing organizations reduced risk of cyber security incident I partnering with trusted hackers to find him take software vulnerability before criminal can exploit them more at hacker one dot com\nBy foreign X. dot com for Exxon comic committed to empowering and helping traders teeth opportunities and the foreign exchange marketing learn boring for Exxon calm for X. dot com is your World Trade and orange training involve significant risk of law\nAnti intercom business entertaining platform who's chat on automate manual sales and marketing half my qualifying leave them scheduling demos learned more in an intercom dot com\nRight we are on our way to do do throws up eight hundred and thirty one points day that is three and a jump back down three Fifteen that is four percent ... five hundred dollar Ninety four points three and two tenths present there remember the CPI consumer price index tomorrow inflation\nInflation at the consumer level Derek Gore she drew jobs that ...
