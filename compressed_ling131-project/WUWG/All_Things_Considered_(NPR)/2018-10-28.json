I I don't know what to do\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to leave the flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child [noise]\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue and this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified\nAnd I hope that we could make some changes to such an attack on the Jewish people but at the attack\nOn everybody in a community and market are strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd others that she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both so you know this was many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorial\nTree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that\nUp so what do they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime [noise] well I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and in Lisa ... the aunt she mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels\nWell I just heard so much sadness much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws I\nThink about the definitely need to have gotten lines but we definitely don't need to have you know security guard at our school at our temple that our churches\nPush and a half to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how thoughts and prayers to that but where we go to ... it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right\nBut you also getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah I think ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life then I got the ...

people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestling circles so Lugar said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and bunch\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we must put those prayers

of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind they started here because I'm
