are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe anything that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports when\nAnd how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges set extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied\nThe work of a better word they kinda look like ... bars they're stretched out reduce that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt declining and it's all good wanting me up\nOn it means a lot a lot\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis face still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet\nThat this won't be the last word male Greenfieldboyce NPR

for the British and European economies have for the U.S George Packer has written about this he's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program polar if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell it could be caught severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where everybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very ... don't you and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nEverybody ended up throwing plates and each other in person left to you in very bad don't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border say you would have\nImmediately you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that would quickly to huge accused of the ... coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on a seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very tail shaken damaging appetite for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines fairs the fresh food road could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big hits\nYou're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYup there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you ... the place where there are no ... for the moment you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\n[noise] well the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more\nBureaucracy in red tape the borders and that would have to business costs it would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market potential fatalities as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years the u._k. economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as a bit of kittens that sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe UK leaves without a deal\nFor for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such the scenario to play out because the person as a major destination for European exposed so that would be an effect on all manner\nIdea that's your wouldn't allow such the scenario to play out because the person as a major destination for European expose so that would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a new one produces in France cop produces in Germany\nHum you name it they they will be effective because the u._k. off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that to other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nBritain vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite to the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it\nTo have very divided policy back in London and I think she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my basis I'm Still despite all the negative noises around is a common sense will prevail I'm there will be a deal at the end of the day [noise]\nTowards Parker is a political editor

it makes a mistake that recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nSpoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with over when we look we focus on the

this relationship how can repair said the trust between ...\nBy there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenue by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to Ben in the future it it don't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result those those people punished uber more than than the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may ... bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for your ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your ears and

as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference\nNate eons want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be let in to the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint hats in the past\nAnd mission of illegal drug use our guards around be found in the midst of all in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal\nAs we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state\nBut they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what rules should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nTo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle or on you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour winds a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks\nFrom the beach the garage doors shaking\nLike somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew there were if I'd gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I say that everything was going to be okay when\nLast doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the\nSame can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach\nBut his home is largely intact the\nSame can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nBut this is a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida family any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that sort of a ruse down as you go further north Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of post war was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nA jihadist store back in and out particularly yet Michael back it is going to force a much higher when load climate for the coast well in land based on that\nYeah that store back in and out ... yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher in global climate or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be proven ... eighties

questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nIs defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\nKelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me\nKelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she was a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see missions policies change not to have racing at\nHarvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that consider it's complicated ... students life experiences once you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering wanted assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raised to sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard saying that they don't do that but once and for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yet and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish application says well then sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of the argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process or should\nEat and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school back around and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at merit in the context of race but again like I said\nMarried in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the ... benefits of it are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to realizing admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell tell me about of all

nastier is if China started selling off some of the American directed at all till march Bush Tracey Samuelson looks at the likelihood that might happen\nThe U.S government spends more each year than it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back\nIn two thousand seven we are now dependent upon China and how do you get tough on your banker thing is China's stockpile of treasury bonds is a very small fraction of the total us debt\nAbout five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan\nI think the notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not they're alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years to the question is really with China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is more\nPointed then I think people initially

considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry but watch it a company do when it makes a mistake that recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar\nAbout why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with over so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues that one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue by one to two percent which we tested apologies and of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but which\nI mean just I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to Ben in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... and do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and that as a result\nThose those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect ... or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know when we enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what what are the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages is money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may backfire to it was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ... years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your ears and flowers\nAnd flowers and candy takes on a whole new significance um does it has it changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question they do I'm curious\nI think the main way to change that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always be skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest him since you're in a more souls and people are always just like oh you're just\nAnd they would always be skeptical whenever I Apologize so after like go an extra mile to sort of felt like earnest and there are more souls
