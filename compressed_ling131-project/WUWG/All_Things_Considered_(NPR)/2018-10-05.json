Kavanaugh is now one step away from my seat on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote\nTomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy for speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\nPresumption of innocence and in fairness to bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThan for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believe the charges against Kavanaugh should not be prevented him from serving on the Supreme Court or conclusion\nMr President I Will vote for judge cabinet\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee All right we're going to bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today Hey Kelsey either high so I Want to ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one notes that picking on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen between now and that it happened you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role but he might have had to play had it had it not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and the links for speech has already just said a didn't appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing artist\nAppear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nTo two two forty seven eighty eight before time runs out and thank you so much\nTime is about to run out typically we see the get the greatest

I had\nBy the way he acted like you know I ...\nI think that response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the\nAt the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople weighing in continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice Molly forward\nShore I one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know no obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people question her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remark he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate\nBut to that specific remark he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had are Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things to do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to senator ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and we're taking gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats ... you know when you you'd be some of them and gates and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you\nTo be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U. S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report to the news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate huge and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nTop concern right here in front and players if they can't find more that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the ...\nScrambling that top concern or hearing front and players if they can't find for her that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has found significant implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFour point ... percent over the last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down the slow the people who benefit are disproportionately those at the bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the market told me up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts in trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who is senior economist\nAt the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates are said you know look I'm getting too low I have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists it would have started to swim on the brakes she'd be unemployed alone five percent or they never would have allowed to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have Johnny ...

rebel writes for the Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones ...\n... ... jobs ... you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that a drug important was actually doing a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but the people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still an again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be the markets for those who have that right at wages wages where the focal point and what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than than last\nMonth that but some growth that two point eight percent it was enough grounds to spark some concern in the market that this would spill over to the consumer and prices and and and prompted inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and growth was enough\nTo concern the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me put it but a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is some amazing to me that it was only five days ago that we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA\nA China is still out there uh we have a still a president or who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking it we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with terrorists and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built on\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know uh I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure uh is kind of a deal there that that Trump did not break globalization despite\nA relief that the existing structure uh is kind of on field there that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nBut that's a good one the debris globalization meal put on your your actual certified economists at which I should point out your uh ... and a poet bad for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talked about what Catherine we're talking about this idea that\nWe are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics here being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing which is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right and let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China\nAnd the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired\nThe continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet um it's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they said right in the middle of\nYou

senator from Maine that using facts and vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nJoe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know Monday or Tuesday I Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done right there are budget that I have to get down there are\nSocial programs and and a former bills and all of that stuff still has to be done [noise] thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller\nBut I have to get done right there are budget that I have to get down there are social programs and and a former bills and all of that stuff still has to be done [noise] thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller word is things were to say that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage our and and the presidency is well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis uh\nTen years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nNewer to you quickly please sure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting we're seeing some wage growth\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as is part of a natural business cycle that's when the government plays a role and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by
