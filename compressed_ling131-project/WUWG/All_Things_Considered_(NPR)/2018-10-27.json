Michelle Martin broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue and Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia he may have hurt other colleagues some NPR under wrote this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nPennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought with secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night\nThough Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house because we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's and they're on what's on their minds this election year\nTo help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY is Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and\nThank you so much for hosting us and thanks to all the people who offers pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Dave Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the Baltics of estate me and for the last six years Pennsylvania's ... have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shaved and generally acknowledge to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of the gerrymandering suits have stalled but at a state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they big theme is playing out in congressional races across the\nAnd it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist so do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can say that name off\nWill spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle it's just character assassination if you have ever missed a tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hoped to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaign in the country in a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Bryant it's Patrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott while I was never run for office before and he's port millions of dollars at his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nDestructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI or intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen you see the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nOn a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution and the overarching issue ties all of us together is money in politics\nWater pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together as money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and I think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district done or expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tell the candidate boats and so yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that the system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nSays he's huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just\nHate the tone so he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a\nWay I mean do you see your campaign in a way or the election and in a in a referendum\nDonald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging he goes around the country saying a vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher in the presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing and don't last\nElections and the reality is this is the first chance that voters in this district in everywhere in the country to express their feelings about what they're seeing and the last thing I think anybody wants to see is ... doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things have got well just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that\nWell Scott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick does he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative as most of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nThe feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's the most motivating thing actually\nTime on the New Yorker radio our

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there hoping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Ryan ...\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point [noise]\nAh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident\nIn terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward in order to next\nThe FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nOr the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in his suspects life is home vehicle social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers recovered and assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point uh that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at it as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off us attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges in this case he says that there is no place for hatred of violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\n'cause you just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime and a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime was eleven people killed uh the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been using in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof of who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina\nThe federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and\nUltimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as ... as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there are there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the uh\nTo collect evidence there uh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiment\nAnd the alleged shooter in this case is of course a loving in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\n[laughter] that is NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you [noise] and\nOnce again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to prominent figures apparently because of their political views\nBut even before those awful event we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity\nAnd that is a message that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three I Wonder if this country's bloody as we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fats and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Thompson and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty six theme in previous years before that was very politically involved those vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nSounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this layers on cases in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same arguments ... former governor of Pennsylvania for a sexual comments carry but you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and\nTom Ridge the former governor of Pennsylvania from a section of homeland security but you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and there was and thankfully car and came up with a structure for ... what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no really\nI um I have always been pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that realizing that\nThat there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue voter but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the blind men and the the elephant which\nUm I don't know if you're familiar with the looked up ... book the expert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "27"}
