time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello Hi this is defined Mondo\nYeah he says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level

...\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural in that way so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery

crazy also these two teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game to that game for the Boston Red Sox who ... even without Babe Ruth you might have heard\nOf him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back\nThese this goalie okay with them and they matched up so it was it's also even though it's it's this historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they missed each other when they've all been in the world series it was never against each other so I\nLove the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got at torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that one seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with this spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire to get back\nIn when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said or either he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then\nReally in the case I Know it's not Clinton ... it's ... so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the daughters haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nThat Boston is that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the best\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award\nHow did that they were the best thing that baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when it all no one cares about hey you want to hide your name can you get an award you get a crowd\nAnd you don't get anything oh you get you on a hundred and ... yeah they want when they are so good out of it as well you know and the policy then you know when you got to go play All right\nI Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you

Trump Administration that led to a federal\nAnd the American civil liberties union the ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nFirst say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nThat's the question right or you know obviously they should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey are being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say over two hundred and forty five a number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've\nReached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nAbout what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me\nLook my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definitely we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nThey very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited well we're also seeing\nUnder standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find the one way or the other we believe

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some\nYou see foundation\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nStrict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of an why use\nBrennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count\nWe're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified purging has a\nPractice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\n... cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nThey're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being part from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling this voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nMany of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to blend of it not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degrees so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any for\nMany Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] manner ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise]

strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and polarizing\nWe heard about it it's been said arbitrary but what's happening with jobs were politics as literally as a family member to experiment or where wow you're that is really just started we most public\nPeggy says this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal lives and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing the sort of attack and Arizona Republican Congressman Paul ghosts are six siblings filmed an ad against him this election year as well\nGrace cos are Jones goes and goes or Jennifer gold star pogo SARS my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr real doctor bill

economics at UCLA and co author of politics gets personal effects of political partisanship an advertising on family ties\nWe don't actually have very good survey data on how often it is that families

the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in touch see\nThat's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so I\nThink one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nAbout what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me\nLook my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child and the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nThey very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited about what we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang\nAre people not reunited because of disorderly conduct the wires allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids were not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents\nWe are the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the farm we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director
