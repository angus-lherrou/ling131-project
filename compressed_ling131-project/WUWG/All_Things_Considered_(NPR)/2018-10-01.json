speaker to play NPR or your local station by name\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic works faster loaded the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us hailing a high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nThe over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet provider should have over your Internet access\nThat would have on ordinary people going on\nRight the overarching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers who'd have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an apt to you're visiting other elements some toxins include things like zero rating which is a deal\nWhenever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix or data or just restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step out of California has gone through one of the reaction\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nThe writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your arise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not put neutrality rules into place\nAnd are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and I think for themselves that it is a lot easier to just\nAbide by the California standard and sort of\nHow goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nOr all the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially accusing Californian legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet\nOh for any legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it so what does this mean for consumers and companies will just fight plays out or not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect until January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr the tech companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorneys general including in California attorney general are suing the Federal Communications commission trying

endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you go systems are made of species we all depend on speed or food for medicines for
