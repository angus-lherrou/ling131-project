Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year a spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote\nInsurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote\nBut critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James Wally Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had\nFirst hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate back\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually it to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nCan can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of the Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized at first\nThat the papal known CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects of\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is not the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to just straight discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was the central that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guaranteed that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Brewster he wasn't passed through to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm

I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the

Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nA violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more\nThe last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs I wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us [noise] thank you for having me what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's suddenly what we should be looking at is not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant is that the ... percent but then when you look at the\nNumbers are we talking about four to something off his says versus said there's something officers so from my perspective it's suddenly what Dr phil fan the winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turn that we are seeing is dangerous and disturbing\nSo I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we can get an investigative activity um Wednesday handling and know peasants with mental illness so it's not the topic violations ... and ... no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nNew thing that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nThe people who see police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn jail now the climate on in the last few years because of that on the police and the United states [laughter] so when when you put the two together and the ... tourist violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it\nPolicing United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it during event then you have to cut us off it out\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea than the steps of the Supreme Court he was saying police officers is pushing back to demonstrate that was so ... looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police also because it kind of take you out and get out to be on a given police station instead you you're doing it against a poet prevent the tip of the government who is a police officer\nBefore you conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us [noise]\nUm ... when we're looking at those on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the activities and is definitely\nA training issue also so frequently a seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that to\nMe it's always the reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this is a tactical issue is how you\nApproach and the ... and how we are close to house a well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous I mean that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies\nAnd when you have Eighteen thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment and stand up for training which would help us make gay the negative and of of policing 'cause the profession he\nJust more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nI mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable and it nine officers in one year aren't killed in that line of duty as an outcome most premeditated took too because it was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officers\nAnd I can move to meditate tucked convicted that was directed against them explicitly not democratic society should I said to nine police offsets in one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the topic
