California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nYou know I have to ask do you think that the race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this [noise] absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that brings officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is um Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet\nOf officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of some of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were just yeah I bet someone wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not says example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening [noise]\nIt's been reported that your brother struggle\nThe designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n[noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of interest actually nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show that kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf a person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis\nIt's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\n[laughter] whenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issue their mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who shouted above the root causes a story that needed to be told\nThat have been a a Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed and\nConduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned is is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring the high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe in\nFrom all over\nWest is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic it up here I guess for land do cats do is kind of barrier\nThat iceberg for me it's still end up kind of steel there's an African American man shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to fire the baby right traditions of citizens and police officers that were last here is that people are getting the legislation shifts focus on citizens what does it\nAnd it doesn't just focus on video regardless of age for additional course content for both citizen and also pollution police academy\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we do is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get weather and the academy and the fact that ... of course is a minimum of two hours that video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the ticks to what appear to be two white teenage girls and\nThey're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white a limit\nI can police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally cannot Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the ... you know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast and you'll get fat I Can't I\nMean why is that irrelevant when they see that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the ten cent why would you let let\n... let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that uh do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nAnd interview with Sally ate was acting attorney general she said no to the so called Muslim

E. L. dot com [noise]\nAnd from the listeners who support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nWhile you've probably heard about the federalist society is Roland during that that's a conservative legal group those lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program\nIt's an hour I think ethical questions which I knew about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC this week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks which you keep that training secret and find something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us and thanks so much for joining us as going to be here [noise] so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nYou spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns [noise]\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what you can take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nYeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act\nIncluding ones that come from a particular ideological direction but not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exists to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline that perhaps the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC to create\nPipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at death\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing he does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's an extent in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot find and what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close now it's about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who was paying for it\nYou know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstitute it in a different form it's entirely possible here on the tacky covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be here [noise] finally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talk to us\nIn court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her finally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks plus he shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne report this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the re boot of the popular nineties show after star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which married this week and we learned that spoiler alert the rows and character die by way of an opioid overdose I just got a call\nFrom a friend in the coroner's office autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne deed on opioids\nPossible when you share the problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery then it was just I got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about it so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be myself
