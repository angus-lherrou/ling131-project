the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in a reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James\nAn early so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at

thousands of migrants so\nDecided they were going to march ... ... and Mexico and they said they were there and to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but you know for him just turn to summarize it as quickly as possible\nThey were ... been walking them from leaving Guatemala to got through that sends thousands of started a walking across the bridge into Mexico Mexico has a big metal gate to them it had\nDozens of federal police officers in riot gear ratings for the caravan [laughter] and I wasn't close enough to\nThe metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nAnd I wasn't close enough to be what happened but tend to Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here gas that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from his father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nThey don't want to see what they're putting on the [noise]\nHe said when she went to the front what his children because they thought they were going to let families and children Crawford chaos broke out he had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here again it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough thing speaking\nOf the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still right here near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of hot uh from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cop now he's probably four years old has a\nLot of the clothes rack and has had so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom\nAnd did you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them and\nHas asylum seeker so they are many of them say we are not going to leave us friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to have closed to every one\nSo it it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going in\n... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position\nThey they're aware that a Trump does not

were you and other reporters on the plane able to ask pump pay oh what's going on the first\n[noise] he kept his distance from us the whole day or when he was having these meetings and it was only after he had met with Mohammed didn't sell them on the young crown prince is really kind of a power broker in Saudi Arabia President Trump called in to this meeting and President Trump was the first to tweet\nWorking right now Donald Trump tweeting just moments ago just spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nTotally denied any knowledge of what took place in the Turkish causal as it was what struck a jury of state Mike Pompeo\nDuring then the state department had to put out a statement confirming that Trump had called in and that the crown prince had in fact denied that he had any knowledge of this and that the king tonight as well\nTrump soon moved on his back here in Washington again he gave an interview to the a P on Tuesday and when she compared the allegations against him ... to allegations against his Supreme Court nominee now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nHe compared the allegations against him ... to allegations against his Supreme Court nominee now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh the president's\nSaying here in a in an interview with the Associated Press quote here we go again with you're guilty until proven innocent\nOf the show column and you buy now you're left ... flown on to turkey where of course ... ... has disappeared Turkish investigators are presenting all kinds of evidence does Mike Pompeo say he's found anything out\nHe's found any facts at this point no and in fact it was astounded because we it was as we were leaving Riad we asked him point blank ... the Saudis tell you that list Washington Post columnist was dead yeah what they say he said\nI don't want to talk about any of the facts\nThey didn't want to either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation go so far away\nAnd he called that an incredible success\nI'm guessing there were some follow up questions among the press corps on the flight home as you all are headed back you flew back Wednesday from Ankara back to Washington After this mission that was not to find out the facts of what happened you land a and then the next thing we hear from the administration is we need to give to Saudis more time\nThat's right and and he did say that on the on the trip as well because we asked him about the optics of this um that it looks like business as usual with the Saudis and he insisted that he had very direct conversations that they were serious or what he also went into this long kind of an prompted defense of the relationship\nI Do think it's important that everyone keeping their mind\nFor relationships with us from Saudi company\nGovernmental relationships things we walk 'em together all across the world\nAnd particularly now as the as this administration is trying to reimpose sanctions on Iran they need the Saudis to maintain the oil markets or they need the Turks to stop buying so much crude oil from Iran so there's a lot of geopolitics here at play and this one particular case\nSo here we closed the business on friday a Seventeen Days after Jamal ... walked into that Saudi consulate in Istanbul and disappeared [noise] are we any closer to answers on the the two key questions what happened\nAnd what does the U.S going to do about it [noise]\nNot really I mean that there is a moving in Congress to push\nWhat happened\nAnd what does the U.S going to do about it [noise] not\nReally I mean there is a moving in Congress to push for at least some targeted sanctions against those people who were found to have been involved in it um and the administration has to respond to that President Trump said on the consequences are going to be theory I don't\nHave to be very bad bad um\nIf they want to give the Saudis a few more days to come up with their story and in the meantime the Turks have been leaking all kinds of information and very gruesome details about\nThis case [noise] NPR's Michel ... thank you thank you and and\nThe last word on this story for now talking to reporters today Trump

great unemployment slow we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for one time charges in those tax benefits than benefit from those tax cuts\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not

Hi I'm Jennifer ...\nIt's been a couple of get a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook page that content to users and a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot\nTo video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair well in the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what [laughter]\n... yeah basically and they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this lawsuit but maybe it didn't work out so well\nSo I mean I think our publisher and this was kind of a second cost fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these debates kind of eating into traffic\nAll right so I I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these he faced the kind of eating into traffic when Facebook says representing video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publishers say OK how high and so they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is so this happened to places like a\nMTV News and having to block it as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nAre so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should wait it's one of these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this last week not only were they lost impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts\n[noise] part of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and the media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't doing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that the publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people laid off organizations were changed and or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook so to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think this this could be at\nAnd and they can do just jumped into both eat what is Facebook to under surfer so a whole lot it is obviously refuting the fraud claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that\nUm I mean obviously it took them accountability and twenty six team when these ... these kind of first uh emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matter is still pending in court and then everybody's going to have their day absolutely
