the world is one giant interconnected Claude of wonder [noise]\nSee if you can just open your science eyes when you look at a handful of soil suddenly you're going to see not just dirt but as seamless and central network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand than there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see it was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play\nAnd like a box full of different size balls there a lot of gas and pathways between those clumps that's where the microbes live and they use those gaps to full advantage turning the soil into both hyper complicated network of subway tunnels and the churning chemical reactor\nIt's this chemistry party in a sponge architecture that makes soil the foundation for all the rest of life around you\nSee those busy microbes metabolizing along and they're tunnels are what led soil filter rainwater keeping it clean for us to drink and the elements in

the microbes move nutrients around to underground roots living acorns turn into giant oaks and wheat seeds turned to the bridge for lunch it's not the microbes alone at work these Merkel and it's not the minerals enclaves by themselves that let acorns become oaks\nSoils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric was Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forms over to the living and back to the non living again\nThrough soils we can see how our bodies and our lives are also a tightly woven tapestry of living and non living world it's not just us over here in the world over there each

the sport are basically\nAll athletes that you were talking to\nYou or what it was oh after we think is important for Applebee's to use that platform in in the right way more than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of times the state and local elections that are\nSometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect you\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there\nNow you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer

completed the employee training but had been ski says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate

I Would uh share with you that I Believe consumers are very informed\nAnd if I look at the track record that we've demonstrated carbon emissions are down thirty percent and Duke Energy headed to forty percent and we believe that ongoing discussion with our customers on how to get there in a balanced way over a period of time it's something that we find our customers to be very interested in\nWhat is a balance swimming is a is that you're trying to find your way between a coal and natural gas from solar and all that does that mean\nYou know our goal is to increase the amount of renewables on our system never compromising so it's when it's solar it's battery technology it's natural gas Purdue gets also nuclear and for many companies around the U.S its nuclear\nThis industry has never been

making decisions today that'll be important and twenty twenty five and twenty thirty twenty thirty five so I Want to make sure that I've got a clear vision of where we're going to that as we invest
