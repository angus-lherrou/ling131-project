to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty candidates as well do you know yeah\nI mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks

are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women\nBut once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison\nSo far no more heavy steel doors\nFor the women that's not a sound me here\nBecause this prison is new and different inside the razor wire\nThis place cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates they\nSet out here from John and tell us depending on what level there and

point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insulin disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt and tie down and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had copies day I have one\nThe word and show dumb in two thousand sixteen our dates\nThat's really not a security issue maybe she added copies day I have one\nThat's the word and Sheryl dumb in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other presidents were three times more likely to get punished for the violation

property\nIt comes to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nIn their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome prison staff welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe Warren has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said is you know worried and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one at the Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six and not cause problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nFrom the prison the old mental health

more about ... role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about your prisoners relationship with them so long\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person uh since Trump took office\nTheir first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both and very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump\nTo go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first a cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he name check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide or this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of prisoners portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently as she talked about Christmas role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough on the air and it and I have no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former

on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above\nAll to now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House official who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent\nA but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance oh one of the criticisms of course there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security shame\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have\nA President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports that Kushner a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\nAnd you're
