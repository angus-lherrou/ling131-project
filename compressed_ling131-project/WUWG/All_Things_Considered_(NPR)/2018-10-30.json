Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with act CEOs Trump insisted he can change that you\nCan definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check forests can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states is that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as excited on this as well\n[noise] if President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would ...\nEr than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as excited on this as well\n[noise] if President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House has critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in honor of Halloween this week I'm bringing you Georgia ghost stories a union soldier and his southern belle who hangs for their forbidden love\nMichael into Catherine the ghosts of rise well I'll tell you that story at four thirty to\nSupport for deep ... comes from generous listeners like you and the dares bill tourism inviting the public to a dares will society hill historic ... home torn up ember thirty points including a first ever tour of Depression era gangster pretty boy Floyd birthplace weren't visited there is filled dot org\nAnd the Georgia brain and spinal injury trust on commission advising that a traumatic brain injury is one caused by an external physical force touches a car accident fault or sports the commission can help details a D.

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a boat or meeting organized by higher heights as a political action group focused on black women voters and Canada has\nMore than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country we ended up leaving the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense oh gee exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThat trust by the women's march I have is\nThis is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nI'm ... I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think\nA lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nIdea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those\nParty about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nAs you can see you later you have to turn away from family we show what is\nWhat is this is why why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nElection cycle no one wanted to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and they are black women ... we're stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue\nAnd what is actually missing urgency there's nothing on July ...\nWilliams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nAs in the middle of the day to leave leave offices Avon in life\nBut the suit\nYears\nEvery man and the whole law\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like ... all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem they take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down\nThey don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and some black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they are getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get\nAnd it gets tablets Schmidt isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWhat does seem to be seen to and is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls ... bears several organizations that are not a CBC on directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed\nThat she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nFor new congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with\nPressley herself but no major opposition in Massachusetts district practically is to become the first black woman to represent her state in Congress\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interests the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump

having me\nUse we turn now to Joan Donovan she said he's media manipulation at data and society of research Institute in New York City welcome thank you for having me here's somebody has been monitoring gap for a while now before it was taken down how do people on dad react to the synagogue shooting [noise]\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over a gab over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ... was actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gab CEO Andrew tour bus about powers posts when he said specifically the words I'm going in\nYou expect us to do with like that you just or anybody that are going in that what you're proposing here and here's the thing he answered the bad or each or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because\nBeach harbor you wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms gets filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these\nKinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this as heinous gab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app stores they've all cut ties with gap and yet\nGab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend how likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payment servicing\nAnd use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as\nSupporters of gap\nCount on it and is with data and society of research Institute in New York City thanks very much

Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nIs is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make ... look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of that Hey Ryan either\nFirst what has the special counsel's office that exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week\nIt involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part has not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting clocks\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she hadn't been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with Mueller in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting tiny hair\nTiming is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nUh but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nUh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a round the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer in ... in a a theory that has since been debunk some of the news organizations that covered it have actually were attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month he or she asked yet found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nYeah not regular regular peer young rocks or some had empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child on just said a boy is seven I guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the teen arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a teen pulled on protective suits and walked into the house\nThen just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the other way around the boy's father he rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nGoing on two separate monitor be you're going to be ... you hear the word ... you're trying not to look like you're rushing because ...\nThere are all great on crack who's from Vermont or be\nYour motor be now he fears the worst ... you're trying not to look like you're rushing because ... around the world you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first round because you know once that happens for everyone to start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive often time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly is because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with the international Crisis Group\nGlobal population is very distrustful of government\nEven though this part of the DR see how a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor may believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nHaven't seen anything from this government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not have the central government nor United Nations peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on Winona ... from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether the outbreak you've unreal you know whether they're true motives of the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city have been staging street protests during which people are sponsors are forced to hunker down\nThat includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored by Arthur is one of the officials tracking the epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go well but I don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operating zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the D. R. C.\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus on the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has just pieces on which has poured\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country as workers have managed to vaccinate around\nAnd that is just pieces on the chessboard\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country and workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect we have them using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak you know eat I'd ...
