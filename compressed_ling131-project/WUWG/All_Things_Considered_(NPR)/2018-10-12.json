Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like\nToday or you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged it in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled ... under washed them and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere is also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now just single

court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mayor and western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected the enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric Fethullah Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nTo us at the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup for sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nA lot of moving parts obvious later in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration\nBrunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that two steps districts that it was running and turkey\nAbsolutely then so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra donating the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table [noise] thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul [noise]\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nTo our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trial started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of more\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written but corn futures and fall and twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nAre mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a locally there was a second class\nYou got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a little ugly there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nSalt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices care is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWhich is the shipping costs were not acting alone on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a looming them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas\nIt will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminium suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices about companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs\nThat maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset just more expensive can\nBut they can't really do that right now the hills of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what tax\nBacking growing category alive many of the other categories and bad a lot of companies\nTracking category alive many of the other hand categories and bad a lot of companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for ... as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley set satisfying is not as satisfying as the\nBag of ...

week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player ...\nThat's right the athletic ran who that is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat with a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey how's it going good\nSo why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last\nFrom Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going to get ahead so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been like Twenty years since there last basketball she liked him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one player and a quarter\nAnd that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so that's ... that's a big part of the appeal\nBut it's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and then also\nI think a big thing for them as as a brand of as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being the global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him thinking like Nike and Adidas and they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James ... who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about sixty percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay I'm step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't into his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball ... business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's got a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever [laughter] and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said could see that in ... made a kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players ... off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of emergency and more on what these guys are doing away from the game and\nHere's component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing bits of highlights on scrimping like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge me as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts in a big part of their strategy with their news that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own

Vatican that posts\nSo it's all\nThings considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nMoral has been under tremendous pressure to resign as a report this summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nMoral was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so am I ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat colonel worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I Do not think\nThat the people have Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes or what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the last you change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charge too\nAnd they didn't tell me about how you think the last ... change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every\nSingle one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat whether it's completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grounds stale any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from\nBringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that when it actually increase the accountability internally at these institution where\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but\nThe me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings since\nThe Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro is\nOr ... institutions accountable and law

situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nThe week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed it for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members of other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing\nAnd a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself or with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing\nBased on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending\nThe right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending aware I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up just attacks\nAnd others drawing him I'm so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNon partisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime chairman power ceases those worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding as Donald tone the former vice

just\nYou know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes you know I I think the fears are and found it I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with ... in the next couple of weeks I think you know who knows but I Would think\nThere is there going back out and everybody's going to go out I feel better yeah for now I'm a David the president's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many appearances on the White House driveway yesterday said look the kind of economic fundamentals are strong we've got growth going on\nAnd yet on maybe

division between those advisors to the president and president south we're talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the president earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet as the guy that he picked 'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the present\nThose who advised hair Lee that point about uh the president Polk and Jay Powell in the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm going to do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked the ... never happened but but this is real now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since ... since he took over\nA but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm writing interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\nYou've now scene of a sizable downturn in the market this week and he's looking for an excuse someone to blame for that that seems entirely predictable unto itself as well he's somebody who does that often right so seeing the market ... points where ... percent whatever it is\nUh he's looking for somebody to blame this week I think it was\nTo power and we should point out here that the markets are back to where they were I don't even not all that long ago I should have looked out the number of where I came in here but this is normal and to be expected and arguably a healthy thing in any market rally\nIn just a time and time again it's your monitor here the doubts about the economy to come right out the downright markets go up and markets go down under the enemies he's he's showcase that time and time again that that ... unwillingness to engage with the fact that if it's going up up up up it's when I go down at some point\nWe talked me for a minute about um ... we're

off next week a relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player issue that's right the athletic ran who that is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat with the shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Fraser and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey how's it going good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she liked him\nSo they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed on\nYeah I mean it's been like Twenty years since there last\nBasketball she liked him\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they signed just one clear and been Carter\nAnd that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal but\nTapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they don't track people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about sixty percent of the league wearing their shoes last you know okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started to an end to park his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out man there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've got a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's made a kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that cola sign they have\nAnd they're really kind of emergency and more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing bits of highlights on it and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and they have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and that's a big part of their ... their news that\nThey don't want that will just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be used push for sure\nConnected Paula covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes so much Nick are they [noise]\nYou're listening to all things
