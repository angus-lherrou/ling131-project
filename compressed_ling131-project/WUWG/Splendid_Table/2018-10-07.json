be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eat when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by ... what's called the wet a southern\nAnd in this essay on this flu is positioned the culture of the American south and the culture the African American

who was interested in food and and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture\nAnd to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nUm but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and fell in love with her\nAnd it was many years later that I was working with a notice this editor Judith Jones who is the editor that also published\n... child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on ... road and and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously age of ... and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is or English writing I should say cookbook author and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about work it became apparent to me that her book that she did with missile Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American clean and culture and a very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up about ... to attention and pay attention moments in in Judith Jones as career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War has come to end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans house and then the perspective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really beautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of ... when she only direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat\nUm and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication what do you mean by ... ... when you were you say that came late [noise]\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community in a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of\nA full pros it's lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community in a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another\nBut if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day ... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity in a lot of ways that separate from what American culture\n[noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I I didn't pick up before\n... including my I think this idea of the face of country cooking as being a political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as oh just a sweet old lady yes\nA sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of black people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds\nWho ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave if they were fighting slaves at once that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you dimensional story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say\nHey whatever stereotypes you have of us\nIf you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine\nYour started at the wrong that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the lights of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures\nThat was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter\nIf this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it\nUm and and things that we think that's sort of still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms in the forest I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was you know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they created for themselves\nThey're ... they're literally making souffle is in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember\nA small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and there's this really incredible image of and they take the bladders out when they blow the butter up like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later like\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs\nAfter they've been slaughtered\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described in the hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man and a nearby community to hers who was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's real is [noise]\nUm and the reality of it I I Can't help but think put you know my son had those things in her mind certainly come on if you wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am alluding to what the sense that she was ... and her ... you know that that there was incredible Frank math and what's the present to do with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nAnd and that she was going to say it's sort of quietly and many people who knew her ... her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be said she said nothing at all\nIf he was gonna open her mouth or put pen to paper it was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from ... um and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can receive it\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you\nAnd then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can

grew up with such a particular version of southern cuisine in central Virginia and\nWe wanted to know more about that region for the call it on the corner historian Jessica Harris to fill us\nJessica results would love to be back for and I\nWant to start actually um by referencing a story which you probably know but [noise] there's a story where William Faulkner walk into the restaurant where an Lewis was the chef at the time in New York City caffeine Nicholson and he ate her chocolate souffle\nAnd then asked her if she learned to cook in\nAnd actually the sister roof told me no she learned to make the souffle from our mother [noise] so so speaking of the sudden his mother right here's this woman who was the daughter of an enslaved man who is making these exquisitely French souffle is\nHome to really let me think like can you tell us about the black food of central Virginia back then 'cause that's not I think what a lot of people expected\nVariety of things to remember I don't necessarily know what this ad most parents might have done but never forget that African Americans who were in service\nBut miss ed and his parents might have done but never forget that African Americans who were in service\nCooked and they cooked not only African American males what they called things that were eaten by the families for whom they were in or two of them they were in service\nThere for having a much wider culinary repertoire\nAsserted that Brett says cooking really mark this region or or get it\nIn a way I mean my mother's people are from Virginia I'm not the same part of Virginia I don't believe it's been said and I never really look that up I probably should\nBut one of the things that I Know about my grandmother is\nShe just cooked a wide range of things I mean she was a whole chief says if there is such a term you know she could roast anything brilliantly beautifully not what people think of normally she made preserves um when I looked at some of them is adding as early cookbooks\nAnd they would things it sounded like my grandmother's food but it also comes out of Virginia's culinary history\nWith Jefferson being this big Franco file and\nIs that what you mean well I mean I think that's certainly a part of it but if you think of you know the what are they called them in Virginia the S. S. would be the first family's Virginia [noise]\nYou know if you think of all of those folks of that kind of ... European of that desire to be Patricia in of all of those kinds of things that were in effect\nIt really would be in effect on both sides of the racial divide\nCue narrowly anyhow\nSo what are some of the differences in the southern food that tend to grow up with and what we I think more stereotypical you think of as being southern food [noise]\nWell I think they overlap I think the food didn't miss it and I grew up with because she lived in an agricultural seasonally inflicted universe\nWas very local very local we talk about the kind of cooking that she did which was very for one of a better term sophisticated [laughter]\nBut I mean sophisticated in its simplicity sophistication of Mr Ed in his food is that it's simple\nAnd simply beautifully done\nIt is about the manner in which is cooked it is about the ingredients it is about\nAnd simply beautifully done\nIt is about the manner in which is cooked it is about the ingredients it is about all of that\nNow that inflict in various different ways throughout the south I'll never forget speaking with Leah Chase in New Orleans and\nMrs chase simply said you know ... picky about what they put in their ... they are they're very very picky about what goes into the various dishes African Americans have not\nAlways had\nThe ability to be as picky picky about what goes into the pots\nAnd sometimes then that makes for a different kind of cooking to the degree that you have a choice to the degree that you have ability to the degree that you have\nVariations or things that you can grow raise all of that right best of the best is what you sir\nWhen those things go wrong when those things aren't quite as universal is one my hope\nWhen you get other kinds of food then you've got other kinds of cooking then you get that stuff that I call hardscrabble\nYou know my mother was Virginia My father was a country Georgia\nThat always played out at the dinner table my dad was the ... man but Colleen ... of all of those things my mother was the you know roast pork with crack lens and you know stuff like that so you get\nThe birds of prey but it's always the best of what you can serve slowly\nThank you so much for talking with us today Jessica always a pleasure thank you for having me [noise]\nThat was Jessica the Harris author of many but the latest poll I saw the back\nAnd fun fact about her a National Museum of African American history and culture\nActually called out to find the different regions of black cooking for their exhibit restaurant\nTony touching Martin is a hero and full disclosure she's an author I work with\nI knew that she was working on a massive project called ... it's a history of African American cooking through\nI knew that she was working on a massive project called the ... code is a history of African American cooking through\nResearch to two hundred years of black and\nThis picture of a cuisine that way more diverse and technical and sophisticated than the stereotypes watch\nWhen news she must have a story about Louis Pasteur joined us today\nTony happier\nHow old how did you meet as\nWell you know ours was a chance meeting many many years ago when I was a young journalist at the LA Times and I attended a conference that she was at and I'm embarrassed to say that I did not know who she was but um she was surrounded by adoring fans who did know\nMen so I went over to introduce myself to her and find out what it was that made her so special and it didn't take long for me to figure that out\nWell you know I have to say that my initial reaction was clearly one of her physical stature I'm sort of like going on that first blind date right you have\nTracks and and you you don't know anything about the person um but she was so incredibly beautiful and statue west and so poised intelligent and\nClear headed and not to say that other African American women aren't that it's just that that the impression that she leaves\nIt's amazing because somebody's will describe her as being legal\nAnd a half years later her middle name was in fact Regina right but it's like she was fated to that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "07"}
