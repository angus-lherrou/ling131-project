feasting and fast and\nLet's get the desert first\nWhen I was in ... school\nSixteen years ago I knew a woman named Stella\nShe was a pastry chef in the making and\nReally didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me\nMostly graduated not long after and we fell out of touch with\nHas become used to show what even more she'd done writing\nQuirky terrific blogs and eventually got more and more into writing about science and history of desserts getting inspired\nHow classic cookies and take some pies and putting were\nAnd then re imagined those recipes for the president\nIn just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook\nBraveheart debut on the New York times so\nHostile thanks so much for joining us\nI Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's iconic American desserts so what makes a desert iconic American\nWanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of this house not a lot of people are eating potato pie and as it that's not I\nGeneral and I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie and as it is not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know\nBorn and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that is so I didn't want to be a collection of regional desserts or deserts that were important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that connect us together coast to coast ...\nWere literally millions of women from to give her her daughter\nProducers so at least we're talking\nPolitically great have you here thank you for having a valley so I'm\nDying to hear the story about this pilgrimage in India but first I Want you to tell me a little bit about Caroline and that that area of India yes\nA ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd tell me about this pilgrimage what what are these women doing [noise]\nIt's a pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd simplifying and a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and the trains are filled\nWith women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad that it's filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ...\nAnd the entire ceremony\nRevolves around or adding to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up and what they're setting up our a makeshift horse of three breaks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're into how many women are you talking\nA makeshift horse of three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're going to how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nA year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to got us get rid of the way that they refer to her is\nTo call her mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this if this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as Broderick Holly and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\nSo set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift harvests with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously ... which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nOn the morning that this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice I'm\nA dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... um and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until\nThe signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple light the fire and that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there speakers set out women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so was actually really incredible about this is the smell\nYou're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut bark and these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment\n[laughter]\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us when it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water\nThey wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls [noise]\nAnd then they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... must boil over to satisfy the goddess so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy what's beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nUm they add all of these seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to add to key because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol um many women at gender there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and\nUh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf and they wait for a place to come around this can take hours and sort of in this interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap and then when the priest comes they all get behind\nAgain they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots\nThen they're free to eat and this moment it's so beautiful because it's something that have been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take a spoonful they taste each other's pong dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana leave back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise] mostly it's such a beautiful story thank you for coming in [noise] think he's highly [noise]\n\n\nWe pursue contributing\n\nLiterally\nParis so it's a

important food writer would never read to she was a fascinating person who led this very multifaceted life I'm washing what kind of person where she [laughter] yeah I suppose there is something a bit counterintuitive about making the claim that\nAn author most people have never heard of is one of the most important food writers at the last half century [noise] uh there were many incarnations of patients gray\nShe was born in West sorry in the south of England grew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics at a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage owned by her mother\nThrough to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and took up a career as a translator editor\nAnd writer eventually publishing her first ... Nineteen fifty seven\nAnd then in fact went on to be this the first woman is editor of the observer which was quite possibly the most important newspaper in London at that time all of this preceded our our Mediterranean odyssey which is really what she is she's known for everyone who knows\nPatients gray nose or throw money from a wheat so they think of this woman who live this very intrepid relegated to life in Greece and Italy and then finally\nYou need to think of this woman who live this very intrepid relegated to life in Greece and Italy and then finally in ... the very\nSouth of of Italy and this is a unquestionably one of the most fascinating chapters of her life but it it's by no means the whole person\nBut patients and from a weed occupy the sort of unusual place in the world food writing\nThe book as it was considered to be one of the best books on food ever written and yet patience remains almost completely unknown patients with a contemporary of Elizabeth David ... another British food writer and M. F. K. Fisher who have far greater notoriety and patients does and\nPatience wrote about\nFood and uh ideas into food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways it's surprising that she hasn't better known [noise] you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from a lead a change their life and and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nActually the whole cake can be made over a few days the cake can be made a couple of days in advance the Patriot cream can be made also in a couple of days in advance so he didn't want to put together this whole thing and one day that's fine\nBut after you put it together it really needs to refrigerate for at least three hours before you want a slice into it just has to set up\nOur recipe says twenty four hours in advance but I Will definitely a sit there for forty eight hours at least I think cakes like that that has some pastry cream and um\nThey're much better any kind of desert that's really has a custard and it's much better if you give it at least one day and the French love those recipes mhm Bridget thanks so much for explaining this one\nMy pleasure that I think\nWe're

should we talk about\nWell here's the problem but I I we live\nIn a very hot place or do we get a real like ... like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it is very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt no not so much because soul mates preservation but just to get the dry and a ... and so we\nReally are are very careful with uh we don't have a store things\nAnd one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece\nOf prosciutto a huge chunk like three pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of prosciutto was just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it come on a roll him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk [noise] and so in the midst of the party at my wife said well why should we had to wait to sit and just put it in the freezer for now and she put it in the freezer\nAnd it's been there and ah anyway\nWe have no idea what to do once we defrost it because we cannot possibly three pounds of prosciutto before it would spoil and I am totally committed\nTo your chair suggestions because this morning knowing I Would be speaking to my ... pulled it out of the free stress currently defrosting in a refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back there isn't it [laughter]\nYou know you've got the guardian not on the frozen for you know I see\nThis is an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I never actually had to deal too much with a giant fruit and block before that's\nThe thing you know in some ways a blessing problem and I have to tell you [noise] given the fact that he was frozen in our home freezer I don't know how well it's going to ... meaning if not learning and my my my questions to\nYeah you only give you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that can work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals I'm a pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're they're in the home freezer because\nCan work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're there and the home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that elite some juice\nAnd your main line that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to them as it was before the ...\nThat said if it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing is if you have a a\nDeli or if you have a deadly slice yourself or if you know a deli nearby may consider running over there and having them slice it thin wall it's still a partially frozen\nSlicing thin\nYou know package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nWas just looking solution because I thought the same thing probably was it was to even if it was it wouldn't be just said\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in some ways we're maybe your wrapping it around something maybe a wrapping it around this piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like silky thin sliced a state\nAssumed since sliced phase of it slices would be something\n[laughter]\nI Wonder even or even just putting the singing the slow cooker and sort of raising the\nYou know I have never done that but I\nThink right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey\nIt and I'm sure someone in Italy would like you know role in their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure\nHey try it and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know role in their grave when they heard someone done this to her shooting but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious because all the flavor is still there for sure [noise] the texture may not you know the flavor on a beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be white salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish 'em that of cooking the whole thing but or you ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it's air dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it and eat it than you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid 'em to use a I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\nYou know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it you know it's a flavor an answer for vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called potato and one of the things it's like a big giant stew\nAnd one of the things he said it was put a big piece of pork belly you know not like sliced bake a big square of it to them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish through the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so I kinda like that idea of like yeah different names you're cutting it in\nHalf and using some of it or chunks for added to the vegetable stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "14"}
