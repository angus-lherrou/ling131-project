winners have truly a child of wars and when we last left or her when they were telling us about first years of their seminal Eli restaurant cafe\nFrench food which we report in how they got into a figurative nicely with Susan would take a trip that would change both are going back to tape up security after\nAbout two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she can take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of\nLike a fake fight to a race thing we were racing to see who could bona leg of lamb quicker and that's how it's worked out well [laughter] yeah I think one she didn't win because well I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon in my finger\nSo I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go\nAnd so then there was me Jose Luis and we're getting everything for those two weeks ago she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nAnd she was gone how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did the core is like little ... freighters we did approve of pancake\nWe made doll and curry and did it shot navy and right and it was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian thing to do that and and I had\nSo inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting cuisine all vegetarian but it was the place where I I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab so I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were not allowed in the main little kitchen\nThey're basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath the but all the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different Brad than it was so\nInspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later Mary Sue took her first trap she didn't cut me right before she laugh\n[laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nLater Mary Sue took her first trap she didn't cut me right before the laugh [laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand\nAnd had a very similar experience\nYeah my uncle was there and he landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and they had a big very very authentic type buffet and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook\nFor the king and queen of Thailand for ten years before that and she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing\nAnd so then you know that our menu then became had cats to lay and then ... curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you\nKnow I'll do for a and so it was a very mixed like that and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then I you know we were we this is how Susan and I kind of worked together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let them go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think of let's just try with cream and parmesan and anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all of them [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other other is free she comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market I mean when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find anybody if we'd go to the market and see something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how to use it with this chili that I remember we discovered ...\nAnd but if we'd go to the market and see something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how do you use it with this chili that I ... I remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Chipotle he was more or less a chain of restaurants and it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nI mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher\nBut then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah\nAnd he said he came to work for his name was ... and we loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents\nIn their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around where we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu\nAnd literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new shows or what they are deep as we couldn't remember what they even were you know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nI keep thinking about the timeframe for ah this is in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and\nShift the restaurants and you know people starting today have such a different frame of reference them up and I think ... probably grew up with\nYou know their favorite Thai restaurant for the one to near with their family and their favorite Mexican place where they went through and all that for all that stuff is already built into so many American pilots are growing up though right\n[laughter] you know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was and food that was influence from cities all around the world we put a ton dory oven in\nAnd we got that ... from a owner of a Indian a hotel he was in India and then we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just ... that's been dry and its\nIn that we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just ... that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair and\nWe brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bomb so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our arm in there because you had to keep\nBrushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before our opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and walls\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of nine and you can't even looked like a dirty side\nOf any kind of out of the oven [laughter] well interestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right and we didn't know what that meant you know an opening it was just completely seat of the pants\nMay be many many more [noise]\nAnd it was great to talk with you\nThank you so much rain

through your stuff and you know they're thinking oh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winter to tell you the truth I'm you know for ... than it was something that uh we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um for Rick Bayliss it was also very different I was able to speak with him and his staff and\nTo really talk about it quite a lot of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list I pretty much knew that there were certain things that uh we stood out to\nUm ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he is an artist and these menu our forks of art and show both of course the menu items but also his women see as well as photographs in documents and a few kitchen tools [noise]\nFrom Rick bail us uh we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico in the Nineteen seventies they are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico and\nThe field notes are handwritten and then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type is notes halfway through the trip so we bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter it's well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook um his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance devices being Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see where really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise]\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with\nMary Sue militant and Susan vinegar about their you know their stuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and how they got to where they are\nWe don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and how they got to where they are how they got into the restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what would the challenges\nAnd how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have [laughter] so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes like be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the kind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise] um so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know if that's catnip going in and I'm looking at that\nAnd they had a pretty good sense of what we were after and had come up with some great materials or what is that what is it their donor your news from which is yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes arrived a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue ... knife bag um that she hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did and twenty eleven\nAnd you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged their six nine for the bachelor was chopsticks scissors investors all this stuff\nVery very cool I Wonder what Susan Susan ... [noise]\nYes well the two of them have also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful\nAnd they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and uh so we have um a nice gosh eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm [noise] and to come to the museum we will have a chef's coat um you know Mary Sue ensues and we're very into color very early on\n[noise] um [noise] and to come to the museum we will have a ... um you know Mary Sue ensues and we're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat I'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm which again shows how they're very\nCognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is wonderful [noise] um and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then there's paper and\nFor us there were these little notebooks that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at them and you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the corner he roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants\nSo little no books like that neither one from India and for Thailand sort of cool and you know this is where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurant in Los Angeles\nThere is so cool to 'cause I imagine\nYou know five or Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and like you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you send me the text text reader so then you're in the door to you [laughter] but let me a little deer when you're also doing though is you're going through\nEssentially somewhat which as you said someone's life story through", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "21"}
