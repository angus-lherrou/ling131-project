fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home [noise]\nI think so much for talking with us and thanks for having me so you have to tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came about\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally\nLeaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kinda snowballed into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the best ... vinegar I've ever had in my life so definitely a happy accident it it is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our son the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier is not justice overt thing that kind of punches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make of vinegar grad either two two one two or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um\nYou're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma individually gr by carrying it in that fat and that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process to use it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines uh it is a really interesting part of cooking because\nAs overt as we think it is is that is actually about ah the balance and harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned\nBaking recipes to react with a ... says well Oh absolutely\nThat science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish ... bread is a you know using that as a ...\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example the vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they're used\nTo go chronologically like the book\nStuck by different cuisines across the globe give us an example of vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they get [noise]\nI'm gonna go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar in them have some kind of the cities to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar and holidays and most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving Italy I just got back from a trip in meal you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now but the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball stomach vinegar which really wasn't export into the states if not worlds until like the Nineteen seventies\nA such a small amount is made that a lot of people have and you can experience that so seeing that vinegar and contacts and seeing that his barely used as an application where you heat it up to you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegars from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd makes these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nAnd this was another thing that I only really experienced you know ... or ms ... Khan writes vinegar the things you buy in supermarkets\nBut when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot at ... or ... for the first time\nA there is so much expression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor or depending on what kind of rice to use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional\nBasement or coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of race fingers in Japan but then there's ... to sue this red vinegar made from the age ... and it literally turns almost black Nikki wooden boxes before it's pressed\nUm then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's ...\nAnd it literally turns almost black you know the wooden boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but some of the elements maybe it's more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell vinegar is nothing more than four to six percent of the the acid and solution and that solution is water so kind of like wind there all these volatile s jerseys aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with to see the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before it's a flavor so you think that on your palette you you have that feeling of greatness of enlightening it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits and that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before and it is a carrier but\nVery excited to start testing that\nAnd there are a lot of these circular there's now out on the market you guys have done a test of the best ones right\nThat's right our teeth thing and testing team has dove into all of us are the leaders that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook and they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circulate her\nAnd it's small and it's weak and it is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful about how much is the jewel so the jewels around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm CB devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower now they're very light very easy very fast and they work very well they're also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred way which he pronounces her time starts circulating do it by coming down\nUp on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred and way way cheaper now too so it's a time starts circulating they're like so much for Natalie\nThanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen\nYou can find their supersede recipe for Mexican roast pork coach need appeal that splendid table dot org coming up I get to talk with you\nWe have a love story that evolved over oysters [noise] time\nFrancis lamp and this is the splendid table from ATM American public media explored\nGhost towns across the wild west these little towns and you can only use the imagination legends of Irish history who've been immortalized in so\nIf it was a great song or tune it was there before us and it will be there after us and investigate what happened to Michael Rockefeller in the wilds of New Guinea cannibalism is all about intimacy empower it's on the next travel\nJoined us for travel with Rick Steves this afternoon three on ... point find TPP Atlanta\nSupport for G.

challenged beautiful liquor that writer and I was so jealous that talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... the joke and then my\nBirthday this year he got me the Fraser ... they make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken like look right there I made some guys like oh God that's really all I Know how to do and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know I guess\nSo you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts arm praise or about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably either toilet fourteen inches pretty large\nOh big you know we got a big oh yeah oh cool and then you have some cats aren't cookouts which was like there was a little mini brings it was right and how big are those\nAre so similar in shape to her and I can okay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable\nI think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type ... because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal there so I I'm so don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and there were like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or two for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of blow heat in the oven just sort of gently bake there's just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation um bought\nYour twelve or fourteen inch praise or another they were talking because that is a really fun to be the appointment to have [laughter]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well [laughter] so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron\nIn general I think that kind of pot does really well [laughter] so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are like you say is\nA cast iron so holds heat really well and I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that\nIt can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you are raised chicken and you want to see the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil in there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lame and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it\nAnd the pan holds that heat so well and it it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short or you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a diverse such a crazy flame\nBut AOL just really get that the er nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I think that that piece of equipment that I thought he was stealing or breathing are no longer not smart things more my age\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark fear them what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you say this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just builds so much flavor\nAnd then you put it in there and put the lid on but in the oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking\nIt looks beautiful William pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a right and the ... because it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish [laughter] what a gift it also like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave me this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat\nCool rustic beautiful dish [laughter] what a gift it off of a good one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it\nToo [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us to\nTerrific well enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's now go was Louis you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her a\nHopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook those ... noodles like noodles they turnout machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say I'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is cut some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher heat because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still ... a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan than what's going to happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest as divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot but in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients so let us know what are
