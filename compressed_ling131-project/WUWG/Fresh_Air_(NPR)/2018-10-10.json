[noise]\nThey don't do anything [noise]\nSays oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would\n... first man [laughter] you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut and space\nThe space program in the sixties and Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien says al also wrote and directed not our land and whiplash\nCould you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control could you do any simulation exercises you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying\nWe tried to shoot it in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we we used full scale replicas of these capsules they were sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer on aids in crowded incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would amount that you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to uh and we would set those up against a giant ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nAnd you see the earth's spinning by over\nAnd over again you know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of stroke but you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire\nSort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real to shake and we'll be real\nWe'll post production effects to a to give that sense than than the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he's really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule at you know a several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know are we a ride and I both wanted to try to make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up our question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay what are we getting ... from where we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and er you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to rhyme that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience I've seen this is the noise [laughter] I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't and\nSaid can you tackle the bat that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nWell I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules war again these weren't the kind of clean or uh\nA ... position with ah just the crazy kind of noise making machinery that these capsules war again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\nYou know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe [noise]\nUm and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy [noise] um did get that actually happened yeah\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and uh was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nKaren Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um or that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI I actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there's\nBowls of all a bit um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically uh uh from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon\nWill know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong new at mass was writing has a ... [noise]\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nUh lived their lives sending seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves out or at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light Schwartz will review a new set of young minds recordings of ... sweet I'm Terry Gross and ... ah\nThe new by our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and his commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from tire Iraq with more than five hundred tire models from twenty to manufacturers\nAnd an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle meets budget and\nDirect dot com helping drivers find\nFrom TI eighty eight CIA is committed to helping those who are driven by purpose reached their definition of success [noise]\n'cause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon\nYou think about the American flag\nAnd I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie and then he's asked do you think that people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nThe controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nPretty much exclusively among people who haven't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused think uh uh obviously the wedding was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times though the flag standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe the the physical sticking of the rod into the into the litter soil and propping up at the flag\nOr we made a choice entirely in a steady choice not a political one to focus on Neal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes on the list\nTo a focus on Neal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down\nAnd then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone away from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those um those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process\nOf what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show and that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nYou're listening to your gp be an Eighteen station service of Georgia Public broadcasting energy being news dot org I'm drew Dawson GB Atlanta if licensed to Georgia State university the largest University in Georgia and one of the largest in the nation\nIn the market for a new car said the hassle of selling your old one and we'll take it up for free they'll support the great programs on eighty eight point five and get a tax deduction G.

that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's music he asked\nOn the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space finding my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon or things what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah\nSo it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody ... and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like\nIf I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pre ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your way to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so\nWas a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a ... mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal is with the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nIn space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no one in which controls certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving\nYeah Mitch control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm Bad actually found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nYou know why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nA a\n[noise]\n\n\nA\nLender absentee which Neil Armstrong played on later known entity is in the new movie first man which has directed by ... inches out lots of direct did la la land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you can really be gun shooting at\nYeah I I first met Ryan uh to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kinda languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a a you know [noise] I've been\nTrying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a three large stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim and sending\nA fell in love with it and and and winter Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way out of here\nAnd then a fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also here a year into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\n[noise] so I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules and space flight and creating like\n... and ... and then miniatures it's it's it's [noise]\nYou know raw land was a complex found but that's like the choreography in a camera work and that dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level [noise]\nYeah I mean uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a A N and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal is kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us a all through the making of it and and helping us get it right or but knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were\nAh going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see
