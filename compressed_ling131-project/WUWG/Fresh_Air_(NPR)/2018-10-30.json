sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders\nThat's understandable because it often for church but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of\nEspecially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a wins\nI ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um [noise] the treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness\nOr they would just wait and improve on me [laughter] so\nUm the group of skaters who you were\nFriends with us or aspire to be friends with what was that culture like\nAnd why skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits\nWhether inflicted from someone else or themselves\nWhy do you think it's an actual draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something punishing about that and self punishing about that\nAnd there's a great world ward that is true we earned even if it's just for you\nWhere are you willing to do that when you wanted to escape [noise]\nVery briefly at a time where

letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script [noise]\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was a single file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah\nLet's just say how to put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I've seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie [noise] and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten\nThat I think is a fire was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone because of nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dog\nSome are just so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer [noise] so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\n[noise] no excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay charges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but I Would make Marge Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLike Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but uh Lenny and Carl ... friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nI don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend to think about\nStory and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because [noise]\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine the on the corner and they're out another place or something [noise]\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie and it's the seminal\nMovie in my life came to the huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope\nAnd those are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my ...\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope\nAnd those are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it [noise]\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Marta film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it disturbs me and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the um [noise]\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid and what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\n[laughter] I guess just Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett

joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director and his directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties [noise]\nYou know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm\nComing to manhood on screen because she was started in your teens I'm super bad you are right in your early twenties Syria and and now like in the past ... Latino bunch of years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic rolls [noise]\nYou know in films like will for Wall Street and money ball [noise] how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making that transition to more dramatic lows [noise]\nJust by choices\nYou know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out I was like I Would love to work with you\nYou know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you [noise] and\nThey gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is\nWas a great experience with John ... told me [noise] and then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and\nHad talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir money ball\nThen in the interim\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then\nBite heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I and I knew I wanted that part really badly [noise]\nWhen I wanted to write and direct I think I had\nA lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow\nThings in my life are happening that are intense\nThan I Am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nI have to figure out what my voice is\nAs a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols are buried eleven center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers [noise]\nLooked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\nWhy don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese\nAnd written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes and eventually went to jail for\nFor fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's\nDoc schemes and eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he was approached by Donny Adolf played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene\nPeriods Brian ...

I see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to your show\nThere's so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people and\nThe characters in his films often do really ugly things\nYou still find humanity and the\nI like\nUnabashedly\nAn unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really\nSpeaks to me in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean we're kind of\nYou as a terrible father yet right wing it terrible father can be viewed but he also incidentally loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old his stepmother\nOf any hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six erode insult comic was all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop\nInappropriate inappropriate and NPR over the place Terry Gross [noise]\nMaybe get something I don't want to let me one of the [noise]\nOkay and you say I was shocked and delighted by the name check you on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like he like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that yes\nA little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like he like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that you have to listen to NPR it's incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first time this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key British au Seth Meyers was there\nAnd a bill Hader and told a story about a going to a Benny hard on his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter]\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if you will like an old Catskills comedian and then that for when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh you should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\n[noise] well ... thank you so much for coming on the show it's just been great to talk with you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "30"}
