Haskell welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter]\nSo did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nThroughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting because they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he says it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and ah she's in jail and she was a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you put your best face forward um you know as I get older sometimes I Would share stories with people in high school some watch\nAnd this is the story of his childhood [noise]\nSo your grandparents sound like they went very loving toward you but they they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\nAs my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me a ...\nThe the word tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nI'd come home from school\nAnd somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go and their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nI got to go back to school really care about [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cars but if you ever curse at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where he said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years he was also heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say\nWell at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smokers and\nAs you say to 'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her notes\nOh gosh ... we're so lucky the house didn't explode yeah still give your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and and I think a part of it was ah my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking it's taken a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young [noise]\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare this recurring\nDream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monstrous my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping and every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult\nDid the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and yes there are there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again [noise]\n... do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nHere grandparents later told you that that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to any one of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now in them open about that to help uh you know to stigmatize you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's weird for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\n[laughter] when you took our classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes 'cause he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected to teach you say\nThe best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book I was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned is\nJust add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned it's [noise]\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive woman slips this is how you have to draw muscles [laughter] this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comical classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally ... and ... in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nBoth thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really sent me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style of the nation develop that he did say that and did you learn anything nevertheless from the marvel comic books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um [noise]\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] don't ignore everything you're about\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with
