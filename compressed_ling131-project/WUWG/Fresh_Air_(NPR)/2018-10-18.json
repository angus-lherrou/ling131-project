confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to

a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote\nThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president nor his lawyers disputed any of the specifics and the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here get a sense of fringe from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak [noise]\nFor Trump was a remarkable

time he was in his mid forties she was really well\nIt should have twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties he was

and\nYeah I'd be things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and the\nFirst time to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs where they go look at what's been written about him before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling his story the famous line that he has always said is that it\nStarted with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest than if he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect bat narratives and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times on the road or a

A. dot com\n[noise] this is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about [noise] um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlayed that into his\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nUh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quick two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct will so we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is that in many cases these were loans that were never repaired with drought [noise] um\nWe were looking at one particular year was like every month is going back to the in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly from two to for Trump to get more money and we saw\nEspecially the the flow of loans increase those Donald Trump took on big new projects or\nYeah more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond\nYou know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo how did Donald Trump use the money\nThat was alone from his father\nHe use the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to bother these very crucial times for more support\nTo me get a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nCould also see that when he fell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nOnes picked just\nAlmost unbelievable moment in the story and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing a bad it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money and it's been raining a million dollars worth of food that can't read and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see and Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and knew well and it was ... to the will his taste\nHow's the lawyer one of his lawyers draft Carter soul to his father's will centrally and knew well\nAnd it was called a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's hosts in December Nineteen Ninety and for a Trump immediately sees this cortisol as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump\nImmediately says no you freaks out and he make the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family and what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out\nAnd Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years [noise]\n... what we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to gain complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe empire that for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that empire does um potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times

hundred progressive now that's progressive\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters says and Craig and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month about ... schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nTo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was a pro Trump very much wanted this empire\nTo stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meeting softer for a Trump died they would hand out checks you know Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale was developed for in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo that the the buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... trumpet still own at this time of his death I Hope that it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to their children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much his ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four or to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about died as we learned through the the the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nAll are and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars from what the banks which are you at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that Donald Trump may\nIt definitely wasn't that the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRA asked [noise]\nUm you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did\nPush back some and for especially on the low valuations they're placed on buildings made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked\nAn auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nTo avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns [noise]\nUm so then I'm going to ask\nYou to choose either the video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments and deals\nLive when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments and deals\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] part of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nSo what was your publishers are that come back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes this story of his sort of [noise]\nYou know pulling himself up or I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when they actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of\nA comeback I'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right is the sale had gone through the you know hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene [noise]\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried Trump belt and paid for [noise]\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making abilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward finesse\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of [noise] I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked [noise] and I think that we've reset that I think it's going to take time for this to to moving\nIt it over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset that I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America [noise]\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe what I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and\nThe Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves [noise] um but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nPeople for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\n[laughter] so you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room\nAnd the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access new or locked up in this room um cleaned it\nAllowed because you know [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter]\nIt but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um\nWith ah yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't go ... it'll claustrophobic here I'd imagine that people now are you were locked up in this room [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "18"}
