arts and crafts\nAnd Georgia's fiddler as convention October twelve to twenty it's more at Georgia mountain fairgrounds dot com\nThis is fresh air\nLet's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses [noise]\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students\nThe definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened to um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em\nAnd I even had students say to me you know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people all the way you a brass on people in speech and\nMake them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think is that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue that we do have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now [noise] Ah yes you know\nIn the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable intervening which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes etcetera and from\nLooking at this and researching it I\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you\nGot to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind [noise]\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways ... when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but\nAnd I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but\nI Do think that the question is not that big a deal I'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really\nA permission question\nI'm there really has to be an extra question [noise] he\nHe rented the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean [noise]\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that\nGirls don't always\nSaying no\nThey certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until the end up\nYou know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\n... understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out [noise]\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but\nWell awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like Iowa authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward and it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little ... okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance and may\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and dance with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said it okay if I put my arm around here and I said\nI Know his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nThat the first time that happens you\nSmell is definitely the first time in fact it up for it to me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I Know interested in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to how that happened and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know art in night clubs or ... dance parties a lot understand like this is my body I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... is author of

on campuses\nWhile it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is this empowering or is this ethnic rating 'em and\nYou know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self objective vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of way that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up in these\nKids that I interviewed in college just graduating now Brittany spears was like\nIt they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the ...\nThat I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears and it's like\nIf they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same ideas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a slug because this is the way people dress and now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts as of beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... ah you know it's it's crossing a line wave from scanty to something makes friendly sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised won't like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that\nBut they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves see reading your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom\nAn area where feminism has previously not been able to reach\nSo I just explain what you mean by that I think that is raising of demons that has been going on with me to era is living alone women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might call sexual assault or I might just called things I was extremely uncomfortable with and now going\nInto the future I Want to be treated differently in the bedroom I Want to be asked what I Want I Want to be able to say no tonight and how that actually be heard I think that behavior always kind of lives behind attitude shift or definitely and the other two shifts now\nBut I truly believe that that kind of most private act is beginning to shift\nBut never go Riyadh is thank you so much
