if you pay the money and everything so how did you find out what you could say\nI guess the fascinating thing first that was um was to try and show not just tell people that this was possible 'cause it feels if you know it's a it's theoretically allow me to have someone to say I just completely legal to do this it's kind of viscerally affecting when you have someone say\nGive me your money if you do you will get more money and written seriously give me your money\nAnd people sent in no tax ... it was a kind of showing that you could hack into the system\nAnd everything was allowed a so yeah people sent thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars to us\nWhy does that what it is it's obviously well that was a sketch 'cause\nIt's fun you know we we we we sent them back up things how or if they spent money we we sent them letters about the kind of lessons the weeping receiving from the pastor that we've been in contact with the previous six months\nI'm a ... you know I've outlined his hands and you could put your hand on his hand and pray with him that way so we had a I have an outline I Believe in my area and so that you could sit where I sat down together\nSo [laughter] we we were going to go into a correspondence with people that we eventually had to shut down because it would have become a job [noise]\nBut yeah that that the point of it was to show that the battery eventually to base is too low and when is this low you can have bad actors MTA\nSo that we become a church\nWe got to just register as a church I Believe we did it in\nTexas I Believe what did you deal with the money that we gave it to do it Without Borders and then people now you're going to do that no we could've kept it\nLooks like we just didn't want it so we gave it to a yeah to them because\nThey could do more than a than we could say what did you get in the mail in addition to money [noise]\nWe lost a lot of things that are probably can't say on NPR Terry so your listeners can only imagine a people sent us so much golf [laughter] there was lots of pictures of me and Rachel trench\nThere was a we have had a whole room a one point filled with the kind of Detroit's us of offerings but people are sent to the church it was an amazing thing to witness it was it was really felt when I was a kid\nWith the kind of Detroit is of offerings but people are sent to the church it was an amazing thing to witness it was it was really felt when I was a kid if you could send something to a show and then they would send you something back in the you could be involved in something was really\nFun for me so I'm like getting into a tangible relationships so that people could be actively involved in the joke that very involvement would help bolster our point it was a a really a fun thing to do [noise]\nI remember when I was growing up an oral Roberts was on TV and they have like a revival meeting and do you I was feeling like put your hands on the screen and he put his hands turn the camera\nCan ... it would be is if you could put your hand on his hand and you do something similar like that in an event that we just heard and so I think he's doing a tent revival and I'm like a Jewish kid growing up in an apartment building in Brooklyn and the whole thing just looks like so\nDifferent [laughter] the media so unlike anything in my neighborhood show\nI was watching it it getting glimpses of England was kind of this curiosity of wow look at face honestly it was just look at this level of enthusiasm and I don't come from a country that has a great deal of like a\nUm visible demonstration of feeling so watching someone really commit the Anglican Church in England is a very dial a monotone luck you mumble your prayers and then you return to the holes that you came out of [laughter]\nLowers the quintessentially American infused asthma face was already fascinating um\nBut but again the point wasn't so much that the point was mole the toxicity of seed fight because it preys upon people who cannot afford it but the idea that you want to just make a gamble or send money to pass that might be\nMy lupus will go away that doesn't feel but knowing to me but it is certainly a lesson said yes in my mind that when that directly\nTargeting their message of people that do not have money so they're saying oh you are you know your drowning in bills best thing to do and all those bills send me money money will come back to you so at that point your targeting the\nWeakest most vulnerable people people with escalating medical bills and and that feels profoundly wrong to me and so that outrage was what we were building\nFeels profoundly wrong to me\nAnd so that outrage was what we were building stupidity on top of\nMy guest is John Oliver he hosts the series
