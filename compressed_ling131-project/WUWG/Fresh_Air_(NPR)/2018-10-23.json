a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader in the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election in ...\nA leader in the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally and the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed the intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act that did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state of the federal court actually struck that\nLaw down earlier this year and said that there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voter so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas and over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary\nBy three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate an independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in coal box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas is voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nKris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen [noise] and\nNeeded because right now in his words illegals or being counted\nWhen it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation in an area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation than places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting than despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live\nWill get fewer political seats less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status is and that's going to affect the entire census and so\nIf a centrist is unfair consensus is inaccurate and so many things the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench\nYeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Terry twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiatives that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration\nThere are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting and places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest bow initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nAnd you have to wait five to seven years in Florida to appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million X\nA runner Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million ex felons can felt that the staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote and twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\n[noise] and Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent Don mouse and [noise]\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors in Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida are stored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he is emitted as felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\n[noise] still in the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as the Supreme Court as Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench with his position on voting\nAnd said have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court is Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what his position on voting rights [noise]\nShe has from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights he\nUpheld a voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but a cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud is that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf a kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal\n... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words or promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining a very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember in ... Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nLike chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote and the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nAmazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he\nLed efforts to weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to approve their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nBut at the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea that voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive and his words and in fact\nEverything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact\nThat there are so many new barriers to voting both in states that were covered\nBy the voting rights act to places like Texas and Georgia orange states that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread voting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fried how pervasive hazard than\nStudy shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare\nThat from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York what we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York state without a voter id law I Would have to find a voter\nI Would have to know what their addresses I Would have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already and\nI Would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we\nHave in place already deter people from doing it if you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number\nAlready deter people from doing it if you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data\nIs that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or say [noise]\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America is also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's been reporting extensively on the latest developments in voting issues will be right back\nThis is fresh air\n...\nTenure host of all things considered here on an eighty eight point five G.
