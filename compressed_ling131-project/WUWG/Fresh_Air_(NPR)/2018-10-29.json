Terry Gross\nAfter Robert Bauer shot and killed at least eleven congregants at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow\nToday we're going to talk about how Bowers views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement and about the threat that this movement poses I guess ... slow as a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter\nWho is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focuses on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Jared black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with fast slow this morning\nHe says low welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nThey're black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father done black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that do you find ... black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bowers\nThink you can draw a straight line from dawn views dawn work in this movement to the view the threats by the shooter I'm not straight line honestly starts with just the NCAA the shooters body attached to a fourteen eighty two white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know and and saying things like I'm here because of all white genocide and I can't stand by and watch and why people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on store front and nuts\nAnd and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was out to synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nThat gap is pretty small and in the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it he's he's one of the most popular people I'm gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and there's a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab you and I think the danger of a place like gab and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and powers when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[laughter] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nUm instilling front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son [noise]\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nSome really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many have you know several mass shootings\nThis reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on store fronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you know I have you spoken with either done or Garrett black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's heartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think that in the movement to them that somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nHe likes that slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will

be news dot org and stand with the facts\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Jared black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now and seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included Sasha so the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of tone it down to like that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like an audit or evidence from white nationalism is it that was his thing\nHere he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and the that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism [noise]\nReally did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything is going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nThe assumption was that everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so that gives them a language in a safe space\nOr they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the way things are cleansed word [noise] um\nRacial is racial out over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland sent white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\n[laughter] we're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black cloud rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and carry gross\nAnd this is fresh air\nThe ... who wrote a book about

immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section\nAnd quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors the day where the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture the Olympic ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white miss\nI'm a talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme that it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nThink it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and to different places like ... percent one percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there was a really\nGood example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to us who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\n[laughter]

nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you'd ... you'd been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views [noise]\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida there were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else who plays the magazine [laughter] you must have felt like Asian with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God it's dark black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who are Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had your ...\nSouth and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found that he really are um you have Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who didn't ... didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends\nSaid to you that made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stevens than and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think the very first smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and they went nationalism never came up well every ... other thing that we were possibly interested and did a and I think the math you said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually [noise]\nActually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nThe I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermine the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine old white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being a story of Dexter information I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nHow profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized\nTrying to affect you know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he had four and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who uh\nWho won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself can be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that their kids said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and those kind of case yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and it in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThat Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year":
