Gross the Supreme Court has changed during the Trump Administration the court now has to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and\nBrett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justice is my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and soap\nAre often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful that also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as pass justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court\nCongressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized he can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked\nIn the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist and as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you her questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nAnd it questions the credibility of the court because they might be very biased\nAnd it questions the credibility of the coin because they might be very biased\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there was no real solution I don't for example\nI think you will see recusal in such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ...\nPart of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself or hurt herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll cabin uh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's [laughter]\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece I think that in some respects a\nGet an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true part is and self\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence [noise]\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it are are there Republican interest or their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact\nBiased the appearance of by a bias is a real one having said all that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation other workplace 'em and say that\nA lot of cases in the area of of a sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nRuled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill and that story as a sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nTill it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life [noise]\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige I think it helps to a feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is because they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand sixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become um\nAnd Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony after Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice\nBut I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is mixed\nA ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court rules against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you can't have a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're out there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nComes first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and he said some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lactic cats and again this was before his nomination Mrs during the course that nomination why was he ... to lacked that\nOh the ... they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives want an instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measure\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I agree with it doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed\nWhite white for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do or the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst them not happen to think that cabin on the court will wind up being blessed she'll be arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave banned or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be are closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional is him his affection for the court and for its own reputation may\nLead payments on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show in the Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand I think Kavanaugh will\nOn occasion closer and then in that direction at for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Brock Obama and you know you can blame presidents for that or blame the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes tightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\n[laughter] do you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how\nMitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAnd and listen if the Democrats get control of Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes\nBrown or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require a constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court\nAs it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house and the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back the Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court over six four majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and\nHow old is your theater Ginsburg now\nHow old was a\nGung ho Stevens when he left [noise]\nNinety yet so I mean you can say for a really long time [noise] um so a lot of people or is it pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\nSo the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written um\nPower to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise] um so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment\nDo you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have [noise]\nOil would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I indoors I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make courage justices leave it would\nAllow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\n[noise] um I mean I think the most ...\nSince you have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\n[noise] um I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly who I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be um nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve and then you might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law\nNot personality not based on the political views of this or that justice but that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority system might look", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "31"}
