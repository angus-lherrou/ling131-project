the top college basketball programs talented athletes as young as twelve for targeted for manipulation by St agents ... describes as dealers in human athletic flash [noise]\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville is legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to talk about yesterday when the jury and the case was still deliberating\nBut my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money just college basketball generate\n... billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it directly to the universities into the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and where does the money go [noise]\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games are very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches and make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they are being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college Ken I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nOr their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen\nKind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business [noise]\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the

stand with the fact\nIs is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nAnd a lot of cases families will move or they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's when it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to [noise]\nDo you write that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid [noise]\nAssistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first to make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players if sometimes set in college basketball but you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but\nThe assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that\nMany of the head coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these assistant coaches jobs\nJust get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat\nIs extreme [laughter] so you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities\nAssistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there [noise]\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged\nWith taking bribes from these runners or go between ...\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[laughter] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have in some way or another I get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nFor an NBA player over the course of the ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary let adds up to a lot if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in Kansas\nKnow what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of future NBA player [noise]\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve\nProfessional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and an interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up with\nA with players\nMichael ... new book is the last

not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news that weren't people in the college basketball world\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news that war people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on [noise]\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces\nTo what many people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was\nThat the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time but that was a shock\n[noise] and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others [noise]\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball [noise]\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this has nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case said it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nDetermination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything [noise]\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean [noise]\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars and it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their\nTheir responsibility is to their teen first\nWhich takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week and you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree coming out with some injuries and\nYet the NC double a ... in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's\nThe athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\n[noise] want to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions\nDo you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nAdjusted in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful and you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity [noise]\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the Cairo the\nFormer Nike executive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone\nSo there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is\nThree shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know it\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean ... you said that that in some respects [noise] human apparel companies look pretty bad and is what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet there is a ... executive who is one of the three current defendants\nHis name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas James ghetto who this Adidas executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas\nAnd Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning
