saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here when I interviewed your father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that poem a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drop [noise] good for one more or less [noise]\nSo we're both rode a look and look at all we [noise] if you put on the uniform to fight for civil war or try to

to record the album he mentions you put him in a medical ... can you describe to say about that that you helped create for him\nMaybe the more interesting thing is certainly to me would be to to just say that\nWe were writing some kind of mysterious wind\nThe grace of the occasion there was an urgency to the entire mission and of course it had to do with a serious health issues he was a mobilized you had multiple compression fractures of his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nSomething about his work in general not just on the last to help them but in this book and in general the he she invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who is in my estimation become style jacks subjects because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate insane squares this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life [noise]\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook and trees and drawings and these are all collected in

past you miss collection of ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to resist booms think that in some way or another if we do to urge people to um to consult the work was smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... breed a stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to except [noise]\nI'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes [noise]\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend then quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion [noise]\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice is complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time [noise] and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than a you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to do to this is [noise]\nIs a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's ...\nAnd so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have to have his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd he and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in this room quietly reading his poems so I go and they want to get on record as say no\nAnd I'll go and step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to live and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nThe reading poetry that I'm\nFeels instructional or a has a kind of ... to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing through this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are in bed and every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice was that you've declined to read more post that your father I Wonder if I Am not being ... can tankers or intransigent\nIt don't I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading ... another problem with his\nFrom the envy that we recorded and two thousand sick the poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em poems and lyrics so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title

goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear about\nYou do you do need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what is the son and who's singing it\nUm but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and you must have been grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course her them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a forward looking out into the looking at it faces of audiences you know in in different times and places and um I was a deep\nAnd into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and\nThen you grow older and then you then you sort of see can't remember um [noise]\nI myself I\nWas making a record at the time and I grabbed it and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't ever stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said\nHere's scraps you record that's an amateur move [laughter] an amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel [noise]\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nWith love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he'd been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nUm five six but don't remember how much did you get to see a father after\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some uh was remarkable is remarkable to me um\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father would often even park a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise] oh yeah the like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things it\nPut it at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and he's just lived there my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of and how long that for [noise]\nFor he did that and variations of that trip my entire life and and\nAs I say the ... the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate dissuade which he [noise] contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was a feat\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it and its own way as maybe responsible for\nRevival of his career\nUm his reconnection to people [noise]\nUm I ... around the world and that that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um\nAnd like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry and incredible\nThey do with the canon of his work with his devotion to black and white pages and melody that did he\nI'm In ... incredible\nThe to the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself\nAnd um when you experience this this episode that you're referring to actually to compel him back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um [noise]\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this\nMost unexpected and [noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um [noise]\nThe amount of universities that suddenly started\nTeaching is works I'm studying is works or even [noise]\nThe whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being filled they'd never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for that economic crisis [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh
