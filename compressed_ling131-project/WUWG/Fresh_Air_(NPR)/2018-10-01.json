if I were robbed a bank that's fun to do it because they wouldn't have police said what did he looked like they say he had gray hair people see deer certain ages have gray hair so that's part of it and\nThen part of it is just general aching is but then part of it too is I feel like you know one of those young people took to the streets against gun violence I I was jealous of them but I just felt kind of happy for them you know that time in your life when you're when you're young\nLike that in and do you really believe that you can make a difference I I'm not saying that you can't make a difference when you're older that a person can't make a difference there was just the light coming from inside of them you know like they were like lanterns kind of glowing with\nThe there there are certain tea and you lose that as you get older\nAnd I had it when I was young so it's not like I I had a chance to have it and then I didn't that's when you're better when you think gosh darn it you

Academy of arts and letters metal for spoken language which is a pretty big deal\nAnd congratulations on that so much yeah so there's another section of the book I Want you to read and there's also has to do with your boyfriend hue and you're this essay opens with you both having dinner after having been together for I don't know\nYour boyfriend hue and you're\nThis essay opens with you both having dinner after having been together for about twenty two years or something you're eating dinner spaghetti and sausage that Hugh cooked and you've chosen this time to ask him how many men he slept with before becoming a couple of with you\n[noise] thirty five thirty six [laughter] every man ticked off on his fingers was someone I'd been compared to what one point or another not overtly he's anything but cruel but surely it happened [noise] someone kissed better than I did someone had more stamina a more seductive voice bigger muscles\n[laughter] I'm confident enough to compete against a dozen of his axis but he was moving on to the population of a small town thirty eight thirty nine\n[laughter] by what miracle had neither of us contracted aids how would we got no way [laughter] I don't just mean later when people knew to be safe the back in the days when I didn't have a name and no one understood how it's spread\nOne of the men he would live with a professor he had his first year of college had died of it in the late eighties and surely there were others on both my side and his yet for some reason we just skate had prospered even\nNow here we were the shadows lengthening our spaghetti growing cold as he hit the half hundred mark than lively sailed beyond it [noise] or [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nUm how are you at dealing with jealousy [noise]\nHow might dealing with jealousy I don't think I'm more jealous than the average person or that said I I Would rather than any other emotion I Would rather deal with any other one then jealousy\nBut that's a really great thing about whew [noise] is that she went and I both value fidelity equally\nUm it's important to both of us so we that's something we don't have to worry about like I've never had to be jealous of another issue with another guy I have never\nNever had to worry about that for he with me and it just takes a lot of your mind I think I mean you know every gay couple I Know has some kind of an arrangement you know like they're they can have sex with another person but\nThey both have to be in on it or they can have sex with other people when they're on vacation\nThey can have sex with another person but they both have to be in on it or they can have sex with other people when they're on vacation but they have to tell each other everything or they don't say that has to be complete secret and they don't [noise]\nAnd it don't seem so complicated to me like it's all I could do to just\nHave one boyfriend I I really can't could never imagine I don't know the energy it would take to have two or three at the same time [noise] um and I don't know I just I never I never wanted that do you think\nThat the AIDS epidemic figured it all into your [noise]\nYour interest in having a monogamous relationship [noise]\nNo I always wanted it but when aids came along it seem more important to me to not [noise] it seemed more important to me to find somebody who saw it the way that I did\nAnd and again I don't see anything wrong with people\nWhatever arrangement they want to to make for themselves I don't see anything wrong with that but I think the important thing is to find somebody because if you if you're with somebody and they say\nWell I think we should have sex with other people and you don't feel that way then it's really diminishing too you write to kind of go along with that when I'm not in your heart I think\nIt really chips away it was a person so I think the important things to find somebody who wants the same thing but I was like what Chris Rock said about um you know he's one of those people that you have to get um [noise] if you're going to quote him you have to quote him exactly or you're doing a disservice [noise]\nBut it was something along the lines of a man's fidelity is is that in direct correlation how many opportunities he has right if if people are throwing themselves that you it's a lot harder\nTo strength comes into into it right you have to be a strong person to resist them but if no one's throwing themselves that you then it's not that hard\nBut that's the thing you're the one who's out there and the relationship you're the one who's goes on tour who's on stage who signs of ... million books um every year and you know there's a lot of\nPeople who idolize you and others I Would guess that there's a lot of people who would love to have a relationship with you while you're passing through their town actually no [laughter]\nKnow one person and all the one person has as\nI Know one person and all the you know one person who has as of a proposition me one and maybe it's because I'm very public about\nBeing with you so so it's I I'm not a person who's out there and saying well words are are you know ... reading about being single and being on the hunt for people\nAnd Hugh is you know it's not my idea that he was handsome Hugh is just handsome everybody says she was handsome there's no not opinion it's it's just a fact right but he doesn't know what to say\nAnd and and that's what you want you want somebody who's handsome but doesn't know it [laughter] and then whew is just so Mm [noise]\nI don't know he's just a real standup person so I Know when people have thrown themselves at hue he just he just runs you\nAny runs you know\nBack to me uh [noise] and so I've been very fortunate that way\nBut we don't have to I mean sometimes in in a dream or have sex with somebody else and then even in my dream I think oh no I'm not going to have to tell you I Can't keep it a secret from them my relationships over and I'm asleep I Can't even cheat on you [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "01"}
