immigrants like me\nMom works odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother's a take

that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life\nThey were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who is being said that\nHe was being set up by two white\nLaid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nOr Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party [noise]\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week\nTo get two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for this man stuff\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people are now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together\nAnd for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch\nAnd she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin of a cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet

happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nShe didn't look like he had wanted to tell me the Bush I think she felt she had to tell me\nHow could I ask all these questions\nAbout a murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find
