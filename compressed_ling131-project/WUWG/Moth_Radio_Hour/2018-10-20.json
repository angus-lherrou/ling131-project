pure fantasy Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our centerpiece

watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swan when the tornado sirens went off\nAnd then came the rain\nAnd then hail and wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud\nSix months of making them every night and they were destroyed\nNo one saw any of it [laughter]\nI luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThat's the only time that's lucky by the way up\nWe had invited all of these circuits people but we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent\nSo what's

and so he said I'm not going to be there\nTo step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself but

to my wedding\nAnd that will always be true\nBut I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself [noise]\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big talk he looked at me and said your dad should have been here [noise]\nAnd he should have been [noise] and then maybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburger spiders just

jump around [noise]\nAnd\nAfter all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle police maps and specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nAnd the family that showed up for us [noise]\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either\nBecause I'm not married anymore and I don't think I'm perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even take can't fix\nIf I hadn't been so caught up in all of the

write spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trailer with my partner ... kids just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nPay death\nTo want to have a baby [noise]\nSilence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nBecause it's the stupidest idea you've ever had [noise]\nNow I don't want to have a baby [laughter]\nHis defense uh we had our hands full we were actually already Peron a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption\nAnd you're into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley and Riley had just become final [noise] they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nThe second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nUh this is in some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female I'm I was raised as a girl\nOr the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body [noise] um and as I got older um that's literal feeling feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive than painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and it was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive\nA and I could transition and I could be happy [laughter] um which is what I did\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine which just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and Beth is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise]\nAnd we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not gonna take\nUm but I live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise]\nUm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by ... nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really grow [noise]\n[noise] and I had\nRead all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like picking even buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nUm Hayley in Riley been toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those markers of femininity everything just gotten bigger everywhere\nAnd I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay and I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different\nI Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like best or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I body cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that I can do that their bodies camp which is to create life\nSo that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAround this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery instead of the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nTell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender a mess especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transit or women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready [laughter] um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say like go viral um but that is what happened to our story a basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone don't read that um [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nAnd just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that
