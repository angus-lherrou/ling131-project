responsible drinking [noise] and from the any each Casey foundation\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and I'll show today ideas about who we are what\nMakes us us and we've been talking to a biochemist Sam stern bird who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are\nYou're basically talking like super heroes write a perfect solution superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yoga I think that's the science fictional vision of what\nWe have long lists of gene dirty associated with certain traits\nI think that's that's the science\nFiction Association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have a long list of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory [noise] allow an individual to\nTheir genome [noise]\nWhy would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to paint or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see the divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many ...\nRewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nBest disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wanders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like greater profits that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be abandoned that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\nFor someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of cow sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual but that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's\nWhere I think you have this very ... issue of directing future evolution [noise] [noise] you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity more stronger muscles\nAnd maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show or asking a very important question is who are we\n... do you have the answer dino who we are\nAh I Know who I Am [laughter]\n[noise] who are we\nDo have the answer do you know who we are\nUh I Know who I Am\nA ... a A R including where we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University like books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo yeah what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell ... there are some intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking fat make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nTo locate just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates and\nAll of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker on the stage back in two thousand to this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century that meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian who they are ... you got man has no instinct and the anthropologist passed we want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J gold ...\nWhy should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost if I if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero five or something is written on the slate and people could have more\nThe others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical sphere of human nature\nOthers and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical fear of human nature is that if we were blind way we can perfect\nMankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them come down to two selfishness prejudice and violence [laughter] first of all there\nOf reasons to go to the human mind here's a blank slate and just come from a common saying as many people have told me over the
