just before the break we were hearing from architect the Sean check her party in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\nTechnology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention\nAnd we recreated our landscape around and the twenty first century technology can be part of the solution is it bends to the needs of the world\n[noise] and so what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the economists vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with ... and bicycle [noise]\nThat would enable us to design to main street the gang streets without Herb's maybe streets like the wouldn't walkways on fire island\n[noise] maybe we can design streets where's the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk [noise]\nRemember those big ladder fire trucks what if we can replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them when drones and robots that to the rescue people from burning buildings\nAnd if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity but now it like you to really\nImagine with me\nImagine if we can design the Hubbard craft wheelchair\nAn invention that would not only allow equal access [noise]\nWhat would enable us to build\nThe Italian hill town of the twenty first century\nI think you'd be amazed to know just a few of these inventions wrists\nItalian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know just a few of these adventures responsive\nTo human need would completely transformed the way we can build our city [noise]\nThing is right let's say we to transform cities into into the more humane places like with the help of technology or whatever I mean there will still be [noise] some level of inhumanity in them right in right not is it possible to have no social scored at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technologists in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us feel more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first twenty second century because technology has allowed us to change those standards [noise]\nUm but that's not the goal the goal is the standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction\nCities at their best our engines of social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening in three or square we saw what it was happening in Tunisia is because cities tend to be the platform for social change in ...\nAnd social friction requires a kind of what lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building public spaces [noise] subway system\nThe farmers' market places where people who are from different\nWalks of life\nMeat eyeball to eyeball\nAs social friction is fundamentally what advances

two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives new community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you just have\nWalked a mile new shoes during which time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets Richard Want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on July fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from a lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that said he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and but I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been in green to me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that in present an opportunity to worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of work\nHere's more from Richard bury on the stage because\nThere is a better way because\nBelieve there is a better way to get the money then panhandling on the corner\nI Believe there's a better way to help your brothers and sisters and need\nThat had a few dollars out the car window\nWe know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first\nBecause we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a neat [noise] but if you talk to panhandlers and many of them will tell you that your few dollars\nA full of dollars to someone that is neat but if you talk to panhandlers and many of them will tell you\nThey are a few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body\nThink oh towards feeding addiction because he's a beautiful place or a mile high the Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do\nAlways read the whole litter the pickup so if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask us all to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city\nThey have the answer is no would you please give me or mayors phone number because I Need some advice [noise]\nBut the second question you have to ask is this are you supposed to panhandling working if you're taking a punitive approach honest ingest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting\nTo the root of the problem in your city\nSo if you have something to do most people that have something to do it again it is it's not that complicated [noise]\nThe silk so would you do we took an old van ... motor pool a old dodge van but some tires on it mentioned the brakes worked and uh then we reached out\nTo St Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we ask for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to employment programs", "year":
