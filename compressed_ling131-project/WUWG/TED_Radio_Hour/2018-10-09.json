responsible drinking and from the any each take the foundation\nIt's the talk radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and I'll show today ideas about who we are what makes us\nAnd we've been talking to a biochemist Sam stern bird who's been explaining how new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are\nTurned bird who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create human and so you are you're basically talking like superheroes right like perfectly Asian superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I think that's that's the science\nFiction Association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory [noise] allow an individual to\nTheir genome\nWhy would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still in here for the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nSo do you consider that a an enhanced\nLike it's like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see the divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nBest disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species fighting\nBut I mean I mean part of me wonders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like greater profits that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and he was completely be abandoned that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of cow sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution\n[noise] you know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack creation gene editing and think about power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com [noise]\nThe creation gene editing and the unthinkable power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nToday show we're asking a very important question is who are we\nDo have the answer do you know who we are uh\nI Know who I Am a ...\nA year I ever had a clear where we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo yeah what what is it that make us who we are\nYeah well ... there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates and\nAll of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat with Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand to this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century that meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist passed we want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nA scientist Stephen J go without\nWhy should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial\nMost is that if we're blaming slaves and by definition we are\nAnd appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial for most is that if we're blaming swayed by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero but if something is written on the slate and some people could have more\nOthers and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical sphere of human nature is that ah if we were blind way we can perfect\nMankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instinct perhaps some of them like Dana to selfishness prejudice and violence [noise] first of all there are\nOf reasons to go for the human mind here's the blank slate just
