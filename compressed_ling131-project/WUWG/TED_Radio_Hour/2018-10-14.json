serve non human animals like eight years even wise\nLike to have you look at this pen so it's a it's a legal thing [noise] it's our book she might have or the cars you own they're all legal things the right age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes\nThat legal things from [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing [noise] and like a a legal person\nWell since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut a person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons [noise]\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now dumped all human beings are considered to be ...\nIs not legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal person they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\n[noise] or even why these ...\nCourt has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia\nIs a person who has real legal rights [noise] even live in these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals or\nBecause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer ... ... ...\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair ... and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because at one that's for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer had my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that\nAll of my clients all the animals there's interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible there was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal per se is now at that time\nAbout her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human out when I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ...\nChanged the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties what's even allies was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy\nThat's an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia about Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape [noise]\nOf the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because to an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so\nIn the fall of Seventeen Seventy one change Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight and enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London\nSigned him bring him to a shift and marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were Jan's was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord man skilled who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law ... corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I have to pay this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the detain are required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a British ... corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person that he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious [noise] that's a common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves had walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your team summers of course a non human version of James Harrison\nStarted to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord\nYou like you needed to find your game summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and [noise]\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield still how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and we filed a hundred and sixty pages have half a day that we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and\n\nWriter and legal scholar Ender's Walker and our
