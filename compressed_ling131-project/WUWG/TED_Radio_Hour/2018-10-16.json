was what was the idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on member legal system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense clinic at NYU and step into Manhattan criminal court and never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg\nI saw so shocked me that\nThis can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this asked his project to [noise] um\nAnd I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career and\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what would you\nBegin to realize very very early on at the public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local court is deeply deeply defined by climbing by race\nAnd so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could but definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise]\nHere's more from Robin divergent on the stage you know\nGreat

means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes Steven wise\n[noise] like that you look at this and so it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing at several books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal things the right age that you'll see behind that they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing [noise] and like a legal person\nSince Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut a person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons\n... slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now the ... all human beings are considered to be ... [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so can you explain how that works\nSo a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia as a person who has real legal rights\n[noise] ... even live in these recent changes as evidence that or broadening the definition of legal person\nLegal rights [noise] even why these changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals or to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer ... [noise] [noise]\nNow my red Peter Singer spoken Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer\nHad my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal per se is now at that time\nAbout her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially\nChanged the designation of nonhuman animal some illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and a man Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first lawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much\nTo be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties what's even allies with chefs beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa have survived the middle passage\nYears ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter I got there James decided he was going to escape [noise]\nOf the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because to an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so\nIn the fall of Seventeen Seventy one change Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight and enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London\nFind him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were Jan's was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is gone parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law ... corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd he said this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person that he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to ship\nThere were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so ... that's a common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal\nTrans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever and common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James ... of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find who James how much that we began with those\nJames numbers and [noise] I started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield still how did you find her James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun\nSuing on behalf of so far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention to court to make it clear that they are autonomous bangs that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and we filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that can we say altogether\nIt shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous being to being slaves\n[noise]\nYou know selling a car can be a hassle but ... is a whole different story split I was
