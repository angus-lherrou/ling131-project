live in New Jersey\nI remember\nFemale I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and I mean you saw it live young folks are call you when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like\nKind of uncomfortable right because you you were talking about how you shake like she cure and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially when I\nDo naturally because I've made a stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable\nWith me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact that I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on\nWith me because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that this really has made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing as someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah on a shamed am talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nOh I see people with the pain don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't life on his mind travel wise you can do it yes you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters warm up and I was often if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went through the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aid we all got my mother flipper [noise]\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by ...\nIn August eighth we all got my mother slipper [noise]\nMy father taught me how well off when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking [laughter] I Know they tactic that he used this he wouldn't dangle a dollar bill in front of me have my inner server was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been sworn to any time [noise]\n[noise]\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right now I was able to walk a fine but I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\n[noise]\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [noise] [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nRealize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard Pryor he know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an author and still guy on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his daring\n[laughter] you know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their ... their challenges to humor right and do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean deep\nThat that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons writer or their challenges their humor right and do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started\nPost nine eleven in New York City I might find than I founded the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and\nWe always made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say\nI'm

country doing what\nThey call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patience [laughter]\nYeah I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nThat trip and again took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came out something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nGroup spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I

macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about my lungs so myself comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign to\nRaise money work we have for over five months got approved and today\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to back the poster citing political content which they got a couple of those posters he was one of the Muslim\nMuslims or what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe\nAre considered political by the MTA\nOf Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign\nBasically what I'm saying it was a couple of dark comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWeird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like all\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but it\nJust changed all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\nYou talk a lot about using comedy cool and there's a great moment of the film I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called name that

totally book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death or because\nOf her on it is the\nMan people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was a violent um came from the Koran Mary said\nWhen no man has touched me\nTo do we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff in them so why would we hold Islam to evaporate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you know a lot of resentment of three of them do\nDuring a\nThat means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love in return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing a little performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found [noise] the way I like to look at it as you get one person to live in a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifting perception\nIs social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these\n\nMedia and the games first

funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the

that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nAt least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I
