as a shooter have recanted and\nWe'll know DNA linking him to the crime they never even found a weapon so no physical evidence no DNA and the eyewitnesses have recanted I Know I've read about this

long time I know it all started over Twenty years ago I'm aware multiple hearings and every time they've known Troy Davis guilty why do you think that is\nBecause the legal system is racist try doing\nFine you want to get technical\nThe first case in Nineteen Ninety One found him guilty\nThe burden of proof required to prove yourself innocent after a guilty verdict is extraordinary that burden of proof is a weak spot and the law is that what they told you\nBut they're not the only ones saying gee su law review the AJC people are really talking about it ironically that burden of proof was put into law by Bill Clinton to try to expedite terrorism trial\nWhich disturbs me because I Know I Love the Clinton the burden of proof is ridiculously unfair [noise]\nWhat is the middle of the

without having any law background a real knowledge about the case I Know that seven out of nine witnesses recanted or did you read that\nIn the trial transcripts no I read it and the New York times and and the packet amnesty gave me we live in the age of the soundbite Allison people are on the edge of their seats every day just waiting to be outraged about something\nAnd something like this comes up and they are outraged to what I understand that I have to tell you that there's a reason to legal system exist there's a need to protect the accused from the outrage of the mob there has to
