people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love in return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nVery publicly Muslims thing a little performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found [noise] the way I like to look at it as you get one person to live in a couple of people

that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that might\nOtherwise be too uncomfortable unhappy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nAt least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an indication\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I
