P. P. Atlanta\nIn Ireland they say you'll never forget someone\nThe Irish remember the events and the pizza shape their history and the many traditional songs written over the lyrical look at some of the heroes of Ireland\nSummary on some legendary we're joined now by singer copyright\nCat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of public ... with us right now and travel with Rick Steves to introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remember and it's all\nIt is great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of lights in the context of Ireland music ties in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yeah Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl just swept away by it\nIn with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes a Motown music coming out at a Detroit girl just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer so\nMy father was a singer it came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician a harsh so she always had music on the\nStereo playing popping down member vinyl one after the other blow down and also we were members of the game the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit and that was our community that was where we socialized and so I sang my first song into a Mike there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's got a very very strong Irish population\nHad a bit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely\nAnd then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off everything was generated by us and it was all song in story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher I agree\nA lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it things to something larger disparage\nIt boy the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is the way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island does a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus throw me off the bus but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs their songs about greed horses there are songs about people's families there are songs about death in communities drownings off the coasts of ... that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nHeartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began to be a relationship with England and just tough times\nSo everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nAnd heartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began of your relationship with England and it's just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how everyone's going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who aside or you want do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising well yes big deal it was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that ... you're Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who were actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote these songs and I'd like to sing one for you know if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by ... Patrick Henry pears that's one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people Greece O'Malley who was the pirate queen environment born and Fifteen thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first thing she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnocked people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own heroes so\nShade or did they all girl who they need to you\nKnow it's a you\nKnow she had a real shame how are ya oh shit\nThat's just\nOne verse so the Irish are going to save themselves [noise] yes and they're going to do it became Gaelic\nYes it's going to be the gale is not the French or the stash and it's going to be ... and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home if you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring with the planting of that the tea says in the last of the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week\nThe rising for them in spring with the planting of that seat he says in the last verse of the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week after this but in summer will be the bloom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the the ... the Ira spreading out how many hours tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland but yeah that was actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely this is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America by Ayman devil there to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of the musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant fiddle player changed the way Irish people play the fiddle\nHis label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland\nIs travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy right she's been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years before Rand ensembles like cherish the ladies and she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist of a decade to\nThat was born in Detroit now she calls Ireland's county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums and her performance schedule our on our website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nAnd when we think about Ireland it's also a proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to\nBe independent and I understand that the first the printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for everyone to\nIt's a ballot history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most accepted it was Thomas Davis who is one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger\nThomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh it's between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of a country with through its ballot tree and I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are ... they still exist were still singing them\nThey keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody\nSchools are ... they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that's sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after us so we're just playing our part in continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear or a street musicians and your music in the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner they'll they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yeah there's been a word and the thought that you've got poets who would put their poetry to music something audience don't realize there's an extra dimension was a great Irish poet that might have been caught up in the music\nTo just wait wait

New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a tube dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top and with a Dutch miner or thirty four year old Anthony ... just named Renee ... Singh and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were a\nLot of people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and uh\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an circle part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nAnd you know you could be very well teams sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into society\nYou ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a culture point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society where one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this is a man from who represents soon the most powerful family and the most powerful country in the world and then as mad at a crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nIn the head hunting and you know when the as men men who killed them so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back\nThat had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise] and they consume them and there's no more [noise]\nArticulate display of of power than that so\nDid they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nNo they didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them\nI mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify as men in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed\nA local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village a lesson as he wrote in his report since he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with and then he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know traditional place the place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was around I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the man's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned out so he\nGave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world painted\nHofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report today on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he just\nStumbling into their world Pete did\nHofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report\nToday on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the rocket has he investigated his disappearance and deadly clash\nBetween cultures in the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage ...
