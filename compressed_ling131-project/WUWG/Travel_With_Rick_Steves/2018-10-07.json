website\nAmerican and Japanese culture all her life and is the author of the guys\nLiving abroad Japan Ruthie also hosts tours of Hokkaido website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace [noise] hop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that while you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life\nIt's almost just part of the culture so for example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated\nAnd most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nOr is she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life\nAnd so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be ... though it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just setting up the numbers here you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it in or sent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred or so but it right Kate because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionary such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody accept Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do with us from northern got to be for me are are the sort of the right exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would tax write they would take on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what his Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way up the gods it's a type of ... or the ...\nKennedy in Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she told me the way up the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock and the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings too that God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images and she do like statues are idols or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese islands\nThe emperor God do you mean the the amber who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state Senate people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and miss that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals that sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or rice planting festivals that are related to do so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk and then on New Years\nIt was like a whole time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this song what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of things that you may have committed to temple bell very slowly hundred and eight times [noise] and then as soon as Newton I passed on New Year's morning\nPeople flock to the sheep they'll shrine to pray for health\nAnd success and happy new year and by\nA flock to the Shinto shrine to pray for\nHealth success and happy new year and by hand Neal is\nEven something to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the sheep they'll try so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you can make your book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan\nAnd really the one we're thinking about living in Japan wants the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on a hand in the domestic world these days are just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career\nThan there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes and they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so there isn't any changing\nYes so the younger generation is says pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to call them on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of new service or go overseas\nNumber's eight seven
