Australia's busiest actors\nRight now she's starting at three newly released TV drama series\nShe plays the title role of the high powered attorney and two seasons of Janet came and she has a leading role and the jak Irish detective shows\nStarring in the lavish drama series place to call home is what building her international following\nThe series is set in rural Australia in\nThe volatile postwar Nineteen fifties\nThe episodes explore the air is evolving issues of national identity and prejudice\nMartin's character nurse Sarah Adams returned\nThe episodes explore the air is evolving issues of national identity and prejudice\nMartin's character nurse Sarah Adams returns home to Australia from Europe after surviving the horrors of a Nazi prison camp\nWe caught up with Martin between filming dates at the ABC Studios in Sydney to find out\nMore about her role in a place to go home and also what she enjoys most about Australia today [noise] hard\nCome to travel with Rick Steves thanks for having me\nWell congratulations on your success I understand a place to call home is a huge hit in Australia and now it's getting more and more airtime on public television in the United states\nTo lately it's got a huge fan base agrarian America there's all sorts of\nFacebook pages and Twitter and ... and um the fans have had a huge influence actually making they should continue certainly in this country but I found out yesterday it's sold to a hundred and twenty countries around the world\nA place to call home and it it really gives us a look at at Nineteen fifties Australia you know we've in the United states we're coming up this frenzy about Downton Abbey which takes us intimately into this fascinating world of English aristocracy a century ago\nYears series takes us to Australia and the and the age we think of as Eisenhower and leave it to beaver and sort of uh that we have enough to object simplistic looks at the Nineteen fifties but sort of peeling back the layers to tell us about Australia in the Nineteen fifties\nIt was posed tools for us that's how we define it so there was a depression um people who are returning or not so there was a lot of lost a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche eats\nA lot of them in a disappeared and said that women had sort of taken ... found a better place for themselves in society and community in the workplace\nAnd it was a time of reconnecting to cultural identity I suppose there wasn't a lot of frivolous he and a celebration necessarily even though it was seeming success um because the last ... with a great\nSo the show starts with a woman returning from ... to their Adams having being away from home for a long time and she had fought in the wall and being a Holocaust survivor and that's all explained in the show as to how that could possibly happen to her\nAnd she mates this very well to do family on the ship on the way back in accidently fools madly in love with the\nHow that could possibly happen to her and she mates this very well to do family on the ship on the way back\nAnd accidently fools madly in love with the um the son who\nWho are of course it's not the right match and should never bay and saw a war begins outside the war between this family and this woman\nIt's really a look at where we've Bain and how far we've come about what I Love about the show and better late to create what he's done he's said as a melodrama and he talks about um\nThe ... films so he's referencing a particular genre and so it's quite high and but it's it's about a deep underlying\nUm prejudice and racism and it'd be a and I'm sensitive to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a straight and television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and look at it and how how was dealt with in that time and then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute or two about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected and at the same time expect more\nIn the same time I had that sense when I saw you even when you were sailing from Britain back to Australia for the war in in a place to go home and the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell Australia had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had been that way I feel very very long time and as I say to the men left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about Sarah she comes way they'll say Europe and surviving a Robin ... was she was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... in London and he's a woman who\nWho really doesn't need to be the center of attention and yet her actions keep putting her in the spotlight because\nShe's selfless but she she marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing that to an ruffling all the fed is of course which are in the hats these amazing costumes and the Nineteen fifties and there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very depressing but actually there's a lot of ...\nThe fed is of course which are in the hat ... amazing costumes in the Nineteen fifties and there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very depressing but actually there's a lot of joy in watching that happen as someone breaks down in the wool ... reign\nAt a time when you come up with ... or send a text you have to arrive and actually have a conversation which usually means a cup of tea and some and biscuits which one of our nation's greatest biscuits um\nMade from the ... of them I send maple syrup back in the day so I mean certainly when I shoot it\nI can smell my grandmother and I can hear a voice than I can either radio and I remember the leftover of that time the kind of lost that dates of that\nAnd certainly it talks to a lot of historians 'em and internationally as well that'd be like Downton Abbey\nBecause it is it's a full absorption in another place and it's like a different world um it's like traveling when I traveled to Japan and I go this is like being on another planet I Love it so much because it's so different and so completely although and that's what they should really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and the list is lea filmed and and wonderful acting I Do think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just ... about the fifties or does it a challenge them to see where they are today and and and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together\nAnd that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire then sitting around the radio than sitting around the television has been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together\nBecause everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's there's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognize for everyone\nWhat a delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because this can\nVerbalize or or or help them visualize this reality and it also artfully deals with a lot of the dark side of a sort of a sweet superficial world\nThat really need to be dealt with thoughtfully absolutely have to say that this travel with Rick Steves we're talking with mark ... she plays share Adams in a place to go home begin

you're you're clicking reminisce about my trip from last January in two thousand that's all I came over for the New Year's eve fireworks state for a glorious ...\nDid not want to come home and I do to bridge fine style\nTell us about this bridge and without being too obvious New Year's Eve in Sydney, Australia is the middle of the summer so it's nice not and everybody's out on the beach climbing over the bridge what's it like Erica\nI'm less strenuous than I lurched fearing it takes rarely three and a half hours from start to finish extremely well organized\nOn how the group of more than fourteen and um they pick you up I think it's every half hour or hour you go along with a certain way here to our guy will stop you explain what you're looking at some point give you some history of the city and at the bridge\nAll on another little bit south again\nAnd they take your photo at various points and um\nAre you actually really are you roped up yes\nOh yes you are saying Hogan is like a beer but up to one of those uh cable ways where you've got the Caribbean ... and you got two of 'em and you go from linked to link is that right\nAnd when you get to the top they will take your photo and then the other side of the bridge and we'll come back down while the other side so yeah so I don't know anything about\nAnd it took about three and a half hours and you do with a guide small group and if you pass out you can't get hurt because you're harnessed and your your hitched to that cable right so you just\nAnd you do with a guide and small group and if you pass out you can't get hurt because you're harnessed and your your hitched to that cable right because you're just like a second potatoes dangling from the cable and your guide within slide you to the end of the\nReally sad because I asked them about their liability insurance and they said they sit in an ...\nYeah well now you go to that that if if you've got to guide they make sure you're harnesses on writing you you have to care of billionaires and some metal cable so there's still probably ah one of the great thrills you could possibly have passed a tourist and that's a good thing to check out while you're in the\nThey also do a breath test just so you know [laughter]\n[laughter] well [laughter] I think\nFor everyone else that would be good but now he's only they don't want no one's been drinking or feeling like they might you know how you can have anything in your pocket isn't that right Eric I just in case they fall off the bridge onto the tropic below\nThat crack there are only five items people take I can only do it three of them are and like if you're an asthmatic like your guy will take your spray and their little fanny pack\nSo what's the name of the bridge again I've got a check this out more what is the bridge the Sydney how the brain to Sydney harbor bridge Erica while you were there did you enjoy Australia Day we happen to be there for them\nAnd that was my question I had an opportunity to possibly go kill a number and for the open a January and wouldn't be there over Australia Day want it now that there's a traditionally to celebrate or rational\nThis didn't Lee is is always an indigenous or many which is called survival day\nAnd uh usually this great speeches wonderful traditional music food and celebration set up seeing any safety and certainly in Melbourne that'll be happening probably in ... square it's cold which is very close to the astray and I've been stadium taking idea\nIs that on the same day every year yes it is the twenty six January January twenty\nSix Erika are you a fan of uh a place to go home has been watching the series\nI got it subscription to acorn t._v. ... so I could watch that show\nAnd and what do you like it out I mean it it sounds like it's an addictive show or what do you enjoy about it\nI Love period pieces for now and I'm as mentioned earlier just the performances and they and they do have our topics that you wouldn't necessarily think they would cover straight after that so that lasts\nSaid earlier just performances and they and they do have our topics that you wouldn't necessarily think they would Congress that so now that love triangle and uh [noise] I'm a social mores at the time that you reflecting on how far we may or may not have contact\nWith Andy just great haircut thanks so much for your call All right thank you okay and the other day I drank 'cause they're rushing yeah\nThis is travel with Rick Steves who've been talking with mark a death of dark and uh she's the lead role the ... Sarah Adam in a place to go home and ... you know we're all thinking about sitting here\nBut if you want to take a little break from Sydney or what's your favorite place to travel in Australia and why\nMy favorite place to Tasmania um it's a tiny little island on the bottom of a strike\nDown the bottom of the right hand side and my husband's from this so I'm I've been going now with the ... the last thing is it's still going to the old sandstone building from the conduct days\nIt's I'm not very far you can drive forty minutes at the my tenure in my incredible\nSeaside town of seeking it and Franklin historically they're incredibly rich they've got a pools that will explode in your mouth they uh they have ... different types of Apple's it's sort of called the apple ... for that reason and\nThe food the people that calmness um if you can imagine it calmer than astray there already is it has its own special piece and it's much cold down there so it's very ... very alive it has some of the most beautiful national pox I think in the world\nAnd you can walk them uh the cradle mountain walk and the ... along the coast you can do them via companies say stay in Athens the whole way which is pretty nice or you can free will get yourself um\nThat they really a world heritage walks and um it's it's one of the most beautiful places I think that's the thing ...\nIt sounds just and chanting if I'm a big fan of uh\nAn stole Jake old fashioned liquid Australia from the Nineteen fifties because I started getting into a place to go home and it inspires me to go to Australia and trying to find a quiet Eddie from the past are there any places in Australia where you might feel like you're back in the Nineteen fifties\nMaybe in small towns along the way\nAre there any places in Australia where you might feel like you're back in the Nineteen fifties\nMaybe in small towns along the way [laughter] um but not really in the major cities um the rocks obviously in Sydney which is where the ... bridge is\nA is maintained and has historical walks where you can hear the history of each building and how it was built and again the fence dying and the convicts\nBut for me what a stray really has to offer varies in nature and often these communities that we've been talking about like for example there's a place called ... which is at Cape ... on the west coast of Australia right up the top it's a\nAn indigenous run place that you can go and it has five star tents and then to stop hot so it fits everyone's brief\nAnd it takes a day to drive there or you can fly there and a small airplane and that really gives you an idea of the remoteness of Australia and how isolated in lifted learn it really is to the rest of the world and to me that the eighty or looking for when you come to this place the can they\nCan be a place of complete solitude which when I go to America I Know they also have places like that\nBut I'm In Australia that they seem almost like you're the only person there seemingly laying Tasmania this place called wine glass by that you can do any walking to and I remember the time me and my husband went in there was absolutely\nNobody that so we went skinny dipping water\nAnd I don't I don't really think it was just extraordinary and\nUm and not far from a major hub where you can have a beautiful meal and some delicious wine so um I think you're less searching for the Nineteen fifties and more things with that timeless place but I feel like if you get it straight off as a", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "14"}
