V. guide because it was so new he didn't believe anything was going to come of it he didn't want to die and TV [noise] um but she was the only game in town they offered him a\nLot to be the host of their weekly anthology and and he took it and it it just it just it is it that's one of the the great coincidence the coincidences of American politics I think yes he ... he he went into this medium mastered it\nAnd then he hit his political stride just says that that same meeting was taking over American politics yes and not only that this is where Reagan\nBeing the spokesperson for GE rarely finds his political voice it happens right here because part of the job was that they asked him not only to be their host\nBut during the week when he wasn't on camera to be the ... and that in town his going through a almost all the G E plants in the United states and there were many with\nTens of thousands of people working on them to just talk to people and hear what was on their mind or to talk about politics to talk about government and he gets a sense of the working person and what is missing in their own life\nAnd how the government is affecting them I I Know you did a lot of detailed research you did you did you did you cut out where those GE factories were geographically\nI mean the biggest ones were on the east coast but you know across the country there were there were many major plants a and he hit them all\nYou know Jim here's where we see one of the real parallels between a Reagan and and and Trump I mean first of all of course they both came out of the entertainment industry\nBut it was during his time a General Electric Bob's bits tells us that Reagan started to get a feel for the working man and woman in this country that\nThe blue collar the real working people of the country and he started to get a sense of what they needed once they want it and he started to get a sense of its own politics he had always been a liberal Democrat\nIn people of the country and he started to get a sense of what they needed what they want it and he started to get a sense of its own politics he had always been a liberal Democrat I mean he was one of the standard bearers for FDR's policies\nSince he was a little boy his father was a an FDR guy and Reagan really believed in the whole package it wasn't until he got out there and talk to the people that she\nThat we see a shift starting to go right and it's it really goes to the right [noise]\nUm ... and and\nIt moved into conservative politics at a ... he ended up campaigning for for Richard Nixon and sixty\nRight and then I recalled water ... he was still identify as a Democrat to win I think I Would wanted him to stay a Democrat they did Nixon sent a note that said work and this guy's talking Republican politics but we need him as a Democrat for our costs\nTime to pick the vice presidential candidate Reagan didn't want to pick Bush because of that night he said I don't want a man second to me who has no nerve who lost his nerve he could only focus on that night with George Bush yeah it was a remarkable moment and\nLet's talk about what that is is is not unusual for the behavior of Ronald Reagan one of the reasons that he was either ... or despised\nWas his willingness to be incredibly forceful to push his will and two weeks to exert his will and that\nWe that scene plays after his entire Providence\nAbsolutely right he the one thing you know I Will tell you that Reagan was not always the smartest man in the room and he knew it he didn't understand the big complex issues but he had a gut instinct and when he believed in something\nHe was behind it a hundred percent he wasn't going to let anything stand in the way and so later on of course we get Star Wars we get Reaganomics\nAnd we get the the the the index cards year after year after year which don't change which don't change and when someone goes off script he's not able to uh to really follow that script\nYou're after year after year which don't change which don't change and when someone goes off script he's not able to uh to really follow that script and I had to go off script to comprehend something so\nBut as long as we're we're we're again we're comparing Reagan to Trump I think that the one thing that strikes me out of out of your your book Bob is is that Reagan Reagan Reagan understood the power of charisma and the power of the personal touch but he also understood he he knew what he didn't know\nHe did absolutely you know people always say to me well Reagan was in a big uh\nA deep thinker by his thinking was deeply felt that the difference and people in through it and that right away and understood it and and I think that's really what made him so forth Fox\nYou know you said a minute ago that you know Reagan didn't know how you deal with it wasn't the best informed a guy a guy who got sees the nets them call so one of the quotes in your book that really jumped out at me and I don't know where you found this\nWas A L hey who worked for ms his first secretary's day no I covered el hage presidential brief\nPresidential campaign and I know what a difficult character he could be but found you quote him as saying rate is not a mean man just stupid to echoes what this is Bob Woodward writing about the Trump White house yeah well\nThe difference is the word mean you're say Reagan\nWas not a main man [noise] um and he didn't have a hostile bone in his body I'm a ... and\nAlso the difference too is that Reagan to unite or you know I mean that's that was his whole goal ... if you want to draw a comparison to to the man today um Barrett is before the break you call him a unite or yeah let's let's listen\nTo a moment in which he really had to bring the country together you set the\nSpace shuttle challenger on it is but the manner in which they live their lives\nThey prepared for their journey and waved goodbye\nThe bonds of earth [noise]\nTouch the face of God\nThe president of the United states addressing the country in the aftermath of the challenger explosion but you set this up force there was another man who was supposed to take center stage that day was the Davis a state of the union address I'll live with his state of the union\nYou're explosion but you set this up force there was another man who was supposed to take center stage that day was the Davis a state of the union address\nI'll live with his state of the union address has aptly right and uh [noise]\nAnd and it wasn't going to be well thought out yeah he was having a rough time he was in fact ... was a disaster disaster exactly right that people weren't buying\nThe strategic Defense Initiative and ... and his popularity believe it or not was it thirty five percent of the day after he gives that speech about the challenger\nHis his popularity hit Seventy percent [noise]\nThis is this is this is the key difference between Ronald Reagan and Donald ... Silver Lake Ronald Reagan understood the power of a good script and he knew what a good script was said you had good script writers yeah\nHe was also a great performer he was a great performer and I have to tell you that a lot of those speeches and he gave he wrote himself believe it or not he wrote them out long hand\nHe had people polished them afterwards but he um\nHe was a pretty good uh a pretty good writer on and on his own merits\nAll right we got to get to another break no let's do that we've got so much more to talk about um one of the things that Bob is your book ... ... ... ... it's you have a gripping account of the day or early in his tenure two months in\nThat uh he was almost murdered in this essay assassination attempt we'll talk about that and a lot more when we come back with Bob spits author of Reagan an American Jeremy\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listen to cover the rising cost of the programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life\nPlease take a moment now to make an on line contribution ... dot org and click donate at the top of the page\nYour contribution at whatever level is right for you fly out and cover the cost of the programs you live on ...\nThank you so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting\nFive space and Jim Galloway with me in the studio today I'm five march thirtieth Nineteen eighty one that's literally two months of the day he was he was a ... January twenty isn't a Nineteen eighty one two months later he is giving a speech at a hotel in downtown Washington what happens\nHe's coming out of the speech in a speech he didn't want to give it was to a union people as a matter of fact ah people who weren't going to vote for him\nWhat happens or he's coming out of the speech in a speech he didn't want to give it to a union people as a matter of fact\nAh people who weren't gonna vote for him and so he went as a matter of courtesy because he said he wanted and as he's walking out on a young man appears from the crowd and fires several shots let's listen to how CNN broken ooh it's news programming to give this special report\n... shots reported fired outside the hotel or President Reagan's fall short while the goal here is Bernard shaw in our Washington really\nTails are very sketchy at this moment we don't know precisely what happened we don't know the sequence first of all the president has said we're told that shots were fired as funny as you look at the hotel\nThe district of Columbia metropolitan police report that at least one police officer and one Secret Service agents have been injured they were shot down their condition we do not know\nThe president was not safe it's understandable and the scramble to get this story out of media leap apparently even the White House was putting out word that Reagan was safe even his Secret Service or\nA person will when they put them into a car I thought that\nYou know he just had the wind knocked out of him he was he was he was thrown into the car the agent you describe it vividly throws himself right on top of Reagan Reagan said cherry get off me I feel like you're breaking my ribs I Can't breathe yeah I'm a big he's taken the George Washington hospital yeah\nWhere he is closer to death than many people realize to this day it was touching girl I mean the odd thing was he had just bought those gorgeous news\nAnd as he's laying on the gurney they're cutting they realize he's been hit and they're cutting the suit off of them and re can can at least rap scene in and out of consciousness but he comes to one point he says hey hey hold on you're ruining my suit I mean you know it was\nThere was a it was almost comical but it was it was touch and go and there was a very good chance that at one point that he would not make it you know Galloway it\nYou know how we always we were you when you play in our mind certain things that people say to us and later we say oh if I had only said vis well the doctor who operated on Reagan had a moment in which he got it right Reagan says to him as or go into surgery I Hope you're a Republican and the doctor says we're\nAll Republicans today that's right and the doctor was a a lefty affect us get up\nA Republican and the doctor says we're all Republicans today that's right and the doctor was a a lefty where they'll get a\nUh it's it they couldn't find the wounded or no no it wouldn't be the bullet when I was just a tiny twenty two was an it was a twenty two and a ... he had filed the he had filed the bullet\nBut also when it went through it went through a groove in the car and flat and so it was the shape of a dime when I entered Reagan they they could barely see the sweat that went through his body and so they had a very hard time finding that that fall it\nAnd and and removing it to\nHis ah his numbers shot back up again in the aftermath of that you um\nYou know you hate to think that that's necessary\nAnd Reagan Reagan is I think he said joking what you said you know if I could only get shot every day the way my numbers are going to probably\nHad was a course number one\nHis economic plan never accomplished what he believed what you know Bush he hated George W H W. Bush among other things for about ... lives forever and the campaign and never quite got over George W saying that\nBoat Reaganomics became as negative a label as voodoo economics at\nBed [laughter] that's true and I but even today the Reagan people and says that fat economic program saved our country on it they were ... this is one thing that they're ... they're wrong\nIf I if I could take it back to the the the is a passionate nation that took", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "08"}
