you're out here for political rewind bill ... a boy I don't know about you but the week's events this past week I've got me completely wrong out thank goodness we have a panel here that's still very energized to talk about all that's been going on and we start with\nThe Asia lead political writer Jim Galloway you read them in a Wednesday in Sunday paper and of course he oversees the political insider blog it agency aren't you it's like it's hard to keep up\nJim ... the kind of it's the countdown counting down today yes that's right that's what that's what kills me Patricia Murphy\nIs with us too she has been involved in politics on the hill a for a long time she worked for um\nSam Nunn and max Cleveland ... sticking in him and she is a columnist for both the Daily Beast and roll call thanks for joining us today to marry America Oliver democratic state\nRepresentative is here with us today at one point we're going to talk to you 'cause you're in the courtroom during this\nA voter suppression case that went down I'm looking forward to getting your observations have made it a wonderful job okay a says the Democrat who was very happy with the result is\nRepublican strategist Brian Robin ... is with us he of course served as Nathan Deal is communications director during the governor's first term and now is doing consulting work with the Republicans including your big one\nIs amendment number four ... slot right that's right if you care about crime victims rights yeah earned a little of the money you know [laughter] All right Jim what started we can't I'm One\nThings we've said on the show for a while now is that candidates in Georgia for governor for Congress other races have tended they've been focusing on they've been staying home in terms of the issues they want to focus on that's all changed really in the last week at least suddenly nationally\nAnd they've been staying home in terms of the issues they want to focus on\nThat's all changed really in the last week at least suddenly national issues are playing a bigger role that's a fair way of saying the maybe the biggest one being a the discovery of the pipe bombs that went out to a prominent critics of President Trump\nAre not interested in the case um and suddenly a you've got\nA both Brian cap and Stacey Abrams talking about that as they go out on the stump\nYou know you're you are and you're you're you're going to find that Stacey Abrams is here to more year to talk about it then Brian Kemp just given given the the the profile that we have the fellow who who's been arrested in the python cases\nUh and and and it spoils the other hot button issue was for a for Republicans which is to keep wanting people to this those parade of refugees that are a thousand miles ... miles away in in in Mexico\nWell let's let's deal with that for a second I'm shortly before the arrest was made in this case of President Trump's set out a tweet which speaks to exactly what Jim is talking about let me show it\nAnd read it and then ask everybody to a response here's what the president said Republicans are doing so well early voting at the polls it now this bomb stuff\nHappens and momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote Brian it feels like\nAnd this isn't a particularly unique observation everything the president sees is filtered through this political mid term lines\nI don't really understand that ... so I don't really know how can that can kind of you deeply on it because I don't\nKnow when you need them out you know the political coverage is slowing and momentum and smelling [noise] I I don't necessarily agree with that Republican momentum as pretty strong right now I don't think that this has this is only a national conversation going on around us\nAnd I was disheartened to see both sides coming out with the wild theories about what it was we had no facts about who it was the other day Republicans saying it was a false flag attack me a year Democrats using a phrase such as they have arms who said it was a fascination attempt\nThat we all know that we didn't know that are going to find out more now that there's been harassed ... the right person but\nI disagree with the underlying premise that this was hurt Republicans in some level that wasn't my premise\nAnd we're going to find out more now that there's been harassed by the right person but I disagree with the underlying premise that this was hurt Republicans in some ways it was hard for him is usually what we do here that's what he's saying I get I I'm confused by the tweet frankly Patricia\nTrack and we'll talk about him and I know like an accident lovely young man from Georgia in fact\nIt's so Jim let's go back to the injection of national issues come into a state races theater when of course is the care or the president has really really whipped up a frenzy about bees who knows six thousand five thousand seven thousand I hear numbers all over the map\nPeople who are marching through Central America maybe to the southern border may be ... really don't know week he spent eight hundred troops us troops to the border to beef things up but to be things up in anticipate in anticipation of a a foot bones caravan\nThat might get to Texas by February right so let's with that in mind I'm let's hear how in the it suddenly in Jersey congressional races a Republican candidates have picked up on this theme here was a debate or in the sixth district race or in which\nKaren Handel was facing off a Democrat Lucy and we pass and this is where Karen Handel said\nWhen I Do support is legal found immigration I Would hope that all of us can agree that a caravan with thousands of people working its way to our border in an effort to storm into our country is something that we cannot have it underscores exactly why we my cab border security I support\nThe law I support when ever measures we must take to secure the border\nAs long as we're there let's listen to what Lucy McBath so I said about the same subject\nI Do believe that we should have strong security and law enforcement at the borders\nShould have vetting but I Do believe that we should be looking at each in every case individually we should not be assuming that people that are coming here from war torn nations are coming here for political asylum are the keys and criminals\n[noise] so uh Patricia uh\nThey're from war torn nations or coming here for political asylum are the keys and criminals\n[noise] so uh Patricia or the president has successfully introduced this issue into every congressional race virtually across the country and and killed a pipe bombs he was dominating headlines by talking about another kind of Bob the caravan headed\nNorth well immigration specifically illegal immigration has always been the bread and butter for this president\nI was interested in this debate on that Karen Handel who I think most of these races they are trying to keep this highly localized she went hard nationally I think the word storm in particular that to me she's made the calculation she needs to get her Republican base voters\nOut even if she could offend some more moderate\nUm more moderate Republicans with the way she characterized people coming to this country at least the Macbeth on the other hand I thought had a particular for a Democrat and the cycle on of the more measured response says there's no talk about abolishing ice there's no talk about um you know I'm On the whole idea about immigration at all that I Know of\nUm but that was more measured and a number of other Democrats I think she's playing a lot more toward the middle and ... can't handle I heard they're playing it more to the right\nThe north storm is a code word a bad word the feel of these unfortunate people carrying their children on their shoulders he might arrive at a dribble in February of courses of factually dishonest picture to try to put forward to the voters in the sixth and seventh congressional district\nEvery Democrat I Know starts with we must have border security we must have border security spending thirty billion dollars on a wall is not border security it's how you do it and what our philosophies are and whether or not you're trying to scare people or whether you're trying to do it honestly is the issue that you you you know\nWhat I find really interesting about this is is\nIt it's it's it's the Republican Republican\nKind of accepting Trump's measure\nOf the situation because I as a as Patricia so it I mean I mean immigration has always been Trump's closer ... I mean it was it was this time in in in in in in sixteen does what he was totally open or two on the front of our you know where where do you think that in in the traditional Republican instinct\nWould be to go back to those tax cuts that were passed in December and point to the economy and and to be great\nIn in in the traditional Republican instinct would be to go back to those tax cuts that were passed in December and point to the ... economy and and the these great job numbers and and the growth and that's not but that's yeah that's what's happening\nRyan I Wonder um as a consultant as a Republican consultant\nIt's got to be a little ... you don't have a congressional candidate in in this cycle of by ... I think you know I don't really have any political candidate okay that's right okay so it it is is is is that tactic you would settle line is it frustrating that the tax cut hasn't resonated that the unemployment rate\nHasn't really resonated is is the is the caravan something you would advise a Republican to really focus on at this point\nWhere we ask him to Karen Handel and a care at all which is to say local\nI thought caring response was fantastic I I agree I agree with every word that she said in that debate about Robert ... response was really good to\nVisit I Would definitely encourage it because it goes really even beyond\nA hard core Republicans a lot of independents agree we got a broken system uh my friend Mary Margaret sad or at least you know these people their children and they\nThey're just trying to seek safety that real prospect of other Democrats which in in the solution well they need us just Molly Molly wind it will not look good before how as not dribble it twelve million illegal immigrants in this country that's not a dribble\nSomething that has that is directly impacting our nation\nEver in that country gets to fourteen or Fifteen Percent of the population being foreign born just throughout our entire history there was a reaction historically high levels are looking\nOut for him but number one the twelve million had been there that's nothing new but it's not that's not new but it's I mean we've been arguing about that since since Nineteen Ninety All right I guess my question is why does does than distant friend on a border Crump\nA really sound economic message\nI think the message is part of it I\nDon't think that you go out and talk about it because people know it I mean people have to have people know that things are good in their neighborhoods like in twenty can they knew they were bad and they have their neighborhoods so glance talking about it and claiming credit for is important and they are\nBut that doesn't exclude all other issues and immigration is an issue that Americans care deeply about\nYou know talking about it and claiming credit for is important and they are\nWhat they've done exclude all other issues in immigration is an issue that Americans care deeply about and the Democrats have become so extreme on the issue how our baby normal remind me of it comes on his way into the remark\nPower to the extreme I mean it was like Patricia brought up the talking about abolishing ice that's something that's become part of the mainstream part of democratic\nAs a means to me by the Democratic talking points that's what a number of the Democrats are getting the most press on the issue are calling to abolish ice which is something I'd never heard before until this cycle there I just don't know if it's mainstream and Lincoln\nHere right here in Georgia Stacey Abrams calling for a new immigrants to get hope scholarships if they are but it was time\nFor another guy that's what that means a lot of money All right Mary murdered you get the last word before I take a break\nThank you David how I was in the Senate district part of it than the current house district there are thousands small businesses legally operating where you go to restaurants where I go to restaurants the economic viability of different highway is a dramatic example of positive emigration\nResults we need to do better with integration we need to protect our borders and we need to fix what is\nTruly brother and I do want to take one more moment on this up because obviously there's disagreement Patricia whether Mary Margaret Brian agree on whether the president ought to be a you know whipping up fear about the Caribbean\nHis approval ratings have gone up and it appears that the gap in energy between Republican voters and democratic voters has tightened so it appears that to some extent it may be working\nWell I don't know exactly which part of it is working and certainly in Georgia and the most recent poll the president's approval rating is that forty nine percent which is quite high I mean you're getting into normal territory\nBecause the economy is unbelievable right now I have to sort of re read the economic numbers as they come out because there are just almost so eye popping leap out in the economy\nWas good ... a month ago two months ago when the president's approval rating wasn't as high end when it appeared that Democrats were much more energized to turn out to vote so there does seem to be something happening here with the president's ah a rhetoric\nSure I think so I think there's probably still alive positive effect for Republicans from the Kavanaugh hearings I think that there will suffer a lot of Republicans to say and I remember when I was upset\nProbably still allied positive effect after Republican from the ... hearings I think that there was a lot of Republicans to say and I remember ... when the first place [laughter]\nYou know cell and that and that's why they like to spend it in a ... exactly what happened with Brett Kavanaugh is who they wanted and it's how they wanted it it got done very calm and it was a very high profile that day for the fact that\nI I turning point because Republicans who maybe don't like Donald Trump who Democrats how they shot at a Democrat from minded those people a lot they didn't like Brian ...\nAll right let's do this or we want to get a break and when we come back I Want to talk a little more about the governor's race Jim we've seen on NBC News poll that has some really interesting uh numbers in it and we should talk a bit about bad uh will do that after this break\n[noise]\nBut let's listen to what met said toward the end of the debate the other night\nI Am here before you fast for your vote this is going to be a runoff anyway if you're tired of the two party system and a two party tyranny of the oligarchs warning the planet than a vote for me as a protest vote to show them that you're sick and tired of the same old stuff\nBasically being a libertarian is leave me alone don't tell me what to do and don't steal my stuff\nBrian ... the NBC poll has him at four percent and ... oh my God that's enough for a runoff yeah I Do want to say that I tweeted outback quote that he used there because I thought it really spoke to me they\nLeave me alone without running into that a fair in Johnson\nWere here he would say that's the Senate of all of you Brookhaven three car\nGarage but what about this\nNotion that we could be headed for a run off I think is a distinct possibility and I want to correct what I said earlier I misspoke when I say that the moms and you\nThey seemed to me\nI misspoke when I say that the moms and you\nThey seemed to me about the poll I\nI was wrong I think the poll is wrong I think it's a bad number I think if if they have the black vote at twenty five percent that Brian Kemp sleep we will be much bigger in that sample but then it was so I I think it's about ... percent I mean they never really get more than two so let's see\nEven even ... where do you care nobody's over fifty percent\nHonestly believe that Brian Kemp is two to three points a hat and I think that he's going to win between four and five points\nPatricia I'm we haven't seen the candidate break fifty percent in ... in any polling on this\nWe have that we've um and we haven't I don't think thing ever her in the lead at all and end well very early very early and but I think ah Georgia's tend to go about ... percent I don't know that Mr Mann says performance for the ... plus percent on but this race is still closed it feels so close\nI wouldn't be surprised that prior went off I don't think that on anybody who is voting for Mr Mets would seriously have been a real vote for anybody else I think that somebody just going out to vote on the state of affairs in the world\nBut I thought that was there but I thought you said that he was he didn't vote for me it was a protest vote if he's\nHe's running as a disruptor yeah and and you know ... that that's kind of what Trump also maybe he's trying to peel off just a sliver of that I Would do on the on the run off\nI Would think you know on on election night you know I Will be I've I've got a vacation at steaks well I'm In a runoff for governor but I think it's far more likely that you're going to see a runoff in those two in one of those two don't face a down ballot here the\nRaces yeah okay I think we're looking at around ... yours or you were looking at a runoff in the governor's race here and possibly others to particularly the governor's race okay is it Mary murdered as long as we're talking about a potential run off I saw a political insider this may have been actually you're writing\nA gym or if there is a run off the election will be on December force Nathan Deal has called a special session beginning on the level of certainty that memory and her teeth Brian Kemp if he's still secretary of state\nWould have to recuse himself from any fundraising during the time of the special session\nTheir teeth Brian Kemp if he is still secretary of state would have to recuse himself from any fundraising during the time of the special session is that finally the moment Brian Kemp decided to time to give up his job\nHas me because he hasn't gotten enough salary for two thousand eight to ... maybe it's just wants a salary for that wouldn't surprise me at all that would be a significant stopped in sunrise thing for that four or five days then we'll and special session\nLast week when we're going to seek kept stepped out if there was a run up you know he great boosting asked him during the debate you didn't want to repeat cues yourself or or give up your job during the election or if there's a ... said would you recuse yourself from that and the camp basically said no but\nWhat happens if there's a special uh if if there is a runoff busy give it up to it and keep raising money\nWell he's been very loath to average sign up to this point I'm from talking letters I think it led up probably in front of the confidence in the election results if he were to recuse himself will have to see any\n... going to be more attention to the capital it's going to be more attention to if we're in a runoff which is what I fear\nBut as you but if if there if there is a runoff there will be tremendous pressure crying on governor deal and on a did this mob of legislators in the state capital to promote business just say the fast as I can get a bill through I think it's fine danger\nAnd and I wouldn't expect it to be a tick beyond that\nLet's do this so let's say a final breaking the show when we come back we had an important ruling in a federal lawsuit over alleged voter suppression a we have with somebody who's in the courtroom to watch how those arguments unfolded and we have a panel of experts who can comment on what they think happened you're a this is political
