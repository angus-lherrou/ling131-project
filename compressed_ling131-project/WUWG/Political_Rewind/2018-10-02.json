Riley who is with us had asked a question about\nThere's very few undecided the left in his poem that mimics other polling we've seen those three ... plus percent maybe [noise]\nSo what do you do to win this race moving forward is basically Kevin's question\nCandidates are going to focus on their base and trying to get their base to turn out to vote\nSo what do you do to win this race moving forward is basically Kevin's question\nCandidates are going to focus on their base in trying to get their base to turn out to vote\nOn that and is undecided group there could be some people who are ... that there could be people who are\nVery conflicting end or low information and and so if you don't know a lot about the race if you're not following it closely and you're undecided and you're not particularly motivated um towards one candidate or another that's the type of person who are less likely to turn out and vote\nAnd they're both candidates would do well to focus on folks who they have a better shot of actually being able to get out to the people that they've been cultivating people that they've been in contact with people that they know you know could be somewhat ... off\nThe market the conventional wisdom I think you're correct me you're a pollster and hungry you know a lot about polling too\nIs at a certain point in a poll of your polling two weeks out or something and you have three plus percent undecided\nI Am I right that you kind of right so it was what you said well these people are undecided they're just not interested they're not likely to turn out I think I'm right about that but this six weeks out five weeks out they can still be moved or who I got that whole thing wrong\nWell here's here's because every type of\nPolling has a strengthen a weakness that type of polling we were employing for this particular poll was ivy are\nFor a person what does that mean indoor looser it it's it's the recorded calls pole and cause you will I just don't care I'm but here's the thing that one reason that you're seeing a lower undecided and the landmark polls and you might in another kind of polling operation is that if you sit through ten ... recorded questions\nYou're dedicated a little more than somebody who will listen to three questions so we do a lot of three question polls there's nothing wrong with that\nUm as long as you know we can make sure that is correct but if you have three questions people will set to that if you do ten questions they won't said drives down the undecided writing so are are I I have to think that are undecided rating is a little artificially low um but doesn't mean it's wrong it just means we kind of squeezed out people that don't care\nGiven I think the headline on this though has to be right now or the landmark poll confirms what you saw it and your first poll of the general election race this thing is a toss up for the time being at least\nAnd we were talking about that or get earlier um his wonder when it might break you know because we've seen this before or it seems close but\nWe used ... and we were talking about the er again earlier um [noise] you just wonder when it might break you know because we've seen this before or it seems close but ah I think the polls are only kidding this is for real close unlike what happened in the last gubernatorial race when it was closer than it was close and then it wasn't\nGoing to throw in one additional piece of information on us so we were doing polling at the time for W. S. B. in two thousand fourteen I have to give them the shot up\nAnd I'm In that race at this particular point Jason Carter still barely led the race he was a within a very just as a very small fraction but he was actually leading the race against governor deal\nOn October nights we polled again and that's the point where governor deal tied Carter and then from there forward\nLed the race that this has changed this it's changed this year but I think the Kavanaugh hearings have identified all over again for everyone how partisan a lot of politics has ended his push to people earlier than normal to pick a team so to speak and I think there is a\nTremendous kickback we talked a little before the show started but it's I think is becoming a real kick back\nAgainst Democrats I think they're they're overreaching now when they're starting to look at your books and comments people wrote in your books and ice being thrown forty years ago in a bar I mean it's ... it's too much and I think it's starting to hurt Democrats in what you're seeing that in Georgia now\nIt last point bill I'm In two thousand fourteen at this exact same point it was October seventh two thousand fourteen we were in the field with a poll\nAnd I'm just looking at this now the libertarian in that year had five percent of the vote this year it's only two\nPercent of which shows you a lot about the part as soon as you to join Republicans in the rest of hunger what's your take on what you just heard from work\nSo I asked mark ... let me look at the top lines from last year and then looking at those class has one of the things that got me when I look at look at polls for another station\nWouldn't be the variability in terms of who was being sampled and the poll so oftentimes unfolds where Carter was dealing better their tended to be more African American respond that I'm In the new we're getting more Democrats kind of into the mix at the end of the day based on the exit polling that thing that that hurt Carter and the thing that hurt\nMichele nine really was on the under performance among white voters and so I think it's a question as to what's the combination of race and party\nSo I think that this time around ... we were to Jordan told us yesterday twenty five percent of the white votes are say they're going to a a Abrams venue weighed African American voted a third one and a half percent we're waiting to twenty nine\nOr say they're going to a a Abrams venue weighed African American vote a third one and a half percent we're waiting to\nTwenty nine and two thousand fourteen which almost was dead on by the way\nRight so what does that mean to you I under\nI mean it's not surprising that mark would wait African Americans up because of the fact that this was a historic first candidacy then you know there is likely going to be some greater interest among African American voters if that turns out to be wrong then and Abrams would probably would be a little further behind\n'em on this depending on what the weights look like and I think the other sort of big sort of the question is what the white Democrat Dale\nAnd in this particular race and that was that was actually really really hard to sample and you know sampling you know as as much art as it is science and do that it's nobody's fault but it's just a question of trying to understand why\nI'm you know if the numbers don't turn out the way that we anticipate if African American turnout at thirty one percent in this race where does that stand historically\nIt's not enough she needs thirty to at least thirty two to realistically have average Americans ever turned out at thirty two percent of the gubernatorial race in Toronto and in fact Obama was thirty two thousand and two thousand and eight\nOf the state has grown the electorate is grown larger African American population it's there it's in a radical voting behavior they're not voting and solid numbers yet\nBut um they they are going to need to get that to probably thirty two percent in order to win I think\nI mean and what I Would argue with that it's not just blacks cell I mean there's no way Stacey Abrams wins this race and just getting African American votes it's a question of what do other folks just to put them on the racial coalition together and said what most people are also looking at it you got to have robust turnout among blacks but she also can't do terribly among white voters\nTo breakfast before we do that's a great point when you have her winning twenty five percent of the white vote or what does she probably needed if she's going to win the election got to be above twenty five percent\nRight out to be maybe a little bit more but not a whole lot more obviously if if the African American population drops back in voting she has to do better with white voters\n... suggested is cold at least to the white voters oh she's doing okay with them she's just got to pump up the rest of the voting population as to the next segment I guess you're going to have some ... absentee ballot ... yeah we got to get to a break or we will talk about the absentee ballots that are coming in already\nUh we'll do all that right after uh Sarah Andrew talk to you about becoming a partner of ours\nBy pledging to GPA the radio\nReady or we'll do all that right after uh Sarah Andrew talk to you about becoming a partner of ours by pledging to

a bus of Bill Nye get and I just wanted to point out\nAnd ... and everybody I Would just like to point out some of the wonderful feedback that we get\nDoesn't bother you know I'll be honest it doesn't bother me as much ... and you know it's a it's a public area that the question will be you know it's a it's an unusual circumstance considering the history United States with airports airlines\nSo that that could have been a little bit intimidating but I think Facebook Live and handheld cameras are going to result in all of us in public life for more really of Apollo view a having a ... a more and more you know aggressive aggressive behavior to get on camera\nOr is this is this just a grassroots people speaking out\nI call a grassroots lobbying yeah and I think part of the reason why people feel that they have to resort to that is that I mean there may be a certain sense of desperation they feel that this is the only way that they're going to be heard\nUm you know for elected officials who are putting a situation um you know I'm not terribly comfortable with a costing people at dinner renting them out of writer on right on the other hand people are um\nMeet these people when they put themselves into positions of leadership they also give up a measure of their privacy and they're supposed to be in dialogue with constituents on a regular basis and to have somebody you know feels that\nI was into positions of leadership they also give up a measure of their privacy and they're supposed to be in dialogue with constituents on a regular basis and to have somebody you know feels that you know trying to get a meeting with you isn't going to work or like you would not my email or my tweet than the only way that I can get your attention has to walk up to you in public\nAnd that's fine I mean you know another sort of more crass and says I'm you know sort of dimension famous people deal with stuff all the time where people walk up to them and ask them to sign weird stuff and do all these kinds of things so I mean if you want to be in a position of leadership you should expect that people are going to walk up to you and tell you how to do your job on a pretty regular\nRiley gets at all the time ... up to him asking them for a week off\nI mean he's a tough guy he's this does not bother somebody like David ...\nWe're going to go back to us or Andrew a
