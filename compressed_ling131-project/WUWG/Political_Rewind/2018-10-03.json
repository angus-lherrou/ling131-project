grateful to you for\nSending us your contributions thank you so very much for doing that\nPatricia Murphy you wrote a roll call piece that I saw for the first time a yesterday\nAnd here's what we'd solve all the questions left unanswered after the Judiciary Committee hearings for Brett Kavanaugh ended last week the hardest one to know for sure might be also be the most important for the long term health of the country\nCan be saved after everything that happened last week and you go on to write a very balanced please Democrats and Republicans what do you mean by that\nWatching the Kavanaugh hearings on fall it got so personal not chance between the nominee and\nWatching the Kavanaugh hearings unfold eight that person will not change between the nominee and the senators but between the senators themselves and I think there is the ... when Senator Graham looked across the hearing room and said\nThat you know something to the extent as\nYou\n[noise] [noise]\nThe primary entry points to his issue to national\nPeriodic his girl to the United states beginning to be I mean and they get to to do and this is a test of the national emergency alert system the system was developed by broadcast and cable operators have both Terry cooperation with the federal emergency management agency that Federal Communications commission\nAnd local authorities to keep you informed in the event of an emergency if this had been an actual divergence you end up there so message you would have\nFun with the alerts when you heard at the start of this message a similar wireless emergency alert his message has been sent to us so those invitations some cell phones will receive the message oh there's one new action is required\n\nOf me right now but of course we have to point out you're cutting out one of the better like members by Republicans or Democrats or right\nNow about how the not right now that's a buddy\nWell let me say without so Lindsey Graham golf like that I thought I was watching Saturday Night live just pour second but you've got to remember that we all based on our\nAttitudes you an idea there's a lot of life experiences and I think the fact that a Lindsey Graham never has been married staff know why for our daughters might might affect twos attitude but at the same time\nThis is a place that ought to be a sort of build a stability and has been over the years and I'm confident enough to think that once this little explosion happens\nOr business will go back as usual and the Senate will be able to get his business done what caused the Senate has to operate in in order for our country to operate credit sweat you way you know this\nIs Lindsey was my congressman when I Lived in South Carolina I've always admired him quite a lot and found it would be very reasonable and\nAnd why would you weigh in on this well\nLindsay was my congressman when I Lived in South Carolina I've always admired him quite a lot and found it would be very reasonable and I've had several conversations with them um that was uncharacteristic because the Lindsey Graham I had known\n'em and I was sad to see it because it was a moment when it was not the Senate at its best and I'm afraid that the Senate's norms of ... and\nTherefore ins have rooted quite a lot and it began um while back and I think that one of the problems is\nNot having confirmation hearings and not just for the last couple of Supreme Court justices but going back to judges that were being appointed in the Clinton Administration when you don't have confirmation hearings you begin to set up um or confirmation votes you begin to set up animosity between each side and there are a lot of grudges\nUm that have been around for a while and I'm afraid the current climate is just bringing them all to the forefront\nPatricia you also point out when Kavanaugh was being questioned by Democrats um among other things at one point we became a rather famous or a pizza clip\nAmy call before I was talking to him about his what did he ever drink socially blacked out and he shot back setback at her I don't know did you ever drink till you're blacked out and you point out in the old days it wouldn't have something else would have happened is that moment\nHe would have heard of cattle and the chairman would have said\nAh I just have to add right now this is not the way that we we would expect a witness to address senator on there is just the level of decorum and behaviors sort of in the room that is typically\nExpected and we'd be much missed I think if this is permanent because these people work together every day and there are so many levels of that\nWhere you have to build trust and when somebody a center a ... attack and it is not responded to by anybody else on the committee I was actually shocked but it didn't but I Do also point out in my piece\nThat this is that as soon as I think a long time coming and Democrats and Republicans absolutely barren equal weight for how we got here\nI like buddy jump in I Want to point out that this is not anything new when I was working for which would be rough for years and years ago a Ralph Yarborough from Texas tried to pull Strom Thurmond into a\nCommittee hearing room because I needed him to make a court or a Corum Strom Thurmond resisted and they got into a wrestling match owned out in the hall outside of the committee room and Strom Thurmond pinned him on a try\nFrom thermal resisted and they got into a wrestling match\nOwned out in the hall outside of the committee room and Strom Thurmond pinned him\nAs this goes up and down right now of course we're to Nader but things will get better and I think the Senate will go to another another area of comedy and it goes up and down because the Senate to do any business any buys benefit is got to work and they would make\nIt more criticism that exactly what we're seeing in polling all over the place that the voters that Americans don't any longer believe that Congress does work that they are capable of doing anything it is a peculiar\nTime right now and I'm hoping that we will as buddies I'd go back to sort of a normal time yeah there's a time when we go back to the civil war when one congressman king another senator so it's we haven't had that\nBut um we are at a point where we are dismantling norms that are troubling to me one of the things that I just mention that I watch the hearing I didn't see all of the of the morning but I saw all the afternoon and I thought that moment with senator club which are was unique in the sense that I thought senator club which are actually handled herself\nIncredibly well in that moment and retain dignity in a moment which wasn't necessarily the most dignified moments\nIn the Senate but I I think there were some Democrats that did not do very good job of maintaining that dignity\nIt's what Patricia said that's plenty of blame to go around on both sides I don't think there's any question about this but they had one problem do that\nKind of came out that do wish for his sake could happen because frankly I've got Calvin off fatigue but the one thing that uh our disappointed about is that if you're going to be a judge you got to show a certain temperament\nAnd you've got to show a shirt and restraint and he lost\nIt All right I I I got to agree I Am glad to say that I Want to get to know their pledge break because I don't want to litigate Kavanaugh's confirmation show if you make a point right now we're rich with yours\nIs political remind listeners supported CPB where we have
