o'clock Wednesday so you've got that odd situation where you have to find something completely different to write about now is that they are trying to figure out what to do for next week for a week week after next All right well you can start talking about the twenty twenty cycle\nYeah Republican have Garret who is with us today\nPointed out the twenty twenty cycle starts for Republicans basically on November ... seven pm\nQuestion about it I mean with the presidential cycle and when the ... point we call the perpetual political cycle now the next day you get up and you start preparing for the next election [noise] All right he's Garrett republic\nThe presidential cycle and what the purpose of point we call the professional political cycle now the next day you get up and you start preparing for the next election\n[noise] All right Gary Republican strategist Jim Galloway you know lead report lead political writer uh Wednesdays and Sundays his column appears in the paper and of course he oversees the political insider blog at my AJC dot com\nOwners now a this bill\nOr this amendment would allow local governments to be reimbursed at rates closer to a properties current values some local governments come out winners under that methodology some would be losers so essentially it's an effort to reimburse a local government doing\nTo to to to give more more revenue flow to local governments it's it's it's it's kind of the root of this thing is the fact that this this property is valued as as forest\nAnd not as a crop right up and and and the other part of that is you have so many counties especially down in South Georgia that are that are almost nothing but never timber timber timberland the I'm\nA ... Michael the c._e._o. or a of Georgia forestry ... association says that the University of your study shows that the states working forest is taxed three times higher than in neighboring states with four point seven million acres texted rapes about six times\nHigher so this is an effort to continue to keep the taxes on the timber farmers\nAre at a\nLower rate yeah and I mean I've seen this firsthand traveling down to quote county some other places in in South Georgia where you know as far as I could say there's lonely ... and ... and his and his a full blown industry right it's not just land I mean you you really have to be more its crops\nAll right I Do think I Would urge you all if Google this one or if you because you're smart voters out there we know you are or you may want to do a little bit more research on this timber tax it and see what you're saying number four is the crime victims Rights Amendment\nIt's also known across the country have as much as it use law what is it do\nFail more Mars these law actually kind of ... and the constitution right the idea that victims have arise you already have certain noticed rice if you're a victim about hearings in court cases but in this case here for a year the victim of a crime and that individuals getting out of jail or parole or other types of motivations make sure there is in the ...\nMore cases but in this case here for a year the victim of a crime and that individuals getting out of jail or parole or other types of ages ... to make sure there was in the constitution\nThat you will get some kind of notification and can be repaired and you even have some rights to go back and ask that not happen in certain cases or seek other types of protection so emotionally at times on your heartstrings there are and it was started by an individual who was familiar with the case in another state where someone was noted by the California built billionaire\nYou're it's I'm a Tamar ... you probably will be ... been hearing about it in Washington because there are many states that are passing versions of Mars these law it all relates back to a ... Nicholas a young woman in California who was murdered\nAnd within a week after the a murder took place the family ... family walked into a store\nAnd saw the guy who'd been arrested for her killing walking free and they were stunned to have to find this out so tomorrow this is this is something this is a ... a big national campaign as Jim says funded by money from one billionaire out there\nAnd it's something that I started to pull out and catch it congressional race I think a lot of Republican actually wait actually\nBut uh but I Will tell you a bill that the ACLU heads as push back very very hard on this bill because what it's ... it's it's it's main point being that depicts victims rights\nA ... they're they're asking for the creation of a relationship between victims and the state that would directly contradict a lot of the the the the relationship between a a a an accused a traitor and the state and uh it's a it's a ...\nIf you if you talk to a lot of lawyers they're saying this is not a place you know there's this is ... and what's more it's as as you said it's a ... we have all moved a lot of this stuff is already in the statute and we're putting an end to the constitution that's a that's a bad\nYou one of the things Michael that that the critics have said is basically what what Galloway just pointed out it's that you suddenly allow the victims or the victim's family to be involved in a court proceeding you wouldn't be able to see\nThe mother of a of an assault victim and murder victim on the jury not obviously that's forbidden\nIf you wouldn't be able to see\nThe mother of a of an assault victim and murder victim on the jury not obviously that's forbidden by law the critics suggest that there are some similarity when you allow the family to enter into court proceedings and therefore become part of\nThe essentially the criminal justice system\nThat is that is part of a concern I mean it it literally spelled it out and it says you know that a writes for the victims would inclusion of any scheduled court appearance says and the opportunity to be heard any scheduled proceedings involving the release fleet or sentencing it'd be a key so it puts them right there right in the middle of it\nTomorrow or you've got to figure that the language of this amendment he's already basically said it is such\nThat there is no chance in the world isn't going to pass giving victims of ... giving the families of victims of crime rights to be involved this is why the way in which the constitutional amendment is written has a lot to do with how people perceive it right tomorrow or [laughter]\nThat's why we have programs like on the line [laughter] All right ... real quick uh the last\nOne is a an amendment number five and a the amendments kind of a gym it's pretty straightforward\nUh basically what number five says is that if you have a school district\nThat has a city school system within the county so in a DeKalb County you have the uh uh Decatur school system in ... and it basically ... it used to be that you'd have to have separate agreement but each system\nIf you're if if a if a if a lake county is seeking a school's blah staff than it has to get the permission of both the county wide school system and the ... and the than the city school system which often leaves the the kind of the uh it it gives a great deal of leverage to that smaller system\nAnd ah and I I think uh if uh if I'm not mistaken I think one of the main backers of the ... amendment was Lindsey tip ends up ... out and Mary up yet and and and he did not you know he he didn't appreciate the larger Cobb County school system being held hostage by the Marriott assist\nI Want to be careful about how we share this with our listeners have because I Believe this removes the requirement that a county systematic city school district have to agree before calling for her arrest\nI Believe this removes the requirement that a county assistant manager city school district have to agree before calling for a referendum it removes that are necessary grand ...\nThat's right right right which gave the smaller system a lot of leverage right over the larger system not just a new kind of Ghana in Marietta but also in a smaller communities all around there about twenty twenty systems lab independent city like Lori ... in Dublin in a violent and I guess maybe Gainesville and you get\nYour few others around the state that do that and so I gave them a president of leverage in a few of them abuse at times that leverage and even though they represent thirty percent of the revenue\nOf the county they might have wanted forty or fifty percent after the attacks was collected and so the larger counties you know kind of ride was there I think this will be a good when you know to support because it does now there were certain examples where they weren't getting the votes done because people were holding things up\nLike I just wanted to kind of take a step back just kind of based on some of the questions that I get about the about the whole is that the fact that you know their state wide number one right and that ah they've already gone through the house and Senate had two thirds of approval so lots of questions about that from people\nAll right uh what we're going to do we're going to take a break right now there are there are certain there are some statewide referenda on the ballots as well but that's enough for looking at these ballot issues today before election day we'll look at those couple of referenda there pretty gym there for the in the weeds\nIn the oven di di di di di\n... ... let's take a break and when we come back let's talk about some uh news that's coming out of our twenty eight feet election cycle\nBetter steak will hear anything in your car I Want you to try something roll up the windows you all sealed inside a good smell\nCan you smell that that was the great cologne experiments of two thousand for it you should not have gone with the dollar store for that one boy you can lose that older car smell my donating your vehicle one of your favorite causes like public radio it only takes a few minutes and just like that he supported the station and well you are on your way to a life\nOf better smell ... dot org slash cars and thanks\nBack to political rewind a quick clarification attempt ... told me during the break or that I got it wrong I'm always the last to learn these things ... and the lecture and hide from seven to eight we will be on television and streaming on Facebook we won't go on the radio statewide\nTonight from seven to eight we will be on television and streaming on Facebook we won't go on the radio statewide in till after eight o'clock so\nJoin it said seven GP be TV or on Facebook Live you know what I'm going to hire you have not had to get involved in too much of the business of the show yet\nWhere we're going to well let's talk about the congressional races before we talked about some updates in those make it hard on yeah let's make little for a big money she got some show tomorrow you had you filed two pieces on the sixth and seventh restrict braces\nAnd I wanted to talk about him with you and the panel first of all you just filed um to my knowledge within the last few hours of peace on the sixth district congressional race Lucy McBath\nWhy why do you know I Wonder if she wants to just really pump up the Democratic Motorola\nThere's two ... two messages they're number one go vote you know a number to\nBe very careful and make sure that vote is counted I mean this is this is you know look if if if Brian Kemp Brian Kemp closing messages is is is going to be be where the ... illegal immigrants who come to vote she's going to be there are messages going to be make sure they don't they they don't pose aside your\nYou yeah you know I think it's it's been that we've continued to say I'm and all these efforts around whether you're boats going to count or\nUm you know are you going to be a rejected or something that the thing is get out there early go vote vote provisional if you can if there's a problem we have from opportunity to to fix it but there's also the thing that you know things come up and if you wait till election day\nUm you know you you could actually have enough to your vote count but I Will tell you I get lots of calls in and you know nice old ladies will call and you know say well man this is where your polling location is and um you know you can actually go vote you know on Monday and she goes oh no\nI'm voting on election down ... so we're still going to see you know these these are devoted to our election day and so I don't I don't know that we can still even at the end of early ...\nI'm voting on election down shirt so so we're still going to see you know these these are devoted election day and so I don't I don't know that we can still even at the end of early voting you know we can look at this but know that we still have a good turnout election day you know I was just looking at the early voting returns that as of the end of business on friday\nAnd you've still got and I wondered if this was another reason that Stacey Abrams ... went to south ... mall to vote early\nYou've now got your hovering it almost a thirty percent a little under thirty percent black turnout early twenty nine point seven or so he'd love to get the number of ... that that number up by the end of the day on November ... you need to know that number needs to be thirty one thirty two\nMeanwhile uh Brian Kemp ... who's about to get go off on this big bus tour um estate he's been back in rural Georgia but he's going to launch an official or\nA fairly soon I'm not quite sure exactly when he's but it's ... yeah they get kicked off on Sunday and Monday or Georgia or in the meantime he Jim had a couple of really positive developments for him number one over the weekend the president went back on Twitter\nAnd renewed his calls for the people of Georgia\nTo vote for Brian Kemp is the best candidate for\nGovernor and uh that certainly helped Brian in the in the runoff but then the\nHere's the I think and you'll tell me about this gym the even bigger widen it was this commercial\nThis election is about Georgia's future\nWe can't afford billions in big government with higher taxes Brian camp is\nThe only candidate who will keep Georgia moving fall\nOn as a businessman who will grow our economy and create jobs mind best thing in education\nBrian will keep Georgia safe strong I'm Nathan Deal Ryan camp we'll keep Georgia moving in the right direction\nGym it's nice to have the president but in Georgia haven't Nathan Deal special\nEffects that are that supporting and you'll notice that the the ... the commercial was very non specific it was it was a very very valuable to let the governor say what he wanted to exactly what he wanted to say there\nThis is if you are a Democrat in Georgia this is where the vice starts to tighten the less for it and we're in the last two weeks and here we are and and now the full weight of Republican influenced begins\nIt starts to tighten the last word in the war in the last two weeks\nAnd here we are and and know the full weight of Republican influenced begins to kind of come down on your campaign or a gift we saw Trump entered the race over the weekend I mean but eight years ago it was it was George W or maybe a little bit more than\nA laws on ten years and years ago it was it was and it was George W uh uh this is this is how we talk about this period when when the when the when the Republican base comes home and we were at the front door that period ...\nTo ... let me let me just a pick up on some Big Jim said though I mean I I get the you know Trump's popularity according to be a juicy polling and and it may have changed since the last poll which is we can blue more than a week plus ago\nA hovering right around fifty percent I Would argue that ah that in many ways Nathan Deal who is enormously popular\nA is a bigger endorsement grade now than Donald Trump\nGala in all of our own land there last year at ... ... ... ... ... ... like in in charge at worst at it and try and more so than\nAny ... or any any other kind of a special talent that definitely will at the same time a Republican that\nThey're not wanting to kind of ... and I think that that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation really galvanized and I I think there still is quite a bit of trouble ... over the next two weeks chicken finger\nMichael a Stacey Abrams has made a point over and over again of saying that ... and ... because obviously she gets how popular Nathan Deal is with Republicans and Democrats\nI'm saying how she worked with Nathan Deal and the legislature especially on criminal justice reporter a reform does this take any of the wind out of her sales in trying to argue that she really is the un herder of the deal legacy in some ways\nI don't think so I mean there is no surprise at the end of the day\nYou know Republican governors going to come out and endorse the Republican nominee so there there is no surprise there but Abrams has been consistent what she says how she's been able to work across the aisle and our campaign is is basically out there for all Georgia's you know so um I I don't see a surprise\nTo tell you what do they have if you tell me the one thing that I that looking at that\nIt's basically out there for all Georgia's you know so um I I don't see a surprise\nTo tell you what they have if you tell me the one thing that I ... looking at that at and listening to a just a few minutes ago the softness of that ad ah makes me feel that it's directed at\nWomen voters shows no question right that this is first of all bill you're right it was a powerful one two punch\nNobody can motivate based Republican voters in the state of Georgia better than Donald Trump when it comes to tweets and getting stuff out for the base\nAnd we know that the Democrats are organized and coming to vote and historic numbers already so that was important but Nathan Deal I Do think is probably the lynchpin of the campaign because that ad goes right to is independent women and independent men a gym you know we forget there are a lot of independent voter men\nAnd Nathan Deal is speaking right to both independent men and independent women there are Nathan Deal Democrat still out there in the state of Georgia and they like him you know the state it's clear and all polling that most the majority of Georgia's St George's going in the right direction\nAnd I think that's why you have the added that line Brian Campbell keep us going in the right direction is a nice\nVery not so subtle hand off from a ... one person to the next and it helps smooth over any of the rough edges to some people think Brian Kemp still has\nI don't and I don't think we should uh a failed to mention gym that a new deal was he was reluctant to jump into he certainly didn't want to jump in on behalf of Casey giggle he was on the stage with Brian camp in a big Republican rally the night or two after a camp won the runoff\nBut he's been relatively quiet so far in this campaign\nDo I mean the the higher politics he got caught up in the higher politics so he came out and endorsed K goal I think a\nWith a with a with a visit is does it make me kind of a fair and ah and then he was he was immediately big footed by the Purdue cousins who who who were able to bring Trump\nYeah All right let's do this let's get another break out of the way because when we come back Brian Kemp a in an op ed piece that he wrote in the Sunday Atlanta Journal constitution made a claim that um I think deserves our attention and scrutiny you are listening to political rewind\nAnd the next ... Melissa McCarthy\nNever have their\nKind of the stars and the new film can you ever forgive me by August\nMy house in Iran\nThat kind of the stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as it biographer tank literary for a chair and we'll talk about the film growing up on a farm or early comedy act parole and bridesmaids and playing Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live joining\nFresh air is this afternoon at three D.
