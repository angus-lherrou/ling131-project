[noise]\nI Want to start very briefly by saying I'm I don't like to talk personally is too often on the show but um I Will tell you that I'm I'm Jewish\nI don't like to talk personally is too often on the show but um I Will tell you that I'm\nI'm Jewish my wife and kids are Jewish and this has been a very rough couple of days in our family has it has been for Jewish families across the country and uh and really we don't have to be Jewish too have had a very difficult time\nFor the last couple of days I'm In the same way that you didn't have to be African American but you felt more than others after the mother Emanuel church massacre\nHum or anytime any Muslim was dealt with a violent to hate crime in their community\nAnd so we're going to start the show today by talking a bit about hatred in America\nAnd how we can look had getting past this awful awful time\nIn our lives are so I Know it's not that we're not talking about campaign politics at the very top of the show we will get to that because the election is going to go on and uh we need to talk about what's happening in the final week of the election cycle\nBut let's get started by talking a bit about what happened in Pittsburgh on Saturday um we've got a a course Jim Galloway here the lead political rip ... or a writer for the AJC\nJim ... thank you for being you hear you and I traded messages on Saturday and I and I appreciated the fact that you were aware of what a difficult day it was especially for Jewish Americans\nRight and and and anyone with a sense of history I'm going to be upset and will will will come into the the the Atlanta's experience this with with the temple bombing a been a bit we'll\nDo that during the show as well Jim course appears in the Wednesday and Sunday newspaper and oversees the political insider blog\nAt politically Georgia my AJC dot com right across from him in the studio tag dream a Republican\nStrategist who's got a couple of candidates in this election cycle and um who's spending all last week thinking about that we're glad you're here today to I'd always a pleasure thanks bill and Howard Franklin democratic political strategist is here as Well hi Howard afternoon guys\nSo let's talk a little gym um [noise] with his ... oh I didn't introduce it Allison ... see this is why Galloway is a great a side man here\nOh I introduce Allison could be a good mood see this is why Galloway is a great ... side man here\nAllison ... Goodman is the southeast regional director of the Anti Defamation league and Ellis who were very glad you're here even though I didn't introduce the very start fell\nYeah we're not seeing a twenty Seventeen we did not see a number of violent assault against is what we saw a huge spike in the number of incidents around harassment in vandalism these types of kind of everyday easier actions that people can take\nThat maybe don't take that extra step into violence to Saturday with ...\nThe euro erode every a lot and every has for a long long time been ground zero for a lot of this very kind of behavior there's a strong Jewish presence on the campus\nBut over the years there have been people who have targeted that Jewish student body with the kind of things Allison is talking about swastikas anti Jewish messaging so it's something you're pretty aware of I think that\nThat's true and I want to I Want to look back to something you were hearing earlier about it was either you or Jim I Can't recall I'm about there being as you know the ... the adult in the room where the father figure talking us through this I had that experience on on Sunday um but\nI don't necessarily think that the government is the only place to look for moral leadership I agree with when we heard Don are I'm giving moving a prayer coming out of retirement and peach tree road United Methodist church and that's where I look for for moral leadership um\nThe hyper partisanship that that uh Howard mentioned this is something that is not just\nSince two thousand sixteen it had been it had been brewing for a number of years I'm not saying it's President Obama's fault I'm not saying is President Trump's fault I'm saying it's something that has built up over at least a decade and we have all all\nUs as political actors whether we're just a normal voters or whether\nI'm saying it's something that has built up over at least a decade and we have all all of us as political actors whether we're just a normal voters or whether we are consultants who may get carried away with this guy used\nUm of what of what the people on the streets are talking about we've all contributed to that um and we can all be part of changing that but [noise]\nWhen Jim talks about political correctness as a set of sort of genteel rules under which we have our civic debate I think that was true at one point\nI think at some point in the nineties and accelerating through uh the last decade the idea of political correctness and that there are words you can say there are sentiments you can't harbor inside your brain is even if not acted upon has become a casualty to use against\nPeople who believe differently um and again that's not just a right wing\nA phenomenon that's not just a left wing phenomenon it's something that a lot of people have done it becomes easier to do it publicly now because you can do it publicly from behind is a small screen or ah or behind a larger screen at your desk [laughter] um\nBut we've all contributed to it every time that we don't say\nI'm not comfortable with that [noise] I don't I don't want to eat you can't say that in front of me\nSo I'm I Want to read you said we have to look for a leaders who are outside of government I think that's right um red blue students rabbi posted it or or wrote a note is that a Greg put out on Twitter and I read tweeted on the politics gp based sites\nAnd here's what his rabbi said are people who have been targets of attack for millennia way of so many ways to protect ourselves or fight back we will continue to do so\nUltimately our greatest response to those who seek to hate or destroy us and our greatest victory over them has been refused to submit to fear but rather to continue to live to learn to pray\nAnd to sustain our heritage that has a response that is within the grasp of each of us today Allison your thoughts on what you what he said\nYeah I mean we we do need to kind of come together around this and I should say\nWe have been really I'm blessed to have so many outpouring of solidarity from all communities in Atlanta um we've gotten beautiful messages from I'm from several churches from the Islamic speakers bureau\nFrom Planned Parenthood from issues based groups but you know political ...\nI'm from several churches from the Islamic speakers bureau from Planned Parenthood from issues based groups and you know political non political um community members passed interns people are just showing up right now and that's exactly what they need to be doing\nIf I could if I could jump in and just kind of respond to what Tom was saying is ... ... you know we we we have a government isn't the only source of leadership that we could put it that\nThat uh again it's not the only source of leadership that we need right now certainly but we're we're living in a society that is more and more secular\nOr in a society in which really religious leadership quite frankly carries less and less weight within a community\nAnd to me that makes it more important\nFor for for political figures across the spectrum I mean you know I Want to hear from Nathan Deal I Wanna see Nathan Deal in the ... but talking about this I Want to see Johnny Isaacson\nPulled but talking about this I Want to see David Perdue I Want to I Want you know I Want I wanted to see of a of a Michael Thurman\nYeah I think that's a good point and and Howard uh we we have to get these ... I Do think there is some synagogues who they are now planning their services to to remember what happened over the weekend so ... there's time for these leaders the gyms to argue about to step forward but they ought to yeah\nI totally agree I I went to Charleston\nAfter the massacre there a couple of years ago and a broad\nUm array of leaders who saw fit to weigh in on this tragedy and in weighing on the troubled mind that was able to conceive killing people in a church I think it was useful to the discourse I I don't I wouldn't\nOn this show promote any sort of false equivalence I Do want to talk more about kind of ... on the\nAll of us having a responsibility in a row for because I think there's also the the prominence of backlash from people do speak out right after it it's such a\n... it's such a chicken and egg question as such a you know a ... kind of a revolving we'll because I I Do think there are plenty of people leaders organizations who do try to speak out on that and sometimes they get\nLabeled as the political correctness police or you know other things also maybe ... maybe thrown at them so I'm really curious I think this is a difficult thorny question to answer especially when you include the layer of politics and we're gonna go head to head\nMaybe thrown at them so I'm really curious I think this is a difficult and a thorny question to answer especially when you include the layer of politics and we're going to go ahead of\nTime I was going to say that to gyms point that the the problem when lifting up our secular leaders as\nMoral authorities in some way is that you eventually get to one who disagrees with you and it is only accountable to a better majority in electoral college and and and so by by saying that we're going to look to the political leadership\nFor a moral guidance you're you're empowering the next guy whom you may not agree with that\nI hear that accept ... that's exactly what you're Trump does he plays to his base and his base alone so he will never be able to be a great unite or because his messaging is always to the people who supported him and you know that um [noise]\nAnd and part of the issue is strikes me there ... look we've all accepted for some time now that it just isn't in his DNA\nTo be a healer and a great moral or a leader who can bring us together as a people round Reagan knew how to do it after challenger so Peggy Noonan speech which he wrote for him and he delivered so beautifully and it was such feeling was an example of that it had nothing to do with [noise]\nYou know kids playing to his base you know he talked about the astronauts who were killed and challenger going off to touch the face of God\nI mean powerful ... Obama after Sandy Hook I think ... point is correct so the trade off I Believe you get with President Trump is for those who are supporters of his is\nFor going to get our Supreme Court justices were going to get our conservative agenda [noise] okay so he's not going to be the unite or we accept that but but\nBut I Would say that that when you when you say that Reagan speech the magic of that speech was not just that it was delivered by of by a very fine actor or than it was written by one of the preeminent words ... of of our lifetime it's that you referred to eternal um\nMoral standard right highway and an aunt and and that is something that has been I Would argue drummed out of much of our of our severe\nI I'm Alison I Want to I'm not an frankly you know one of the things we know about the Anti Defamation league as you are not a partisan organization and so to some extent I\nI Would I Want to earn frankly you know one of the things we know about you have to I'd ever major league as you are not a partisan organization so to some extent I I kind of water walls you off what is going to become more partisan conversation after we finish your segment with you so let's come back to you I'm\nA deal marks all of these things you can monitor them how do you fight back you up programs like no place for what are you doing to try to change for climate it deal\nSure so we are engaging people and dialogue and discussion about difference and identity and how to stand up to bigotry and hate at all levels\nEvery single day and with a number of different types of constituents so no place for hate we work in over two hundred schools in the region but thousands nationwide where touching millions of students across the country and teaching them how to speak up against hate when they see it happen\nUm we have a really great resource on line about a power empowering young people in the aftermath of hate that's actually for educators students are parents\nAnd so you know there is a difference between journalism and the journalistic entertainment right ...\nGrant you that the gym where the reason that there are such anger and hatred in this country ... I'll tell you there are two two things that bothered me number one it was a ... that you read it in that there's an implied bargain there [noise]\nYou start saying nice things about me the president was saying and ... and things will come down down to the hatred will stuff [noise]\nUh you know you do one you get the other [noise] um [noise] I'm not sure number one that he's in control of that uh and uh so uh so I'm not sure that it is that it's something that we can even if it we can even entertained I Will tell you what the you know the the the tweet to bother me most\nUh on on Saturday from the president was a his decision to discuss uh the the pitching shortcomings of the ... hours yes uh I mean just [noise] uh yeah I mean they should not have pulled their starting pitching\nPitching shortcomings of the elite down ... as a I mean just\nUh yeah I mean you either doubt that they should not have pulled their starting pitcher for reliever you're you're you're you're\nIn in one tweet you are trying to trying to at least making an attempt to convey some sympathy and empathy about what's happened in Pittsburgh and then you're off to the world series\nI think the the really ironic part of his entire display that you've got a guy who\nActually became a public figure by being an entertainer on television and now he is complaining that he's not being taken seriously although he does so many you know cartoonish things whether it's on Twitter or behind\nThe podium for a political rally not I don't I'm not saying that the person doesn't have the right but I but I think in any of it\nAs a member of either party you have to realize at the statements you're making has some consequences people have the ability to weigh in and they give you and the and the broader public what they believed to be a ... the substance or lack there of when you're behind that Mike from\nSo uh in talking about how the president has dealt with this weekend a for good and ill or I was thinking about Jim ... one of the worst act of terrorism in the United states which took place here\nBy it and I'm putting that in a historical perspective at that time it was one of the worst acts of terrorism uh in October of Nineteen fifty eight\nHebrew benevolent association the temple one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the state of Georgia I'm was bombed\nAt three in the mornings uh some I think there were like twenty pounds or something that if the fifty six fifty six of dynamite of blew off the side of the building thank God no one was killed but it shocked\nThe Atlantic community at the time be cause it was such an overt uh and raging sign of hatred against juice\nAnd it was ... you know I mean this is if if you're if you're if you're a movie buff this is what's driving ... it was about to actually\nWrite days he is coming to temple to come to a surface and they pull up and stop people remember the scene and and uh hulk the driver says we we can go in there as a mom [noise] um\nBut uh but but it did two things that were two things have to come out and then bombing number one is I mean it was all a rabbi rough\nAnd um [noise] um but uh but uh but it did two things that were two things have to come out and bought me number one is I mean it was all a rabbi Rothschild who's leaving the congregation at the time I mean he was already making a mark\nFor himself as as a as a proponent of desegregation ah which which in essence made made the temple a target there [noise]\nUh so it it it it kind of illustrated the union of causes between between religious freedom and and racial justice yeah and and\nLet me let me just play for a minute I'm\nSome sound of from ... morning October twelfth fucked over twelve Nineteen fifty eight mayor William Hartsfield went immediately to the temple he grabbed a W. S. B. T. V. microphone and talked into their film camera and said this\nSo that was a mayor William Hartsfield of Atlanta attempt house just told me that it's crossed wires that President Trump is heading to Pittsburgh tomorrow a bill Hartsfield wouldn't be a bad model for him for how to deal in the aftermath of this sort of thing Todd [noise] I\nI I agree with that I think that um [noise] I think that there is a there is a place for for measured um statements like that but again I I just I just don't [noise]\nI I just don't pay that much attention to Washington I don't pay that much attention to Twitter really the the last time I think I looked at Twitter on my cell phone was probably the last time I was here [noise]\nUm and and that's part of the discretion that that I advocate is when people are ... has turned a medium into assessed pit well get out of it quits quit swimming in it ah it's done wonders for my peace of mind\nNeal if I could ... it just in fifty eight when when Hartsfield said that he wasn't talking I mean he wasn't reacting to to just a little little tidbits of social media he wasn't responding to to Twitter messages he was he was responding to it\nPlease tell them to media I guess my concern is just that\nPeople aren't leaving it right it it's obviously got all sorts of issues we talk about and we've seen in a in the news you know leaders who have said things that have got booted from social media et cetera but it doesn't seem like the millions if not billions of people who are still using it to get their news are using it to spread their views are stepping back from the microphone away from their computers\nBut I Can't control what they do I I can only control what what I Do and I can only control what I suggest other folks do\n[noise] um I I Would say to to gyms point about the chronology we were also it was also several years before a Lester Maddox was\nA rise to prominence so it was it wasn't just like a stopping point and now George is on the right track but I I think there is some level at which ah Hartsfield had been dealing with\nThe underlying tensions and and I think that that\nAt that time the the racial issue was probably the greatest the greater of the\nOf well in fact the great rabbi ... ... or Jake abrupt child who was a great hero it in a civil rights leader in this town was also the guy who had and Martin Luther king junior won the Nobel Peace prize and the rest of Atlanta the the business community turned their back on him it was Jacob Rothschild his wife Julie nice\nUh the Coca Cola company that came forward forward and said we're going to honor this man this is an extraordinary achievement and that to Howard was a turning point in the business community's relationship\nTo the African American community\nAbsolutely I mean that a storied us the story a narrow narrative a retelling and I mean I I\nAm a ... eleven we went to Israel or in many ways and when I was reminded of all of the partnership that have grown from oppression and frankly an forever from having each other's backs and", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "29"}
