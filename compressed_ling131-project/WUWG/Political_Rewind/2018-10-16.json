Michael ... of course the\nChairman of the Democratic party of a Cobb County and I were awfully glad to have you here as well Michael I'm happy to be here and get early voting started well that's what I really want to get our ... kick our conversation off with Jim so there's been one full day of early voting\nAnd anecdotal uh reports suggest that precincts have had big turnout people seem to really be invested in this race\nWe've got a two hour waiting income county is is what what I understand we've got enough pressure up in North folding Johns creek area that they've had some technical issues uh uh to address there\nIs is what what I understand we've got enough pressure up in North folding Johns creek area that they've had some technical issues uh uh to address their uh and and I think but before we went on air you know we we gotta we sampled the crowd here and they they they they ran into into the same enthusiasm\nI Want to go back to that county for just a second I'm and I want to talk to you about this Michael sharing Gonzalez who of course has been a Hispanic leader here for many years uh he works he's at the George association of Latino elected officials\nJerry said that we should be ... Democrats should be really worried about what happened in ... county\nBecause he wonders if this is an effort to suppress democratic votes which plays into a scenario that's becoming a big big topic of conversation in this election we're going to talk about that in a minute but\nDo you really see anything you haven't looked equal that county specifically but no\nHaven't but I I I Know Jerry's or find individual player does fine outstanding work so if if if Jerry said something there's there's some truth there behind it um but I think it's worth looking at I think it's something we should continue to as as Jim said early those numbers seem\nFar beyond just anomalies so I'm whiskey doing it's we if we start seeing that in other areas in other places and other counties than a ... and we may start\nI think it also has a lot to do with the effectiveness of the New Georgia project in\nThe state theaters Abrams project she's no longer the direct right here but um that program has been very effective in registering people and there's a bunch of pending registrations out there but to do that to have that much more in that that great of an increase in registrations\nYou're probably are going to see I also see some things that I haven't been done cleanly and and they are required any form filled out must be turned in even if there were mistakes on it\nAll right well this leads us to talk for a few minutes at least about this issue these two issues that have popped up in the really they've been they've been building but in in this past weekend and certainly moving in the beginning of this week uh there are two narratives that have taken shape\nOne of them is the ongoing campaign that the Abrams folks in the Georgia Democratic Party has waged a talking about voter suppression all of the ... ways they think that Brian\nAbrams folks and the Georgia Democratic Party has waged\nA talking about voter suppression all of the ... ways they think that Brian Kemp secretary of state's office has been trying to suppress a democratic votes the most recent being the fifty three thousand people who\nBeen who who are well let's be careful there these are people who\nWere put out a list of a possible voter because of exactly match writing what ...\nWas um it was a law and put in place of basically says that you're in a strange and has to match exactly exactly exactly right um so there are some potential problems within explained before is that\nUm when you look at particularly in communities of color you are going to see more names that are hyphenated have a ... she ... views have accidents sphere so when you look at it but fortunately it is going to affect the minority population at a higher rates\nThat they say you were in the legislature were you not when exact match so it's just it's just a statutory provision right\nIt is and it was if I recall correctly I think a exact\nParty line vote against that legislation um because it it has the effect that um that Michael was just mentioning you have nontraditional spellings also more likely in minority communities and that's going to lead to mistakes just but not by um malice but just by clerical error data entry errors and the fact\nTo think about data entry airs clerical errors keeping people from voting on it very frustrating and I and I do think it's important and and I and I think you are starting to do this we we do want folks to know that if you're in this group of fifty three thousand you will be able to cast a vote if you bring an ID and and it is very important that that folks know down and Stacey Abrams has been adamant\nEvery time she spoken on this issue\nThat I've heard where she said yes you can vote because we want to make sure that folks don't get don't get discouraged and I think some of the national media outlets have have confused the the the story a little bit you will be able to vote\nSo go and vote don't be discouraged but this is clearly something that I Hope the next legislature will work to repeal\nWere well just to declare the exact batch is that your voter registration form must exactly match her driver's license or your Social Security those are the two a\nBarometer is by which to match against and I'm Stacey point you can all of these fifty three thousand people are eligible voters they um just have to bring the proper form of id and can vote and it's my understanding that if it's not a proper form of id\nTwo thousand people are eligible voters they um just have to bring the proper form of id and can vote and it's my understanding that it's not a proper form of id or doesn't match exactly they can still cast a provisional ballot\nWhich happens that to happen and I'm very glad that context I found very concerned about it because I think that the idea that there's this aggressive effort to suppress rose in a way can backfire on the very people who were trying to help you and careful from you\nBelieve that exact match is in and say see having things which are strict party line vote is a Republican effort to suppress democratic quotes\nI think the well I don't think it's a Republican effort to to to pro okay and I said I was what I thought I don't really use the term that mess that term is\nMore used by Democrats and Republicans use terms like voter integrity and vote identification check that kind of thing that matters really not been part of the legislation I don't think it was mentioned is that the words is that match ... mentioned in legislation\nThat it is the fact and and you can ... there's something about things by the same name [laughter] doesn't really matter of fact it is certainly potential depression ... on the way you\nWant to jump in you know a a couple of ... I spent most of most of today when I was not on air of going back through the through the uh the debate the it was a February or early February twenty Seventeen debate\nOr the legislator the legislature and and and and and and Democrats were very careful about us spelling out the hazards because this is this is already been litigated in fact something like nine days before is this the the house took this up in the past it\nUh Brian Kemp had settled with these a voter registration registration groups\nAnd this legislation was designed specifically designed to overturn the settlement uh we have in our audience a state representative Brenda Lopez she was one of the people who spoke against it making the point that you know if you had if a if a if a data entry person accidently put two spaces\nBetween a surname and and and your family name\nThan you do when you were done for a and the problem with this is that for voters are notified what the problem is and yet they're being asked to fix it\nWe've got to get it says in the weeds I Love having a real audience here at it this is the people are giving me a thumbs up I'm Glad to hear that thank you I Want to take this up\nRight I we got to get ... is this in the weeds I Love having a real audience here at it this is no people are giving me the thumbs up I'm Glad to hear that thank you I Want to take this up as a campaign issue and then look at the other campaign issue that's getting a lot of attention I and that's a Brian Kemp\nAre suggesting that Stacey Abrams has made it clear she wants undocumented residents in Georgia to vote illegally we'll talk about that in a lot more you're listening to political rewind with our live audience in our studios in Atlanta [noise] [noise]\nFor the first time high school girls will get a chance to play a season of football the Atlanta Falcons are sponsoring get an old girl flag football league in Georgia schools we\nAlways tell our kids the sky's the limit but then we put limits on them when girls can't play football so I think that the kids\nFind out how this leak is about more than the game on all things considered this afternoon four to seven PM CPB news than what the fact\n\nWelcome back to political rewind or as I said we're coming to you from studio be of Georgia Public broadcasting recording our show in front of a a live audience and political rewind a listeners um [noise]\nLet time why don't we uh uh play\nThe sound bite a first of all let's play the sound bite of Stacey Abrams on meet the press she made the rounds of the national shows on Sunday a CNN or NBC she was on a but both of them there's a big political shows\nAnd she went after the is a so called voter suppression issue let's listen to what she said\nWe know fought system that has a disproportionate effect on people of color but it also has the ability to erode trust and our system I know that\nSecretary can't is well aware of it and it's part of the pattern of behavior where he tries to tell the playing field in his favor or in favor of his party ... should not require the ... and the public\nAll right so there Stacey Abrams dating her case this is she says voter suppression campus aware of it he's doing it intentionally uh Brian Kim a has responded to that let's listen to what camp pet to say I think this was on Fox News on Monday morning\nThat's a smoke screen trying to hide her radical views those folks that are on the painting list all they have to do is go to the polls show their photo ID and like\nBoth screen trying to hide her radical views those folks that are on the painting list all they have to do is go to the polls show their photo ID and they can vote\nAgain this is just a distraction from her view of our groups filed the lawsuit to get non citizens to vote in a state of Georgia we're not going to allow that we're gonna have secure accessible and fair elections in our state and by the way they're not talking about the fact that we have more registered voters on our roles now than we've ever had\nAnd she voted against phone line voter registration that helped create this improved our voter rolls and has more people participating in the process so we're very proud of that\nAll right so there was a lot to unpack especially in was a a camp Joe said but let's start with the most basic uh effort her response or his response for two Abrams attack is it's a smokescreen to hide her radical politics and of course her radical politics is a big theme\nYou you weren't going to be held accountable as a governor as a president as a member of Congress for how quickly and well the government responds to your concerns so it's ... you you've got to be successful if your part of the Republican a team on the on the ticket\nYou've got to work this has got to be done successfully that's what I'm Talking about with a rally\nTo file and in our hearts certainly go out to those that are affected by the storm and and that's that's real life that's going on down there real law and and it's heartbreaking so we're glad\nThat the president is down here and and shining um the resources of the federal government that light on the state now politically talking about it just the raw political terms I think camp in the winter on this because um it brings Trump to Georgia\nOn it brings Trump to Georgia in a way where he's president like doing good for the state and it's going to be a positive a positive light for the president and\nThen he has a tail and rally where he might be criticized as much as praise\nIt might save it might save or it might save Georgia from that visit from that political rally visit but still you have a sort of a warm and fuzzy feeling if you're a Trump supporter that he came here and you get the benefit of Trump being here but not the potential political downfall of him going off script\nOK hasn't left yet [laughter]\nTrump being here but not the potential political downfall and going off script okay he hasn't left yet [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nAll right let's take up another issue I have to do this kind of quickly I'm\nUp in the six ... congressional district a Karen Handel the incumbent is in a race against Lucy McBath that of course we all know by now the Lucy McBath is a ... a woman who really got engaged in politics Michael I'm going to come to you first 'cause your district if you're caught county as part of that district um\nShe got engaged because her son tragically was was killed by a gun Ina Garten incident\nUm she's seems to be behind she's raising money\nBut uh Michael Bloomberg with his uh I'm gun safety organization every town for gun safety he put a million plus dollars into her campaign initially and now we learn that he's come back and put another million eight\nInto her campaign\nIs that a sign that he thinks McBath can win or that\nHe's doing everything he can too because she's behind Denny's worried that she can't\nNo I I think it's a strong indicator that um that she has an opportunity to win this race you know I mean I I\nAlso started the sixth district task force when we actually you know put specific effort into the ... D triple C has kind of came of all the more important I think that saying that\nUm she raised almost made of her own on this past cycle and that was through twenty almost twenty eight thousand individual small donors that doesn't happen without ... that that way we talk about it doesn't happen without that so I think looking at that how much money she was able to raise just individually um outside of what where every town is done I think is really what's telling storage him\nA just a quick question from Michael well what she's showing in cash on him because Karen Handel announced today that she's got nearly a million dollars ready to spend about nine hundred and Seventy three thousand\nI can be wrong but I think it's around seven hundred thousand or so they can be a relatively haven't yet but that's before the infusion apparently the million aid from the Bloomberg grew crimes\nSooner but ... you know some of them were like of ... in in in superPAC\nMy we should point out uh most of the prognosticators the data crunchers continue to keep that race as a Republican a victory so we'll watch how it plays out\nWell we don't we don't know how many of the small ... square in fate or out of state and that makes a difference because if they were\nThe Republican victory so we'll watch out what plays out well we don't\nWe don't know how many of those small donors were in state or out of state and that makes a difference because if they were in state then that aligns with voters\nIf they if the if those donations were coming from out of state and those folks aren't voting they're merely sending in um contributions and we've seen across the country so that's kind of mirrors what's going on across the country if we look for example that\nTed Cruz's race probably the most glaring example of what the ... of this phenomenon this cycle as we paid or Rourke who is challenging the un dollar raise a forty million dollars yet he's trailing significantly in the polls\nAnd so you know I think that while there's a lot of money flowing into some of these democratic racist that doesn't mean\nI'm that those candidates are sitting in a good position\nTo notice also that's ... that's right and also because you know everyone knows that Michael Bloomberg just kicking the tires on running for president so this gift you could be more about Bloomberg is spreading his own message for his own campaign or gender of just like a diversion joined Rogers who Democrat [laughter] well well Bloomberg\nHas a lot of a congressional races he can plan if he wants to build up relationships for a twenty twenty and he has an interest in backing people that are going to win I don't think he's going to throw a good money after bad\nHe's he's put money in this race because he believes at least you can win and the ... she can win too she's only about two points back and the energy on her side of the amazing she almost out she outraged Karen Handel almost by double\nThis last cycle and does dollars spent\nUm and I think for a Karen Handel or any of the Republicans to talk about potentially on outside money um or or out of state donations to lose the is a little disingenuous because Karen Handel is in a position she's in she's in the U.S Senate because of do\nThey in pouring of money from out of state donors in her special election in twenty Seventeen you got there because of ...\nI got to go to the break 'em so we'll do that\nA political ...\n[noise]\nOn the next fresh air growing up with an absent mother who was addicted to heroin and raised by

eighty eight point fine\n[noise] welcome\nBack through political rewind we are in Studio be of Georgia Public broadcasting with a live audience watching us record this show which you're all hearing right now I Know Tuesday Afternoon I I said I wanted to give the audience a chance to ask questions so let me start with you tell us your name and then ask your question\nI'm In a while and and the judge educator I had a question if we think if I was in dollars that uh Brian Kemp has promised to Georgia teachers do you think that that specifically for public school teachers are also private\nAnd where will this money come from and also on who seems to have a discussion of who seems to have the better plans for the title in schools ... the ones that are more than fifty percent free and reduced lunch\nGreat question a gym you can I answer the question first of all about five thousand dollar is where where where would have come on what was the price tag on that thirty thirty million dollars already recovered eternity thirty million dollars he says that would come from it will come from the general budget and what it\nWould come from the general budget been one fashion or another uh what's interesting about that is\nThat it got uh some rave reviews among many Republicans\nHouse speaker David Rosen was not one of them have any control of the groups the controls the purse strings\nYeah you kind of got to get a speaker on your sides you know what's interesting about that it strikes me that was a big thing when it first was now he really bug or caused a splash and with all the everything else has been going on I'm sure he'll still come back to it but it's kind of faded into the background\nA little ... bill right if I could just one thing that's really interesting getting up and and the less because of three or four days is that a Abrams has come up with the minimum wage for law enforcement which can put opposes right so you've got some really ... you got some difference on these candidate\nIs that part is that a pay raise still going to be big deal for\nThe teacher pay rate I guess I mean I think so I think um we happened to your first question we haven't heard much about it because there had been a lot of other issues um transpiring since then\nBut I'm sure we're going to hear a lot about it during the debates when those occur and I think to answer your question [noise] um you know when governors they have discretion and how they put together their budget um it'll be difficult for Brian Kemp and the first year because uh if he is elected\nUm you know when governor is they have discretion and how they put together their budget um it'll be difficult for Brian kept in the first year because uh if he is elected 'em because typically the previous governor is kind of setting that agenda and then you're tweaking it when you come in and your first term\nUm but they have discretion on how they prioritize those budgets and working with the various departments and so that's how that would happen it would have to come from somewhere else um but we also have some new revenue streams coming into the state in terms of the\nInternet sales tax and um and some up due to some of the tax reforms at the federal level\nThe first question was about whether it's just for public school teachers or not I have a school specifically\nWith the ah the fifty three thousand of voters cause any does anybody know the number of white males since they have the standardized names and don't have to change them for any reason I don't think anybody knows\nThat there's you know I saw the lists um the gentleman who's been the lead investigator on this interview me back in twenty Thirteen or with the same list um and and and so he was making decisions on whether or not the person was African American or Latino based purely on name and\nAnd not you know and and you know Ron Brown must be a black person I mean he was actually doing that as you interviewed me for two hours slap 'em I\nThink I think the the the general estimate has been a Seventy percent African American once you throw throw in Asians and Hispanics who jumps to to eighty percent which means twenty percent white voters I don't know if there's a gender or what the gender break down there is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Carrollton", "day":
