there you go Julian times it is going to be joining us a little later in the show 'cause we are going to talk about early voting that I'm particularly interested in her she's up there in ... county interested in what the early voting data tells us about how women\nAre turning out and what they're what they might be doing as they cast their ballots All right let's get right to it um [noise]\nI said that there was some breaking news part of it is the special session that you just heard a drew doesn't tell you about on the news break\nI'm Kevin the governor has called this special session he just couldn't deal with the uh figuring out how to budget for the call\nI'm Kevin the governor has called this special session he just couldn't deal with the uh figuring out how to budget for the costs of clean up for Michael they're talking about at least a hundred million dollar Seventy million of that might just be\nWhile I think it uh that's in part and quite frankly I think one ... had several other issues in the shower and beat his well his taking on all the teachers they felt unfairly so his redistricting which was rather ham handed\nSome of the other things got him into trouble as well as the flag issue the fact of the matter is that that we have moved on and what makes the flag different from some of these other issues that we've been talking about some of some deals with history a and looking back\nA ... but but the flag in particular or as was pointed out by a by you're a person on Facebook that was something that was brought forward from the civil war into our modern times\nAnd and used as a symbol of ... of segregation Hazaras brown v board of education and other things and so that they are in lots of different we can have a debate as to what statue should remain and what's that you should not personally believe that the Stone Mountain\nA carving should stay on their up something like the flag which has been used in modern times uh to uh to call for repression and racism that's something that we need them off into the history\nSo we're going to see tonight whether the camp people think this is an issue that voters may have to be interested in and see how they bring it up I have a pretty ... and\nI have a production I think they'll try to connected to this effort to make her seem radical outsider and where is the one way I Do watch what flag she burn it's that's the idea she would do something\nOkay effect find um meanwhile uh just about an hour I think before we went on the air today we are so story that broke in Rolling Stone it'll make its way into the AJC if it hasn't already become part of the political insider Kevin uh Brian Kemp captured on tape audiotape\nIn a private Republican gathering presumably of his own\nAnd part of the ... a political insider Kevin uh Brian Kemp captured on tape audiotape\nIn a private Republican gathering presumably of his own supporters and um we've already talked to a campus campaign about this the spokesman there are a it doesn't take issue with the ... camp says on the tape\nOr he just says he can't be sure camp didn't say more because there weren't a lot of campaign people in the room so this is what camp said in talking in a private setting according to Rolling Stone\nAbout all of the early voting efforts that are going on in the absentee efforts that were going on let's listen to that tape\nAs far as we were going to start early voting was\nLiterally tens of millions of dollars they are behind you get out there they allowed out of that law has\nA camera that was\nHer by less than the one hand the vowels outlaw that\n[noise] so at Lindsay what became campaign says yeah he's telling his supporters the Democrats are energized they're getting a lot of early voters how they've got a lot of absentee votes now we have to do as good a job as they do and they say it's as simple as that\nI think it is a simple as that uh and I would totally expect a Stacey Abrams to be standing up and and whether it be a closed meeting or doping meeting with the press and say you know those Republicans they are are showing up and those Republican areas are and we got to get our people out\nTo eat in the context that we have right now\nWhere there are Democrats accusing the secretary of state's office voter suppression effort where just this afternoon the ACLU was in a federal court arguing that a lot more than fifty thousand or early votes\n... Vance votes were cast were challenged in are in a provisional status now because the signatures didn't match\nThere are people out there who believe there's been an active voter suppression effort\nAnd his doesn't help because of the Republicans who want to say hey we want everybody to vote and we're not going to worry as much about you know things like exact mad shooting and voter id and that sort of thing which is ...\nWell because he wanted to say hey we want everybody to vote and we're not going to worry as much about you know things like exact mad shooting and voter id and that sort of thing which is an an artful way of saying it so you just kind of meant\nIn my view I think we've got to change our mindset on the entire voting process and remember that voting is not a privilege is so right and when he has a right is involved every effort out to be made to include everyone Republicans Democrats independents black\nOr anything they say in what Brian how does that I didn't\nHear anything the barriers in ... in what he said the airport was of course\nThat uh he wanted his people to vote and didn't well or the other side the boat but the truth is everybody needs to vote and uh the more people that both the better off I think we all are and the more representative our democracy will come so I'm not offended by I think that shows you that not only are the Democrats are\nDoing the very aggressive procedures but also the Republicans I was shocked at the other day as well they should\nOut yesterday I checked out the voting a in Polk County and fleet of town I came back by checked out the voting in ... county and then call those ... Canada is not just happened to go by and the turnout is British people are moving people energized and these are ...\nStates raw wood that All right let me say Kevin uh I think here's the issue I mean it does sound like Brian kept saying let's turn out are Republican voters it'll be interesting to see how the Democrats Stacey Abrams may use is if she does in the debate tonight but does this so\nA raise the question of whether Brian kept might have been smarter too if given up his position to secretary of state overseeing the election and just run for office because in this tape\nHow do we differentiate between candidate camp urging his people to the polls and secretary of state camp and worrying about all those votes coming in for the Republican candidate I Do think\nThat the issue I mean it's a it's a fundamental\nUh uh you know I I guess I Would say uh just conflict or something maybe the state out a deal with I mean there are rules about when you have to leave office if you're going to campaign for another office but in this case they don't apply hand and\nI'll just say this I mean this that and other national media outlet coming in and making it sound like there's\nAll this craziness going on about voting I mean I get that is a hot issue on both sides but uh I just\nWell it coming in and making it sound like there's all this craziness going on about voting I mean I get that is a hot issue on both sides\nBut uh I just thank God for mark nice ER reporter who's covering the the whole issue of voter turnout suppression and all that the and I would just urge people to read histories 'cause he cuts through the last word or\nIf I can make three quick ... number one if a secretary camp had resigned from office earlier and we had had some of these controversies regarding voter registration or the ... campaign will be coming out against them how dare you abandon your seat when these things have to be fixed that's number one number two\nUh when it comes to the fifty three thousand or there's been a lot of uh inaccurate information about it and the ... campaign came out yesterday and show that three quarters of the people that are on that list are all on that list not because signature for all\nOf but because the Social Security numbers that were put on the registration forms or not the same ... or ... Social Security numbers are that these people have it in the system and number three\nAnd and you know the fact of the matter is a a you know people need to show up and vote and and and that's what both sides of the campaign or anyway\nI take one last second to say buddy it's conceivable that Republicans wouldn't be under the gun by Democrats and the national media which of course has been focused like a laser on Georgia with alleged voter suppression stories running left and right\nIt is Republicans who decade plus ago decided they needed to find stricter rules for who could voted new couldn't voter id photo ID when you go to the polls\nAnd they said they were doing it to prevent fraud but it planted ... didn't it for Democrats now comes back in a way to hunt them or as what might be innocent efforts to police who votes and who doesn't it are are interpreted through a more sinister lines\nWas Kevin says as an inherent problem here\nWhen you have a candidate and someone a partisan enforcing laws against everyone and I'm not saying what he's doing is wrong but everything you do is just such back look at the bottom tremble a disqualification situation down in in his district and it goes on and on because whatever he does now\nIs going to be a\nLot of suspicion or a wrong doing can gotta get real\nQuickly about the the id law or the Democrats went to their favorite federal judge judge\nSpecial wrongdoing can gotta get real quickly about the id law\nOr the Democrats went to their favorite federal judge ... Murphy the judge up and brought them back in two thousand Seventy thousand eight to claim that the ID laws were a worst voter suppression and judge Murphy in a very extensive border\nFound no evidence to support that allegation is it OK I take your point and you got\nThe last word in this segment you couldn't breathe easily now so could all of you were going to take a quick break and come right back on political rewind Julie Thompson there'll be joining us when we do [noise]\nYou know selling a car can be a hassle but donate again as a whole different story is split I was taking off your hands off your driveway and turn it in the public radio and maybe even a tax deduction ... rebel the host of marketplace here is how to do [noise]\nEight seven seven GP beat one car or donate securely online at ... dot org slash cars ten thanks [noise]\nAll right so we're going to watch what you're going to stay with us for the next few minutes oh yeah yeah I I Love that up because\nKevin a town house wants to know if you will clarify did you cast a provisional ballot and they were going to check your address or did they just accept it up to my really boy ... everything where I was\nReading about making their third but every thing in my address except the number the street and I'm like wow three alright ZIP Code was right everything was right when I Would suggest that had not been Kevin Kevin rally had\nBeen some other person in some other jurisdiction you may well have been denied that right to vote you are strong enough to insist on your position but uh most people would not have shown that kinda moxie that you demonstrated when you said that you'd be entitled to both well\nLet me also add that that you know as a Republican I'm agreeing with say say one thing she did say you show up at the polls and you insist on your right to vote on some someone says no you keep insist they set their own worst things about this ...\nSay but the one thing she did say you show up at the polls and you insist on your right developed some someone says no you keep insist they sat in on the worst things about this ... and ... and ... and ... what I Want to emphasize those fifty thousand people you can vote and they said that and I hope you do\nAnd so does a good Republican\nAll right well I started to say let's get another break out of the way we all continue the conversation Julie I'm Glad you can stay with us on the phone or Kevin I'm Glad you're here buddy Darden and as Lindsey will continue with all of you after this\nNext fresh air voting rights and voting restrictions like act with Ari Berman author and give us the ballot twenty four states have implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nRanging from requiring voter id is closing polling places also tell us about the seven states or Africa are being made to expand voting rights China\nShares this afternoon at three ... and the b._b._c. news dot org\nAh we're back um you know I ... every now and then\nWith an issue like either the Abrams Confederate flag burning or a camp are urging people the Republicans they better vote because Democrats sure well\nI I Do there's this little piece of music feels guilty because those in some ways are distractions buddy from the bigger issues that face this state and that can't canes themselves want to talk about so that in mind let's do a little reset here we had a debate tonight\nUm what are the issues if you were a panelist tonight one of the reporters on the panel what do you want to hear in the way of issues from Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp what issues do you think they are most likely to highlight and I'm going to go around and ask each of you that question\nI think the Democrats will emphasize healthcare because the state of Georgia we all know we're all going about twelve billion dollars in a federal money cents C. A. C. A. K. and my own in Georgia has and agree just record a in so far as\nA number of inch uninsured people we had that would be one to\nOur public schools are specially in areas of southwest Georgia and\nAnd ah in the central Georgia need need strong attention and that is a state wide concern of gray gray and finally finally public safety is always got to be an issue\nNeed need strong attention and that there was a state wide concern of great great and finally finally public safety is always got to be an issue though because that's their job was like ... in my in my opinion is that educated educated people who got good health care\nAnd to see that they are properly protect show those three bigger as law enforcement education and and of course they don't care\nFor Kevin Stacey Abrams has a focus a very very intensely\nOn expanding Medicaid it seems to be a pretty popular issue across the state of Georgia Brian Kemp uh doesn't think it's a good idea thinks it will end up costing the state too much money a but there's no question this is going to be something she'll talk about tonight right\nI Would be shocked if she doesn't find a way to talk about it when the first question is asked no matter what the question is\nBecause she has really taken that tact of it you know expanding Medicaid is the simple straightforward way to do things but the what she's really emphasizes made for healthcare rural hospitals all that kind of stuff that I think for average people they\nUnderstand that they understand preexisting conditions they understand their hospital closing\nA expanding Medicaid sounds like big government and I think a lot of people are less attracted to that kind of terminology but everybody from the moment Obamacare passed the most popular feature has always been coverage of pre existing conditions everybody can agree on that\nJulia and if you were giving household or Brian Kemp before the debate what would you tell him he should focus on a most intensely\nWell first of all I I Would tell him to focus on what he is going to do to strengthen the economy and helped job creation and the private sector um I agree with that either had access to quality health care and education\nAre definitely top ... issues with with everyone in the public safety issue is extremely important and also how that factors in to education and if I were advising blind camp\nI Would tell him to definitely felt gets on what he plans to do in schools\nI not only with getting the thirty thousand dollars and to start out as security to strengthen security in schools but also the five thousand dollar a parent teacher raises and how that is going to attract and retain quality teachers\nAd that I'm Glad you mentioned education\nNow they're a parent teacher raises and how that it's going to attract and retain quality teachers so ad that I'm Glad you mentioned education you know we already know that Medicaid expansion or as ... as the new vouchers for health care which\nIs the way he is explained to\n... as I understand it by building waivers rather I meant waivers now vouchers\nThey help people who are on the exchanges and wanted to save money they're not much there not much good for people who need healthcare don't have it to the other way and that's education\nA RINO Abrams is all in for public education she wants to take away the hundred million dollars the legislature now is put in place a for scholarships for students to go to private schools and camp in fact wants to expand a V. opportunity for people to go to alternative to a A R D well turn it into\nA public school so it's gonna be interesting to see how that plays it\nIt it will be an interesting contrast and uh you know when it comes to public education or if if I was camp a incomes advisors I did two things number one is that I had healthcare head on first\nOr the fact of the matter is a Medicaid waivers to give states more flexibility and taking care of the the least among us is something that works worked in Arkansas it's working in Indiana and other places it was him I'd come straight out of the box and say look\nYou've got a one size fits all I Want to come up with the Georgia plan to to make health care better for all Georgians and this is what I'm going to do so I take that that away from her from day one number two is on education\nYou know I'd hit her on the fact that that she's talking uh uh about continuing a an education system that's a hundred years old and he wants to look at an education system that works for all Georgians and the twenty first century through greater school choice to not only against uh the the the the teacher\nBy the ... the student a scholarship program but she's also against charter schools she'd been very\nVocal opponent of the state charter school system which has been a very successful program and was voted for overwhelmingly by the people George in two thousand twelve\nAnd so I'd come after her on her or inability to go after school reform to bites could improve the quality of education\nAnd I'd come straight out of the box and talk about my plan on health care when it comes to helping them particular rural areas those are my two things that hit on we all know that the key to the to the night for both candidates there's not to say something dumb stupid and are not\nEven her us on the show yeah yeah\nAnd I for both candidates is not to say something done much do\nAnd not even her us on the show yeah yeah you don't mind that you can lose it and you can lose it tonight but you can't win it and I don't think that many votes they're going to be changed\nHowever a if a person made an incorrect top police you saw a dumb or stupid statement that might be more likely\nTo video or you think I mean I I I agree with you I had a friend of mine who studied debates for years is always used to say that debates don't change anyone's mind that you go into the debate you'd have to Canada and went in they won and people are undecided aren't watching anyway\n[laughter] well I think you're right in terms of but you don't you can't really tell some of the some of the smartest people I've ever known have gotten into a debate and they get themselves caught up in the fact how smart they are Roy Barnes is one of the smartest politician we've seen in this state\nSaid something about probably accurate in a debate but he said it in such a way that was cold at Cal Cal us in sounding and that's when he said children die all the time who are in a state system\nA and you know I Know what he meant by it but that's what he said and and his opponents beat him over the head and two thousand to ... hours later and it was a rotten egg right here when when he said and uh\nOf course obviously he should've qualified it and uh but what he said was absolutely true but we all know that people don't want to hear it in such a catalog and what they consider on feeling way but if I can give you one other thing real Baylor in terms of a question and this was a voucher reporters\nIt'd be real interesting to hear this answer\nA Amazon is still looking at us for you or a governor and Amazon came to you wanted to close the deal what would you propose that would be an interesting question\nAll right uh I'm not on the panel I don't I frankly don't even know who is and I should I Apologize for that but that isn't a bad question Julie and I want to go back to something you said", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "23"}
