the studios of NPR your entire now to\nA Kyle for those of you are hurting before no he is the creator or a ... of a peach pot which is a really terrific pod cast that deals with George politics even though you do it out of Washington\nYeah we appreciate that and it's good to be home I haven't been home in quite some time to be here for you political junkies you really ought to uh\nListen to a peach pot which is I'm sure available anywhere you get your broadcast right yeah okay let me start with you real quickly um we do know that both Johnny Isaacson and David Purdue have said that they will vote yes on confirmation of cabinet they voted for culture\nAnd a\nPurdue is in the cabin a corner from the very start basically even through the investigation Isaacson said he would support him at first and then when the investigation started the FBI took over he pulled back a little bit but he very quickly got back give me a Kevin our camp\nThey and this is Dan had committed to building for ... for all the allegations him as a conductor Ford came came\nKevin our camp exactly on both of them had committed to voting for for Cabot on before all the allegations from uh from Dr Ford came came forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our guys apart or not but if you don't mind be careful about how you describe it that's fair enough so that can get a ... point we take it and wanted to share with you right now but we'll watch the story unfold because it's clearly a campaign issue I'm Amy because you're an expert\nOn well you are on confirmation of federal judges real quickly how does this one compare with the typical confirmation of a federal judge she's\nOnly a lot different than they are as we're talking in the breaks at one of the things that's really different about it was the opening statement that Brett Kavanaugh cave and his second hearing\nUm I actually went back and compared his opening statement to that given by Clarence Thomas when we had sort of similar hearings with similar allegations and also the rest of the transcript\nAnd what was really notable is that so Clarence Thomas came and obviously very upset race gave sort of the famous line about high tech lynching but never directed at a certain party a certain set of groups\nCabinet his opening statement which was prepared right these aren't the remarks in the back and forth mentioned the Democrats or the left in pejorative terms eleven different times with a lot of other references to that side of the aisle et cetera and so that really was very striking because one of the things that\nMost characterizes judges is that they should not be viewing issues in necessarily this heavy partisan lens that they should be open to whomever might come in front of them and in particular it is very possible that some of the senators who opposed him some of these groups that are being\nA mentioned as being the left leaning groups against him will in fact have cases in front of him if he's confirmed and so that's concerning\nSo or you talk to John ... about this you said tomorrow\nSo I was asking because this has been such an atypical confirmation process and because it's brought out such ugly partisanship on both sides whether\nThis has broken the institution either either the Senate or the court or just civility and politics and he had a pretty upbeat attitude about all of it at the end of the day he didn't mention he thought this that it has sunk to the occasion\nBut but that I guess to him there was still room to move forward there are still people in the Senate who wanted to build bridges and keep working you encounter that with David Perdue and that really fiery speech on the floor we mentioned on Wednesday and it doesn't seem like he's in the same place he was blaming Democrats for really inciting a lot of these protesters\nHe was blaming Democrats for really inciting a lot of these protesters he didn't mention Maxine Waters that by name but you know he did mention his famous speech he gave after Sarah Huckabee Sanders standards was kicked out of that restaurant in in Virginia basically saying if you see a cabinet member in public you should get in their faith kick them out\nAnd ended Purdue he thinks that you know that's why the institution has sunk\nWell it's one thing to deal a coyote it does strike me that it's one thing for constituents voters you've even if they're not your constituents to come up to you and talk to you about how they feel about issues or maybe they really do it\nI Do wonder you know the one part of produce speech where I thought well I'll get what he's saying is that notion of confront him in restaurants confront them at gas stations make believe\nThat does strike me as giving ... meat to Republicans to fight back against those democratic protesters\nWell an interesting as it relates to the legitimacy of the corn I think the jury all kind of be out on that entail Democrats regain power and to see what kind of pressure comes on the Democratic party to maybe try to get even for the Merrick Garland\nIncident at the end of the Obama administration there's a lot of energy on the left right now to try to get Democrats to take the Supreme Court more seriously as an issue\nTo get voters to take it more seriously but also to get interest groups to rally around nominees to make this an important thing the Democratic party stands for and how far they go when they regained power where I think will also add to the story\nAmy I'm a question about the way in which review the court today\nWe go back to two thousand we go back to Bush legal war and the decision that put George W. Bush in the White House\nToo many people was seen as to the beginning of the Supreme Court in the United states becoming a partisan political battle\nInteresting about all of this is that over half of the Supreme Court decisions every year or unanimous it doesn't get a lot of attention it really goes underneath the pride but\nTheir unit so all nine justices or eight as they may currently be agree they come out the same decision they see the decision and the same light and\nWhen it goes well about the majority if we add in cases where only a single judge ... one eight to one vote in the city is a very few of the decisions are five to four but that's what we focus on\nThe better stories there the sexier decisions that are being handed\nIs that that very few of the decisions are five to four but that's what we focus on to the better stories there the sexier decisions that are being handed down there the topics people know\nWell or the sexier but also in many cases very consequential I mean for instance a re evaluation of roe v Wade could lead to a split decision it's sexy incredibly controversial right\nDefinitely don't we just for these days is only hearing about eighty cases a year they're all consequential they all have massive implications they might be social they might be economic\nRight but they're having massive implications about what's going down and even on some of these issues that are highly consequential the justices do agree in the end so on some level there is that part that's under it however\nRight there is a sort of growing concern that if they're viewed though as a solely part ascend body so it's less about what they're doing and more about how they're viewed\nThat that could have concerns about how people are going to listen to their decisions\nWhen they go down because on some level it really doesn't matter it's five to four the question is are the people that it affects going to listen to what they say\nBut this is not just said tomorrow Amy is not suggesting that the Republican effort to put a very conservative justice on the court they believe is going to help them win in crucial cases perhaps in abortion rights case um\nPerhaps on whether a president of the United states can in fact\nBe a subpoenaed or indicted I mean so that does have consequences but Amy saying be a little careful about thinking of this is part is necessarily it's maybe just the judicial philosophy totally\nBut I think part of what got Donald Trump to the White House there are a lot of groups including Christian's social conservatives who perhaps wouldn't have agreed with the president on a lot of things but who decided having a conservative nine to Supreme Court justice getting that was worth everything else all the other back\nAlright gotta stop we got a lot more to talk about but a Bradley and Emily are standing by because as we come to the very end of this pledge drive\nWhen you have to give them before because we don't and if we don't get help from all of you out there we won't have the four for a whole lot more girls go back to breath and\nGiving you the floor right now because it is your choice to support G.
