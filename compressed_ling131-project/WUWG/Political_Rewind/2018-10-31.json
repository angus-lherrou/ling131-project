force one for a political rally somebody had to pick up the cost of those wheels band on [noise]\nAnd the party whomever he was going to campaign for a long and so when I see that happen and you've taken all those kind of expenses I think that there's desperation on their polling that we don't say All right\nBy the way I realized I lucked out a piece of crucial information and talking about the ballot order the way the state rules or ... or read or that the party in power get the first position if you're the governor\nIf the governor is a Republican than Republicans occupy the first position
