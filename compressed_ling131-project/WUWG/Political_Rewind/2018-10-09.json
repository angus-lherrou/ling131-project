Kennesaw states\nI went to Kennesaw stay in Nineteen Ninety two when I was a doctoral student at Georgetown oh a little while and you've never left now they can't get rid of me and now the acting dean of the school of knowledge of humanities and social sciences\nI don't know how with all the red tape that you've got to Wade through the bureaucratic stuff you can come in but I'm sure glad you're here to be here and Brian Robin sit in a Republican political consultant a communications director for governor Nathan Deal during his first term\nWorked on Capitol Hill how long did you work up the hill for different people seven years\nA communications director for governor Nathan Deal during his first term worked on Capitol Hill how long did you work up the hill for different people seven years wow All right thank you for being we passed one bill\nAnd you're saying that all over the state that bat strategy is working granted those books only get one vote once during the ... they can't come back on election day so maybe they were going to vote any way but Democrats are getting votes in the bank Republicans need to be aware of that and\nThey need to if they're not going to be here they need to get their absentee ballot\nWe learned that from you because Republicans have done that so effectively over the years\nI'm Sorry oh All right so let's go back to this notion of how you spend your money for a second I'm I get it TV is still powerful as a a an a medium for advertising but TV doesn't reach\nAn awful big chunk of the potential electorate that I think I'm right to say Stacey Abrams wants to tap into\nIf you want younger voters if you're hoping to motivate young people to go to the polls are not reaching them with a TV ad because of their like my children my grown children they're not watching TV\nAny more or less true I mean it does depend on who you're trying to reach out to I mean to reaching younger voters is all about social media ... which is why you pointed those things that are out of the thing is though who votes in a midterm election year I mean is a is a millennial voters or is it the traditionally older voters who are going to be watching TV so it depends on what kind of an election year that's\nThe key question is is is a one word when you're doing polling when you're trying to determine who's going to vote I think it's a mistake to uh to look at this as a traditional election year I think the electorate is going to look different this year than ... than they did in two\nThousand way going back to those suburban women I mean this keeps coming up this and I'm a you know I heard from both sides said oh they're they're they're tired of Trump they're going to vote for a Democrat or those women who voted for Karen Handel\nWell here's the thing there on that Kevin and I don't want to get the Democrat perspective on this that are out a run that risk Karen Handel settled down enough of those two when she needs to and probably will get enough of those to win again and her reelection the thing is\nKaren Handel got all got enough of those two when she needs to end probably will get enough votes to win again and her reelection\nThe thing is that district the sixth district Republicans had never won by less than twenty points and then that margin got shrank down to what five six seven somewhere in there still healthy when for Karen in a big turnout alleged and the margin was still fairly big\nBut we ... we lost a lot of margin and so there are a lot of districts where we don't have twenty points to give we don't have when he points to give you a statewide race right because that Mars has been five to seven points by the last ... six to eight years\nSo that the issue is that we're losing enough of them to make a difference I'm marginal districts\nI I think a Sandy Springs mayor and and card carrying republic Ron Paul made a a very interesting point on on this very show where news is made every day every day or the day after the primary\nWhen he he he talked about what he'd seen in the northern Iraq in terms of primary votes for a for Democrats or the percentage of voters taking democratic ballots\nAnd he said and this was his phrase it there's a tectonic shift going on among voters in the northern arc\nOr are people who are economic conservatives but who are are put off by the religious freedom battles\nThey're they're put off by a Republican or stances on on the choices she on the abortion issue and they're voting with their voting democratic and I I think we we saw the the narrowing of the margin and that and that handle on suffice last year\nYou see some of that I mean back to the notion of suburban women I Wish I think is going to loom very large this year we think Brian Kemp doesn't understand how important that is I mean his proposal for raising teacher's salary I think is aimed directly at the female vote or I mean that's just a recognition there that is how big is going to be\nI I you know it's funny we talked the first day after he made that announcement I naively said well he's looking to win the teacher vote which is a powerful voting bloc in the states but currently and you're absolutely right I Would I neglected to see you immediately was this appeals\nTo some ... ... ... they're less when you ask them what issues are born with women it's much more important than it is for men\nI spoke to a a ... club ... east ... earlier this year after the session to kind of do a second recap and there was a state senator from east calm they're uh\nBut go ahead I spoke to a ... club ... east Cobb earlier this year after the session the kind of do a second recap and it was a state senator from east ... they're a senator Kirkpatrick a Republican and I've gone through what was you know basically the Republican win last because they're the ones who gets passed it\nAnd she came up to me afterwards and she said you forgot to mention that we fully fund the case of Trump education that's the most important you miss the biggest news black here so that is a Republican talking about what matters to the heart of the suburban moms in east ... the north\nPole and Kevin ... David Nathan deal during the last legislative session promise to bed his budget would fully fund education on this show in another political analyst side right away we got exactly the point it's everybody's making right now fully funding you'd be\nIs a huge step\nAnd it took in some ways it took a whole notion of school funding away from Democrats because for years Republicans who control the legislature and the governor's mansion have not fully funded Cuba about what's\nHappened Stacey Abrams based on what we know Democrats are interested in uh in polling has to own the education issue and he took it right away from\nI don't think he took it right away from her I I think he certainly captured attention on it but she's been out there talking about education a ...\nAbsolutely I don't think this is about whether the candidates and Abrams are addressing education may ... Abrams has really made it a showcase it in her campaign has more did you just would that funding mechanism what's through the ... let's get our first break the show out of the way when we come back\nIt's fascinating the people who are in the state it's a day campaigning for a Abrams and for him\nA we'll talk about that but let's take a break you're listening to political rewind\nFall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listen to cover the rising costs of programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life please take a moment now to make an online contribution fit a gp dot org and click donate at the top of the page\nYour contribution at whatever level is right for you fly out and cover the cost of the programs you live on ...\nThank you so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting\nWe're back Kevin Riley best Shapiro Kerwin swim Brian Robinson in the studio Brian I'm going to I Want to give you a little feedback\nWith broadcasting uh we're back Kevin Riley ... Shapiro Kerwin swim Brian Robin sitting in the studio Brian I'm going to I Want a job that want to give you a little feedback\nOn the last time you were on the show we got some Facebook Live pose for people who say why wouldn't bride Robbins in talks about the Democratic party does he call it the Democrat Party which is it typical Republican way\nDo you explain to our listeners why Republicans use that expression it's obviously derogatory of\nSubway [laughter] and I met her and I I Am now like I just thought that the nail ... radical party right here and I and my understanding of syllable and I'm a Hummer headline writer\nOkay if you like the Republican speech impediments lending them I think both said that than any of them that say of course of course right now it's like a call them the Communist Party at it that way it is on whatever I remember\nWhen that started I think it had to do with the Republicans who were did not want to call them Democratic Party because that implied\nDemocrats with a small D you know yeah the Democratic as in as in what this country is all about I just thought I'd share Brian's weaponized another word that's what you're saying\nKevin we eat today have visits from celebrities for ... camp or and for Abrams that couldn't in any better way to show the stark difference between who these candidates are appealing to so we have\nIn metro Atlanta today Elizabeth Warren\nA democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren a a well known liberal or an eye on a Presley who want a really big upset in Massachusetts in Boston she beat longtime democratic incumbent she's\nYoung upstart uh she was never expected to win the race but she did and again she's an outspoken liberal everybody's for Congress ... did I say that house oh I Apologize for Congress um rational seed in Boston on the other side\nYou have Donald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt foil from Louis from Fox News going out to address the crowd in in Athens you couldn't ask for a stark contrast and who those two candidates are appealing\nWrite well at least the Donald Trump junior is in the right place right Brian comes home town and I'm assuming that's yeah\nThat were started for contrast and who those two candidates are appealing to write\nWell at least the Donald Trump junior is in the right place right Brian comes home town and I'm assuming that yeah that way on purpose but yeah I mean I think it demonstrates just how\nFar apart we are in this country would look at those two and say oh my gosh I'm never you know I never ever going to see or support that person and you couldn't know which side they're on\nAt least Georgia has well balanced to the forest today is a dark here at the same time I won't say which is which\nRobert Gibson just told me that in Athens they are starting to barricaded the streets\nAre for the Donald Trump of parents which I think it started around five o'clock they actually it was invited I think first by the young Republicans at University of Georgia and the camp campaign it's an ad on rally is my understanding but their history is because of protests they're expecting will develop up there Brian\nOn this one of the thing is if this is allowed to have happen Beth is for there to be this backlash led now by the president of United States he too movement and suddenly we see this turned hundred eighty degrees or by a man\nOr who are saying they're victimized by women who make false accusations against him for regardless whether that's part is centered on non not part is and what sort of\nMorals are we living in when we've turned this around so that women suddenly are on the defensive\nFirst of all we are not on the defensive or it's clearly a very scary time for young men in America I'm and I'm Glad that the president know recognizes that for uh some groups of young men of color it it has always been a very scary time and I'm assuming he includes them in the group that he's worried about [noise]\nI you know this is this is who this president is a he is he is all man all the time and he's just using and health and that there's really no rational response\nThis is this is who this president is a he has his own man all the time and he's just being in health and that there's really no rational response to uh to uh things like that that that he says\nBrian I get there is some short term potential gains here to rev up the Republican base but but you as a Republican who wants to be involved with campaigns moving forward for perhaps decades to come what impact or is this going to have on the ability of Republicans to broaden their base\nThe me too movement the heat to movement but the turning this around against women who come forward\nYeah I I think it is a wrong assumption to say that all women\nBelieve every accusation against every man and and then it follows along the gender line it it does that I had around a lot of Republican women last couple of weeks were horrified by the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that they saw as politically motivated they saw as false accusations\nAnd false accusations do happen I think we have a responsibility and I think you've seen Republican senators going through the cabinet hearing respect this um standard it listen to what women have to say here them out look at the full evidence that they miss miss them out of hand and they didn't\nThey everyone got to have their say here's the problem is that the the new me to standard is every accusation it's true and I\nAn injury I had to stand up and fight\nThat I Will say Kerwin that I I see this from February ... I I think I see I understand various positions on this when I see a banner at a rally that says I Believe all women it strikes me\nThat it's one thing to say I choose to give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who's victimized at sort of horrible horrible thing\nBut when you make a blanket statement that to seems to me\nAs well intend to visit his play into this Republican backlash that suggests a bat a there are people making up stories every bit of research we've seen all of this as women do come forward and make up these stories that there is there's very few people who make up the story\nI think the most reasonable person would say it anytime dead somebody making that accusation has to be listen to you got to get in the air here and you've got to treat them with respect and that's what the the Senate\nWould say it anytime dad to somebody making that accusation has to be listen to you got to get in the rye or sharing you've got to treat them with respect you know what the the Senate's on the Judiciary Committee did\nA it is another thing to say that Brian that every accusation must be believed or even if there is no evidence even if there is no one else that comes forward and says hey\nAll right I Want to give you the last the token woman on the panel may have a moment just ... you are never have and woman panels\nAnd I think that when a woman comes forward that a person comes forward because there are men who have been sexually abused or what a person comes forward and says this happens to me and this happened to me or is happening to me that\nAt least we have to listen and maybe there are elements that we don't quite fine believable but I but I think that that what the me too movement is all about it if anything is that [noise]\nDon't dismiss out of hand accusations because they come from Michael Evans Matty as tempting as that might be don't dismiss them out of hand because there's no uh there's no immediate corroborating proof\nOr you know way back when ah and and the state of Georgia and and I know this from work I did back in the uh Seventy said date myself somewhat\nA we had a rape law we had raped laws in the state that required the woman to corroborate that she had been raped that she had to prove that the crime had been committed against her\nSo we've come a long way from those days are but I but I think that we haven't quite come far enough and and we let ourselves think that oh okay now it's time for backlash we don't we can dismiss somebody out of hand I I think we need to take a step back and just\nBe open to listening when a person comes forward\nTo it I really allowed this conversation going to do for a direction that I had not intended to do and I want to get back to Georgia but before I Do and before we take a break did you want to have a final comment\nI Would say the tragedy of what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings in this issue is that like in so many issues people who log on to their corners and instead of being able to say to a woman or to a man\nTell me why you see this thing this way they let me tell you why I see this thing this way and can't Wi Fi\nUnderstand this better can't we get to a better place than where we are now is a country and instead it's become I Believe women I don't believe women and I just think for the long term that's a sad place [noise] All right\nWe are now is a country and instead it's become I Believe women I don't believe women and I just think for the long term that's a sad\nPlace [noise] All right we're going to take another break I met said no uh when we come back ah I Do want to talk about uh two congressional races that are pretty hotly contested right now there are some good news good interesting news\nIn both the sixth and seventh district races and we'll talk about that you're listening to political rewind\nOn the next fresh air had terrorists government political campaigns and even street gangs are using social media to push propaganda and disinformation and fear with real world consequences we talked with the W. singer and Emerson breaking obvious that the new book black war the weaponization of social media\nCan share in fact in the right here I think he's an awfully long time to get out [noise]\nIf you recently supported gp during our fall fund drive thank you were already putting your dollars to work to bring you the programs that mattered ... if you didn't get a chance to donate during the drive and you are on line contribution now will still make a difference [noise]\nPlease take a couple of minutes to get a G.
