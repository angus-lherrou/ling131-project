this quite a week we expecting this could be a really late night about November\nSex and I always expect late last night but I don't think that the polls and we have another one and we'll talk about today but I Believe him when it says the race is close um I I reached out this this morning I reached out to a bunch of operatives in in campaigners in and party staffers that I that I Know and trust about a possible run off because of the latest poll shows that\nAnd they're saying you know we're ... we're sort of it's in the back of her mind but you know there's still a long two and a half weeks new\nWrite a great boost it of course a UC is ... every day or give me a dead tree edition and the paper and he also contributes throughout the day and the night\nTo the political insider blog at politically Georgia part of my AJC dot com stagger wild is back with this political science professor from Georgia State university ah it's\nGeorgia part of my AJC dot com Amy stagger while this back with his political science professor from Georgia State university ah it's great to have you back again Amy thanks for having me again next few Howard Franklin democratic strategist a consultant who\nThat's a that's right and the crosshairs was interesting to me too is how this is playing on the campaign trail I just spent two days\nA month to travel with Stacey Abrams campaign and it is not front and center of her of her campaign speeches or the voter registration issues and certainly a a something that she throws into hurricanes we should do it to to mobilize the the audience but it's still about expanding Medicaid criminal justice changes\nUm ... economy public school education but near the end of many for campaign speeches she brings it up and says essentially there's fifty thousand fifty three thousand pending votes\nHopefully all of them will get to vote but no matter what you go get another fifty thousand people to vote just in case she's she's challenging the crowd to to come up and even you know an even bigger numbers behind\nBecause of that there is one incident Howard that was reported a of the agency had it on the front page this morning and it does strike me as being quite a bit different then then the question of exact match or or you know uh other aspects that that people are are seizing upon\nAnd that's this strange story where a senior citizen Centre in Jefferson County\nUgh put together put together a group of mostly African and African American senior citizen Centre and they got on a bus to go to the polls to cast their ballots early and ah the bus was stopped\nAnd the ... the the the people on the bus were told they had to get off they couldn't use the bus they couldn't go vote a and the the the the justification given by the county officials was well we can ... this was organized by a woman who happened who's a democratic ah died of a county official\nAnd are they considered this to be a political activity at a county run a facility and therefore they couldn't do it that's the sort of incident which was really really riled up the opposition\nFacility and therefore they couldn't do that sort of incident which was really really riled up the opposition [laughter] whoa\nAbsolutely around us up I'll I'll go ahead and come over the member as fast as sort of thing that passes\nAs a as a rule making and and counties whether they're urban or rural um if it was somehow illegal or there was some policy against elected officials of any partisan stripe\nOrganizing their constituency helping transport them to the polls we wouldn't have half of the electorate electrical activity we see in the city of Atlanta every four years I think a big part\nOf what we try and I've been a part of a dozens of these efforts a big part of what we are insistent upon when we organize a particularly these early vote\n'em caravans for seniors as senior high rise centers of which there or something like fifty\nIn the city of Atlanta alone um we are very careful not to include part is in a campaign materials as a part of that transport and\nAll the same laws that apply to anyone who might be electioneering anyone who might have a a preference for how folks are cast their ballots still apply that a hundred and fifty feet that you've got to remain\nFrom the from the ... point with aside still are in place I don't think there should be any rules that were preclude folks getting help up until you get to that so I mean what did you make of it when you saw this story\nIt was in the sense of what was the reason for stopping it and where are the suggestions of where it would be I mean I think what is in part coming up with a question of what the bus have been stopped if\nThe people that were on the bus look different or if they thought they were going to vote in a different way and those are the types of things that we don't want I don't want there to be right we don't want it to be that we think about this going to be stopped if it has a group of\nOlder white folks and we definitely don't want it to be stopped if we think it's going to have a group of\nYou know older African American folks or Latino et cetera and so I think some of this is also making sure that again it's getting rid of that subjectivity that concern that you were asking brag about with the one person making the decision or the possibility that the rules are being applied\nIn one way in one county in one and another because sort of the concern about\nThe kind of massive decentralization we have with a hundred and fifty nine different counties is that you might have a hundred and fifty nine different rules here ... Jackie\nYou're pulling up ... tells him better the reason\nIs that you might have a hundred and fifty nine different rules ... Jackie\nSalad actually pulling up ... tells him better the reason that they actually not that I didn't have to concern in part of it we do have a hundred and Fifteen hundred counties so you have a hundred and fifty nine different\nPeople make these Mrs now I have a chance that there were thousands of we need them\nI mean I think in in ... maybe not right that the um Jefferson County Democratic Party chairwoman Diane Evans how organized than there is that 'cause I mean and I don't know what the rules for but you know I had to give people the benefit of doubt ... hopefully it was done in good faith clearly we don't want anyone stop from voting everyone should be allowed to that um\nShe was hoping that the people on that bus we're going to vote for anything any harder an and they're only getting killed in Georgia and trust me all the expenses of her body was not a new thing and that's where the\nVice chair or chair of the local Democratic Party who's involved but look there's video of it um where where there was no overt political statements that was just trying to energize\nThe senior citizens to vote and just the image of them being pulled off a bus it was getting ready to go to early voting sites and more to the point there's nothing there were conversely preclude that same Republican vice chair chair saying hey\nSome of the voters who are here in the senior center in this county facility might be Republican voters and we want to aid their transportation to the polls are well so I don't think that that should be the the qualifiers to I Want to get\nTo our first break but before you Amy just to finish this subject out um I said this isn't a note that I shared with all the view of this morning about some of the things we wanted to talk about um\nThis has become this is more tribalism\nThis is not about a search for the truth or in most cases it is it it it is just search for a weapon an advantage to use against the opposition and as a result of that\nI'm hopeful that people like Greg Greg boosting them that we are on this show for instance are able to say yeah you know there are understandable why some people may voter suppression is happening but here's the reality what this is this the other hand we can give the other side of it but the reality is\nThis is tribalism edits at its best\nIt is and there was a really neat study that came out at least in an intellectual than maybe\nBut the reality is this is tribalism edits at its best [noise]\nIt is and there was a really neat study that came out at least in an intellectual than maybe not for the findings that showed that partisanship has basically becomes the new sort of community tied that people look it's much more like sports teams that it's much more is that you knew the opposition as immoral or unethical\nAnd it's even a clip things sort of our old sort of ways that we would a dentist five with in our community people sort of see themselves first as whatever their purchase an identity as and I think the concern there is that then leads to sort of other concerns about how we process information what we think of the sorts of information\nWhether or not we're willing to um listen when we're given information about something that doesn't matter preconceived notion\nOne single Greg is it give you the last word on this is when we will get to the button by a court several courts will infect rule on these law suits and they will give us some sort of definitive answer about these definitive might not be the right way\nThere's going to be going to be the twenty twenty battle and the twenty twenty to battle as well as rack and forth All right let's do this let's get a vote to break out of the way\nWhen we come back let's talk a little gray you we do have new early voting numbers based on all of yesterday let's talk about that let's look at the demographic breakdowns\nAnd what they may tell us and also a brand new poll and oh we love him we know how much you loved pulling out there in the audience and we'll get to that after these messages [noise]\nYou know selling a car can be a hassle but donating it as a whole different story but I was taking off your hands for off your driveway and turn it into public radio and maybe that tax deductions to resolve the host of marketplace and here is how to do\nEight seven seven GP be one car or donate securely on line a gp dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\n[noise] well come back to a political reason why we have now had two full days of early in person voting or I mean we're by now this hour in the afternoon on Wednesday half a day in to a third day\nGregg the turnout continues to be pretty astonishing uh the person turn out and then of course adding the absentee ballots the early ballots by mail it really is something it's\nIt'd be pretty astonishing uh the person turn out and then of course adding the absentee ballots the early ballots by mail it really is something\nIt it is something we had we had about Seventy thousand people vote Monday which was three times more than the same period in fourteen and we had even more than that\nVote yesterday Seventy five thousand also hold if you can also kind of the roughly Seventy thousand mail in ballots that have been processed we've got about two hundred and Fifteen thousand a total vote count which is again more than three times higher the number of early votes cast of at the same period and two dozen fourteen\nSo um there's a website that I'm Robert give us and we ought to a tweet this out Georgia votes dot com\nThere's a a there's somebody out there who seems to be doing a pretty good job of keeping track of the data as it comes out of county officers um he has it around two hundred and twelve thousand people who voted early\nUh at this point um as opposed to the last midterm swimming number was sixty seven thousand a white votes now the ... voting has started in person seemed to be a higher than a black votes women are voting it's somewhat higher levels than men are at this point\nBut enough to ... enough to raise the possibility of\nA runoff yeah you said the are where to go home\nI see so here's what's interesting it's ... I\nCan I interject about because I Want to come to important to note that the reason that that could be the runoff is not even that undecided vote it that\nIt have you ever wins half to get to fifty plus plus one friend and so if there's any type of third party while we have a Libertarian Party don't then it pushes it tore especially in a close race that there's going to be a run off and we didn't learn it\nAnd he's been pulling a two percent and pretty much every poll which is getting his within the margin of error so\nUm but Republicans are hoping and they're ... they're starting to see the numbers of their own showing that has his supporters taper off a little bit he'll probably get two percent no matter what happens but um it it it yeah that that could raise definitely raise the ... and there's also a force candidate um who's in the race to get you know a small sliver of the vote\nWhat's interesting to me about this is the um I Love to look as across town or the other questions rather so for instance um writers ask a Georgia voters would be a most\nThis is the um I Love to look as across state or the other questions rather so for instance um writers ask a Georgia voters the most important problems facing Georgia today I'm ... I'm\n... I'm Sorry what's the most important problem facing the United states today but these are Georgia respondents um I thought it was interesting that it's not surprising that Eighteen percent said health care because that mimics almost every other poll we've seen but but Jackie\nThat raises this question of whether Republicans may be\nA pat on the wrong stream if they're not cautious about how they talk about uh uh uh not expanding Medicaid here in Georgia Brian Kemp doesn't want to expand Medicaid or we think that Congress would if it's a Republican Congress would maybe go back and look at ah\nGetting rid of AC a again I mean this is a tough issue for Republicans right now isn't it\nI think that if you look at a lot better Democrat versus Republican Democrat but then it twenty seven percent and like the Republicans that matters but that the Seventeen percent\nSo there is a split among party lines and I do think that that is something that um that that we need to think about very thoughtfully but it's really in reality if you don't have a system that works it overall I mean it's bad for the country is a long term\nBut Republicans core belief is that a single payer system doesn't work because I've been hearing it just doesn't work say you had to come up with a different solution\nThat if you're looking at Republicans had their ... their top concern for veterans is immigration right so I Do think also that if you look at the kind of like what's happening with ... with the races that kind of reflect what the core issues are and buzz constituencies\nUm what other numbers in there were I was surprised I Want to share with you morality came in at twelve percent of Americans said morality was a a big issue for them and in fact I'm more Republican likely voters than Democrats pick morality what is is\nAll about it so it also but this is also interesting when when when asked about who would better handle these social divides against morality and fall under voters gave Abrams advantage over camp also they gave her the advantage on health care is managed ... education the environment\nCamp at a slight edge over a bridge on economic issues they're awesome errors AJC pull 'em at a wider advantage on immigration law and order poses the issues that he's focusing on he seems to be doing better on the issues focusing on health care is one of them she seems\nIn a wider advantage on immigration law and order poses to the issues that he's focusing on he seems to be doing better on the issue she's focusing on health care of one of them um she seems to be doing better on a and again that that the health care one was a little different ... both of them neck and neck to this poll showed her with a clear advantage on the issue I have I Want to\nAsk you a question about just what you're talking about a little while ago you said that you talked about Abrams when you were out with her for two days and you've been out with with camp obviously for for tours of the states\nAre they both equally discipline in the way they focus on the issues that they say are the most important so it was of course did our show last friday and\nWas strikingly disappointing to share her message is clear ah she knows what she wants voters to hear from her I haven't been out with cap is kept doing the same thing\nYeah here as for the for the most part he his his his campaign appearances tend to be a little shorter speeches at least and then he spends a lot of time taking pictures were folks afterwards um but his are much more sharper attacks on Abrams\nA and that's been like the way since he won the runoff she's only more recently begun to lease her speeches with attacks on him and that that that really run through the last couple of days or we wrote a story back in August or September saying that she's ... she's larger laying off of him well that's not no longer\nThan two weeks that I think there's also I think we've gotten a clear sense of what the bottom lines are obviously this back and forth on whether or not I I think regulate this out well now these are two are elected officials who operated from underneath the gold dome for\nHalf a decade now all across the certain set of issues\nAnd now that there seems to be evidence or at least enough to to charging allege that there's miss doing from the secretary of state's office that couldn't just be folly\nThey wouldn't just be bad administration I think she's got an argument that knows voters understand intrinsically right you don't have to if we're talking about expanding access to the ballot or suppressing\nOr access to the ballot most people don't need you to identify which party might be guilty of which which offense right and I think that that in that obviously isn't Bolden are I think to press down on us at ... on the charge as opposed to doing what she initially started with which is I'm just going to bring more people to the party than you do\nYeah well I think that's nice though is we don't have to determine policy positions on these two candidates there's actually been a lot of policy\nI was gonna say that I think that's nice though is we don't have to determine the policy positions of these two candidates there's actually been a lot of policy attention given they both have given very policy speeches they'd give it a lot of information out there haven't been as much about how we actually all I Would disagree\nWith that I you know we I was on political view on a couple of weeks ago we were talking about a similar topic as are related to policy and I did I uh actually mentioned this to Bryan\nWho's often on and I and Robin love and saying and I ... I went on both of the candidates websites and what I've found for the camp website 'cause I really wanted to be read up and prepared to have a discussion\nWith many of the links on a website or press releases or there were endorsements from people who might be Ohio sorry\nWe said Amy just to go back to you I when I go in the states the ... website they list several a number of issues have very sparse bullet points it isn't as if they're laying out big position papers them so I'm not sure\nThat looking at what they've got and their weapons are saying this is Sara Lee an indication of whether they're talking\nAbout policy contrast are clearly there and that's what makes the race is one of the voters or a contrast because we've had elections with us where the Kennedys agree on many other things and disagree in a few big ones and there's one there and there are polar opposites on so many of the biggest divides in Georgia I'm you know from criminal justice to\nTo tax policy the budgetary issues to social issues when your name and guns\nAnd and so that makes it and I think that if ... even if it's not available on their websites and it probably should be a we spend a whole week last week an agency just writing seven stories in a row model of different seven to ...\nAnd at least the political scientists when I'm excited by is that the voters are recognizing these differences spray really of whether or not they have choices the voters recognize that there are in fact competing caught and contrasting claims that they are going to go for it and so it's giving them something to pick from so you're in a way you know\nI think it's really interesting because I think it's much closer race if he's kind of step back and look at the big picture considering that whereas you know we're doing very well I can honestly it in the state we never went for business we've had a fantastic governor Nathan Deal and many people thought when he was coming in they weren't sure about him but he's a great job with criminal justice reform means really weren't in education\nI think it's really fascinating that if you look at that and kind of step back\nIt ... it would look at that'd be easy for camp to win nothing from a pure like this one regardless of what he said to me she she's a very good candidate I mean I couldn't say that to a couple of years ago that Hillary Clinton she wasn't\nThe easy for camp to win the infamous purer like this one will garlic and what he said to me seems to me she's a very good candidate I mean I couldn't say that a couple of years ago that Hillary Clinton she wasn't a good candidate for the Democrats\nSafe havens with a great candidate but I Do think they provide very clear choices and I just had I mean the people go through and look at the decisions because it's a it's a real decision I think that people need to be thoughtful about it and I did get worried sometimes that that they get so caught up in the back and forth and\nThe headlines from the media ... it's an easy to get me if I had a fellow new TV had to really dig into what the policy main\nAlright hum let's take on what are very quick let's do this quickly growing because we talked I mentioned at the beginning of the show I wanted to get into it and we got to get to a break um visceral rigs in Mexico is suddenly are dealing with this issue that her\nFamily trucking business is the subject of a lawsuit filed by a ten or eleven of the employees of the company up in Indianapolis are alleging racial discrimination I think there may be at least one allegation of some form of sexual harassment harassment\nOr did did no surprise Jeff Duncan campaign her opponent Republican opponent is\nGoing after her on this and and raise a Amigo now says hey ah you're lying about me and uh you ought to be demanding that you withdraw the allegations you've made ... tell us a little about this\nYeah that and and then I I I think it's fair to say this delighted Republicans because they got them to air this whole thing because it came from a lawsuit hum so ah but basically the the the illegal campaign is calling on Republicans to retract um attacks on her based on this lawsuit", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "17"}
