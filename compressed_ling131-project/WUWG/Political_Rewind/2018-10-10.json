George national guardsmen he extended the state of emergency to another sixteen counties now covers about a hundred and eight counties host of\nA south of middle Georgia and parts of north east George even as well now and said basically get prepared hunker down he did not order any sort of mandatory evacuation says he trusts Georgians to decide that for themselves to be prepared and be prepared for extended power loss after the storm which could cause additional problems just\nBefore we went on the air a town ... told me that ah the storm hit the hurricane hit a landfall near Panama City with winds of a hundred fifty five miles an hour which puts it\nAbout a mile less than a category five storm so this is a very dangerous storm and it's going to move through as you've been hearing throughout the day and many news reports\nAbout a mile west than a category five storm so this is a very dangerous storm and it's going to move through as you've been hearing throughout the day and many news reports are just going to move into south Georgia very quickly bird murder\nA camp and Abrams of up about forty percentage points actually I think uh maybe smaller than that\nI'm In order for me to be able to say definitively that that's telling me anything so I'm gonna chalk this up to sample size and that just kind of a let that go understand that there's a lot of statistical noise they're older and I'm always curious and\nOwner you are an expert when people say their independence or they're telling the truth and secondly in this hyper emotional climate which I perceived to be hyper emotional at this time out of the impact polling\nWell I mean so here's where people who are self described independence our I actually believe that the number of independents ... table and the country and it's actually a really small percentage of folks who are truly truly independent\nSo and survey questions when we asked party identification when people say that they're independent you usually follow up with a question about okay so do you lean democratic\nOr do you lean Republican I'm\nWhen I see that question or when I'm working with data I take those people who claimed to be independent but we'll have knowledge leaning one way or the other I put them in the same category as part of science and the thing about all of these surveys is that they're not terribly clear I literally ask\nPeople um at at eleven alive about this yesterday I was like okay so where did the leaders going this because I Can't tell from this\nAnd so what I suspect because this is a larger group of folks is that you actually have a lot of millionaires who are sort of being counted in that group soldiers waiting lists and makes it harder to decipher it would it would make more sense for me to do what they are but I have no proof one way or the other that that's what's going on\nThere I was just going to say that I think there are people are saying are independent um this year probably more so than other years but [noise]\n[noise] yeah I was just going to say that I think that uh people are saying they're independent um this year probably more so than other years but\nI Do think because Georgia at least historically has been more right of center you probably have more of those independents that lean Republican but are saying that they're\nUm that they're independent and I think that\nThe the actions of the candidates right now are are sort of determining how those people are split you know for example\nAnd I know we're going to talk a little bit more about this later but you know Elizabeth Warren coming in for Stacey Abrams while that energizes for democratic base which is really important and she needs that\nUh I think it will take some of those leaning Republican independence and move them more towards Republican because Elizabeth Warren is such a lightning rod a for those that are on the on the ... ... more Republicans\nFor the other things we're watching for these polls is Trump's approval rating and there was another poll ... from the public policy um polls polling\nJanet ... a pretty liberal organization from that showed um Trump's approval rating around fifty percent in Georgia which has a much higher than the ... Ga pull out two weeks ago at about forty one percent\nI'm so watches these polls you're seeing his disapproval ratings stay around the same ... you know fifty fifty one percent and most of these polls but if Trump's approval rating start to rise to more compared to polls just a few weeks ago that's another sign that there could be more Republican energy not just around a you know then it's like ... the foreign command got also got enough\nI'd be interested to see what your poll says tomorrow the change their with regards to the president 'cause I and this is just completely anecdotal I have found that those more independent leaning Republican voters\nThat Kavanaugh nomination has really move them into more solid Republican Soviets\nTouching the messaging Republican messaging as I can I help the Republicans that's coming out of the mountains of every single Republican talking head and senator or whatever\nYou feel it I feel it to not just what I'm hearing that are working handling\nSomething different ceiling looking from my crown fried Democrats ceiling a a real um anger and energy and this can't be happening again\nRight you know it may be energizing both both sides\nFeeling a a real um anger and energy and this can't be happening again right you know it may be energizing both both sides I think at best is going to energize both sides or worse so\nI don't want to weigh in on the state I kinda wanna go back and just correct myself actually had natural three okay um you know the gal that sample the hundred people that margin embarrassed plus or minus ten which means that it's gotta be something greater than twenty percentage points in terms of the difference\nIn order for it to matter and ... ... what is going in the opposite direction of what we've seen before it is a Seventeen point difference I'm Seventeen point difference between camping Abrams amongst independent they're looking at ... ... ... which means that has to be greater than eight in order\nSo let me let me do this let me put it up period on this portion of the conversation but do it this way it is very difficult on radio without the ability to show you graphics to really grasp of this kind of data so great let me say this\nAnd you correct me if I'm wrong the surveys usa poll tells us sick very much what other polling has also shown us which you use the race right now between ... and Abrams is very very close\nA Bruce right now according to surveys usa is getting about twenty five percent of the white vote\nThat certainly the threshold for what she needs of white voters if she expects to win and she's getting more than thirty percent of the African American vote and certainly needs\n... above that so this raises a horse race and it's those independent voters who are going to determine after more than Ninety percent of African American vote which is you want to be a more than thirty percent of the overall like that's what I was the thirty percent of the overall\nLike exactly and as you look at these polls just keep watching for that the number of other side of the continue to dwindle in and look at the look at the floors forty five forty five ... the poll a couple of weeks ago now we're seeing more polls show them at forty six forty seven percent it's a very narrow race\nBut remember keep in mind Stacey Abrams entire campaign is built on transforming the electorate she's always going to say these polls are are not going to accurately reflect her her support because she's trying to expand the you\nUnder the table it probably understand it enough to talk intelligently about it but my greatest fear is that a dead heat electorate is going to resolve\nNo your greatest\nFear is that it's a dead heat electorate is going to result in the libertarian getting at least three points and that's kind of dictator\nRun over to the head and Iran are tense run off\nAnd I think that that's a possibility but in terms of sort of how pollsters should wait there surveys and and and ... most of them are looking at about or they're hitting it or they're waiting it to be about a thirty percent black electric which would actually be an increase over in midterm year and that actually smart\nI mean I think it's why so I mean ... if they can get black turnout to be thirty five percent of the overall total that\nShe wins but\nThe whole no pulse during their right mind is actually going to sort of like set their demos to that because like that that you know we want to be conservative and making these estimates and you want to hedge your bets and the reality of it is is that all these surveys had six hundred to a thousand people were only going to be so accurate and actually being able to predict what the actual numbers going to be\nAll right I don't want to I don't want to bury the leader I mean Margaret adjusts introduced the topic that we want to at least spend a couple of minutes or ... it does raise it remains is closed and who knows I mean the polling is a snapshot of the moment not a prediction of the outcome are we headed for potential runoff here\nWell if you take the numbers were just talking about and and um representative Oliver was correct with regards to the libertarians going to get a percentage of the vote however\nI just feel like as we get closer and closer to the election uh there's going to this is going to break and I think I think Brian's gonna edge it out now of course I I I'm sure you're going to disagree with me I think it's all about energy but I I think that that's what's gonna happen and we'll we'll we'll avoid\nIt in the campaign stalking runoff quietly with few quietly I'll say this to the the libertarian four years ago ... was a vote who you didn't have much money but he was a vocal presidents he was out there I'm Ted nuts we haven't heard from him at all I'm just zero and I don't know how much that affects\nBut Paul after poll usually has the libertarian at two percent which is within the statistical negligible\nMore of\nAn accidental is two to three percent and if you're energizing young people young people tend to be in the Emirates Decatur community tend to say they're more libertarian um I'm really\nYoung people tend to be and man Emirates Decatur communicate tend to say they're more libertarian um I'm really nervous about around\nAll right let's move on to a a Eric already brought it up a great good we had some powerful a surrogate ... visitors in our state yesterday for each campaign\nA little bit worn and I honor Presley we're both here in metro for a Stacey Abrams and of course Donald Trump junior and his\nIs a pair of or that are more\nKimberly yo filed a former ... just really cracked up when I use that word ally if I said hey ... you would have been up to the Gulf and white neutral ... alright uh so they were out there and ... and you know I mean this point yesterday [laughter]\nYou could not ask for better contrast for these people come in you could not ask for more perfect a difference between the ... surrogates who are here for these candidates yesterday you were at UGA with Donald Trump junior house rent\nAnd then saying modeling that that's\nProbably a very I don't mind the event that on the plane\nFour years\nFar as animals or what ...\n... where did that come from the she feels that the ... video and the audio were cut short she went on to describe the other thing you could push a governor out but she talked about me too and Brian Kemp\nYeah and and really I mean there have Brian campus focused on on his marriage throughout the campaign\nUm he has his wife Marty has figured prominently in this campaign messaging um so so they take this as a as a deep insult um this that you have a democratic candidate for lieutenant governor questioning or basically his his his his as fidelity it does feel like a terrible misstep\nOn ... and I think it's because we're trying to figure out exactly what she's talking about that we don't know anything about it actually is she talking about anything we don't know about well I mean I don't know and so I think that that's what makes this weird I don't know if she's trying to reference to step up to massage parlors again but I mean again\nOh no about well I mean I don't know and so I think that that's what makes this weird I don't know if she's trying to reference of stuff about the massage parlors again but I mean again I don't see how that would take him down because it wasn't like he was at the massage parlor\nI think it could have been reference to the massage power issue which is why singer issues for the bad dentist and the bad that I used to be a hearing officer for those board so I Know yeah there's some terrible cases they could have been that\nIt could have been a misstep it could have been in the fact that he employs as secretary of state I don't know how many hundreds of people and that there's an employee issue under his broad management but I certainly have no information though rumors even about\nA specific me two instances specifically related to him by\nI think it's so cheap political shot by political novice and I think utilizing things like me to for political purposes is disgusting\nJust before we got here the echo\nPairing us earlier how do you feel about\nThings that have come to light and the me too movement but I think using it for political purposes as disgusted by it shows that she's enough before we\nGot here deco Eric we had we heard from 'em ... Julian Thompson as often on this show who had about fifty names of grassroots Republican women who also to central same thing and and Julie ... was a this has intellectually insulted Georgia voters\nTo say here's the whole quote in Sarah amigos desperate attempt to obtain name recognition choose intellectual you insult to Georgia voters Brian Kemp is a good man he's a man of faith a husband and a father I'm Mary Margaret this does it does this have legs\nI Can't know I Do know that the messaging coming out of the Republican leadership and the messaging at all levels is attack attack attack these women are just you know not to be believed their their ... their mobsters et cetera et cetera et cetera so it's consistent with the national message\nThat women should not be talking about being a victim if you talk about a victim that means you're weak that's the message came specifically from a Donald junior yesterday something\n... says that that's the national message if you look at the state leadership and mistakes the Republican leadership you don't hear a Johnny Isaacson you don't hear governor deal you know talking about that well dude produce\nThat I Would say I'm just a little bit more in the Trump campaign to know you Joni as eggs and saying that Nathan Deal there\nOh they produce that I Would say I'm just a little bit more in the Trump campaign to know you Joni as acts and saying that ... um my ears and perhaps ears are listening a little bit more closely I think the insults that are coming from the Republican leadership are significantly means\nThere are so okay so let me way and then ask you about this on drugs so regardless of Republican or Democrat\nAnything that ... or\nThe grades this whole notion of women coming forward to acknowledge their history of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd in this case it feels like in ... she wants to reveal to all of us Sarah Amigo art throwing that out rather frivolously does no good\nTo the whole cause me to cars\nAnd I mean I agree it doesn't um it also doesn't do good for her you know and and so and I think that this is important to point out I mean when charges like this come out they should be taken seriously and that's the whole point of me too is is to take them seriously\nAnd so yeah I think there's a certain responsibility to not throw out baseless charges I Would say that even when you do when people do that and there's always going to be somebody who does that that doesn't mean that when the next person comes forward that you disbelieve them because somebody else with the bad actor\nAnd that type of situation so I think that you know that's important to point out I mean I think I'm willing to agree with Eric that this is a a rookie mistake on her part it's you know ... it's a potentially troubling one what I think she was trying to say was any event that the governor can't\nCarry out his or her duties who do you want in second place so she's trying to make the Sarah Palin argument\nBut she's doing it with an opponent who's running mate is young and healthy you know right I mean the reason why that was an issue which is usually not an issue and and vice presidents on presidential sort of a teams is because the candidate that she was running with was old and had a history of health that she\nStarts so Eric I covered Georgia politics for thirty five years and I don't know the answer to this question she should because you are cheap staffer Georgia governor\nIs that right when the governor leaves the state there's another thing she said but lieutenant governor doesn't take over when the sun actually wherever we're candidate for lieutenant that's not true\nI was surprised by their PR yeah mark who doesn't exactly takeover is the case\nFor lieutenant that's not true yeah I was surprised by that part yeah mark who didn't exactly takeover\nSee it was the case deal would have never\nThought you'd have to answer their times out of style jazz for not knowing the answer to that I don't think we have any like a twenty Fifth Amendment so here and I ... I think that it set it up taking over about lieutenant governor would were built and I think in most people's parents from a significant that unexpected health yeah disaster\nOut well I mean I think it's safe to say\nThat if Sarah Amigo or had the chance to reflect upon that day I think in ... ... ... ... that's right ah she wishes that they had never happened to start over All right let's do this let's get another break either way and come back talk about congressional races right here in Georgia you're listening to political rewind [noise]\nRecently supported gp during our fall fund drive thank you were already putting your dollars to work to bring you the programs that mattered you on the beach if you didn't get a chance to donate during the drive and you were on line contribution now will still make a difference [noise]\nPlease take a couple of minutes to go to G.
