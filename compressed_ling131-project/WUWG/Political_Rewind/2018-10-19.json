is leading political writer Jim Galloway a joins me today he's in the Wednesday and Sunday Edition of the newspaper and then over seas political insider the blog ad\nPolitically Georgia at my AJC dot com Jim\nHow're you doing great I'm great and 'cause I'm especially glad about today 'cause when we have the are two mayors panel it's always fun one of those mayors need is of course Theresa tumbling son of Columbus she's a Democrat although you run as a non partisan night you\nDid your a lame duck session you're a lame duck claimed back ... yeah I you mentioned that earlier and I said who scouting\n[laughter] good\nRental of pour a is with us or on Fridays ah she's a Republican strategist she worked for a governor Sonny Perdue she was his press secretary you\nWere the coach air Carly Fiorina's Georgia campaign plus all your other credentials in politics either right or I could if he asks you to and Sandy Springs mayor rusty Paul is back with us do you run not power to send in St yeah but you're a Republican you\nKnow and and I want to take just a moment because you it's been a while since we've seen you on the show and in between the last time you were on and now my wife and I got to come see a concert at your new city springs venue which isn't all municipal project\nEleven hundred seat theater concern theater a black box\nIt it's it's a remarkable place congratulate\nWell thank you uh when we needed a place where we could come together and build when I called the connective tissue of community and we didn't have that and uh the uh the reaction to the community is very similar to yours I was going to church the other day and I'm used to people ask him even at the\nCommunity and we didn't have that and uh the uh the reaction to the community is very similar to yours I was going to church the other day and I'm used to people asking me even at the altar what's going on Linda rode down and all a lady asked OK here comes as I Love the new none of\nThe well the reaction and I I wanted to even measure they're probably to congratulate you also because I've spent a lot of my time trying to promote how important the arts are to everyday lives and uh and you're venue or does that congratulations okay let's get to work\nOur way we're looking for early voting is underway and and it's really appropriate to start each show with at least a short report on where we stand\n'em as uh the end of the day yesterday\nAnd these numbers include a\nEarly voting in person which began last the last week and a absentee ballots\nThree hundred eighty two thousand nine hundred Georgians had been to the polls across the state which is an increase of a hundred Ninety four percent\n... thousand fourteen midterm only a hundred thirty thousand to one of the Georgia electorate they're done they're over this race yeah yeah so um if we if one of the things we should point out and I want to ask for the uh the mayor's about this um\nIt's exciting Teresa that we see so so many people energized to get out and vote\nBut we don't necessarily know whether these are we certainly don't know whether we we don't know whether this means much because it's just people who are in the habit of voting early\nRight well looks like a couple of things there is some information that we can tell by the ... and it looks like a we're getting a good number about thirty percent of those folks I gave her take on it and in some counties\nBut thirty percent non voters have already that if people did not vote and twenty fourteen to that's a good sign my initial observations are I Believe there's a lot of people who went early to push that button as hard as they could\nUm because they feel very strong so tell us about that whole embassy climates at the same we're at um almost I think it's like a hundred and fifty percent um and so we're we're doing great there's some counties at almost four hundred percent\nAt an early voting that what you see it as one at a moderate everybody's expectations here they are you seeing some of the conservative north Georgia county a voting that two hundred\nThree hundred percent I see in some urban counties that sat two hundred three hundred percent for ...\nService north Georgia county as that two hundred\nThree hundred percent I say in some urban counties that's at two hundred three hundred percent four hundred per cent honest and on Clinton I ended up like that I think they can say that she has worked ... to turn as there is out because you're saying in a very significant increase interest in it are they ... they knew\nAnd in that situation what people are looking for is encouragement and ... that somebody cares and that's what the president coming down does that's what why when we have storms and stuff you don't see me at the storm center you see me communicating with our community but here's what we're doing here's where things are happening here's where the problems are\nBecause that's what people are looking for what they're looking for some hope at that point\nAnd so the most important thing you can give people at that point is hope and then you've got to come in with with help since there's not enough and a Katrina changed the whole dynamic\nOf politics around these major storms and so they changed the deeply because I I mean\nThere's nothing you can do in many cases my dad was a was a Red Cross disaster relief person when Katrina hit he loaded it struck up and was his crew and ready to go and they said stop\nWe have no place to ... we have no food to feed you or you're just simply going to be a drain on resources so sometimes you get help and you can't it it really causes problems so there's that you've got to be able to look at these disasters kind of incrementally the best thing you can do is rather than\nLoading up people in going in there right after a storm is really helped the second responders Red Cross Salvation Army and those folks who are there and but but the president's job the governor's job the mayor's job\nIs to bring hope and let people know that we're doing something we're getting back on our feet and you just hang in there and will will will will will be there\nSo let's talk a little about the political calculation in all this understanding that the people were down there right now have other concerns but but but politics as part of everything in our lives now um\nI think about saying for bishop the Congress Democrat who is one in his district down there which is certainly a powerful district for years and years he's not going to be in jeopardy or he he's a doubt\n... Democrat who is one in his district down there which is certainly a purple districts\nFor years and years he's not going to be in jeopardy or use down there working with people as you as best you can but but if if the president makes a visit and as we move forward say another two weeks to election day and people down there are still living with the kind of despair that we know they are\nGoing to have an impact on elections and all your well\nI think that scenario is going to play out over a longer period of time selection to write so and and the amount of time so when you heard President Trump's if you listen to some of the video when he was down there talking to the farmers\nHe was saying what do you need how can I help you know and they were responding I don't have enough insurance to cover this I don't have you know enough of this that I Need to rebound and so\nYou know part of the reason for him being there too so that when secretary Perdue or one of the other cabinet secretary steps up to him and says we need to issue these grants to south Georgia or we need to issue these loans to south Georgia he understands why and it happened faster and we saw that happen\nSo he immediately went back to shoot you know and it said those loans down approved those loans grants are flowing into Georgia\nSo I think people in this circumstance in particular the farming community down there\nTo care point they're not thinking political sure right\nUm and I think that the electorate in general and Georgia is understanding I mean we've been through that so many times and other circumstances that this is a scenario that is going to play out over time Jim\nBut I'm Sorry did you want to say actually I Will say for example we saw Brian Kemp today announced that he's going to have a three day bus or to go down to south Georgia\nAnd so there's an implication there where he's got to go down and talk to these folks again he's been down there already months since the hurricane and in one capacity and now he's going down there and another capacity to speak with them um and that that part is about getting people to the ...\nI Will tell you what one oh one way to this has helped probably Brian Kemp\nAnd at the end that is a two three four months ago\nWe were all waiting for September October Tobar to see the reaction of farmers\nWhen they do not soybean crop and couldn't send it to to join them money to fuck it that is completely off the table not right I mean that is just a I don't think I heard a single person over the word terrorists down in South Georgia in the last week\nThat's really an another and it strikes me a a ...\nA single person over the word tariffs down in South Georgia in the last week that is really an another it strikes me ah ah for the other way it may help or Brian Kemp is um we all we all thought it was quite likely that\nPresident Trump was going to come down through Georgia and make it part of his rally tour of red states and try to get Brian Kemp up on the stage where they may have one of his typical rallies which of course does fire up to ... to the Republican base but just as powerfully\nFires up the Democrats who don't like Trump\nThis way Kemp sort of get to the benefit of a presidential and vice presidential visit\nA without having to get the downside of those rallies which get so many people would flame\nYeah you know I really think that Trump is so they tend to this cake\nUm and I I agree with what a recipe was saying and that when the president comes even if he's not your guy just one and they're acting like the president for God's sake any any dead and and that's been done\nI don't know that that there's going to be an inmate flooding together Frank can't because Donald Trump that that I think the biggest impact to the election is going to be that many of those democratic counties are without\nPower the ones with the um the largest\nConcentrations of population and that general area I think that's a problem people's lives have been you know uprooted they're just turned upside down some of them in hotels and maybe they've gone to stay with his sister somewhere they're not even there to vote and you know when they will\nBe back and I think that's that disruption is is a real issue for the ... campaign but let me say Stacey had already announced our best to her and says she'll be down there too so again I think you see\nYou know it it's kind of work for each of them in there and you\nReceive can I ask you a different aspect of litter so\nUh in the middle of all this and and I said and introducing the show you know when you notice because you work with many candidates is former chair of the Georgia Republican Party is a former advisor to Jack Kemp\nOr if you got to be so careful in how you speak to you both know that candidates than you and you find yourself saying something that you know just came out of your mouth I Do which is hosted additional all the time\nSo Stacey Abrams is that makes this comment\nShe says we don't want you know we should have more job diversity more job possibilities for the people in Georgia people shouldn't have to work in agriculture and hospitality and\nYou know we should have more job diversity more job possibilities for the people in Georgia people shouldn't have to work in agriculture and hospitality and\nBoy Republicans are counting on that hurt the people just put out another release out today so we're coming down your way at all Stacey Abrams thinks about is the fact that it's unfortunate you're stuck in these industries\nThat are cultures it's bill Georgia's largest single industry\nAnd uh so uh you don't want to be on the wrong side of of that particularly I mean it you know Georgia still is a an extensively rural state in many ways\nA and and they have enormous pride in those rural areas and ah you know they're proud of what they do they're essential not only to our economy but our life [noise]\nSo anything that cast aspersions on the agricultural community in this state\nBut look all I was just a dumb things I mean haven't met one of the reasons I've never run for higher office because you you go and we're like oh and I mean I've told Jim all these years do not report what I say report what I intend to\nIt it is it is a kind of she misspoke she you know and she knew what I mean they did but still you know a lot of video yeah mistakes like that you're getting paid to make it clear what she wanted to say was it's fine to working agriculture or hospitality\nBut if you live in South Georgia those shouldn't be your only two pumps you Brian and that's a that's a that is a that is a message that\nEvery economic developer or in in South Georgia I could get behind yeah up but the problem is you are you're also dealing with a with a with a with a region\nThat's a little bit beleaguered and when you get beleaguered you'd get defensive sure and I'm a I'm sure that's what's so that that's what are the people are calling about driveway and ... well\nYou know to me it kind of think no I I Know that she knows the largest industries in our state I Know that intellectually she noticed that I also know that she has probably than speaking another circle largely about economic mobility as a policy and that sort of a high brow concept that doesn't play well when you're on the stump\nAnd so and I'm speaking out as a party and I'm thinking of somebody that had to learn this myself as an aide to governor cause heart and soul last rats with the land break 'em and who married into farming um that\nAnd this myself as an aide to governor who's heart and soul less rests with the land rush 'em and who married into farming um that you have to walk the walk and you have to be with the people and understand and farming in the state\nIs not just the livelihood farming in the state is a way of life and it is about lineage to all these farms that had been devastated\nMany of these families aren't giving up on farming because they intend to pass it down just as it was passed\nDown to them and in tourism we are recognized and I've learned this from my economic development days we are recognized around the world for our hospitality not only our culture of hospitality but aren't the services we provide we've set up schools to train people to specifically go into the hospitality field\nAnd so you know she really miss stepped on this one and it would show to me is that she just hasn't been out there enough in the trenches they're really talking to people learning\nOn the lower level or something for your memory\nThat I've never had that that particular attitude I think the more people both the merrier let me let me give you an anecdote about Brian and how he has built firewall between the campaign and what's going on for two weeks off\nI Want it in because I had somebody who's looking for him to come visit so I just wanted to ... states obviously I spent some time dumped capitals y'all know\nAnd I went in and said this is talk of the schedule and I said when I talk to them and they said I don't want it was about in this well we can't talk to you about that you need to call these people cause that's being done over there and we don't do that here\nAnd so do you have to have a firewall between what's going on in ... states office on a day to day basis in the campaign so he has built some protections in there and so that that those kinds of overlaps which was unusual to do what grocery he hasn't hasn't elaborated on them\nSome protections in there and so that that those kinds of overlaps which one but I'm not an unusual will tell you what was the he hasn't he hasn't elaborated on the media's not verbalize that firewall no\nThat's it that's it there and that high stakes are ... why can't that that's I mean that's exactly how it was on governor Davis running for office at the at someone on the governing side you get not talk about anything that had to do with the campaign and vice versa\nI got to get to another break but before I Do I understand all of these arguments but I Would suggest this\nOr whether it's this week next week or a November six there are people who will go to the polls and vote against Stacey Abrams because they are farmers are hospitality workers who thinks she insulted them and they're furious were there for doing it\nAnd there will be people who will vote against Brian Kemp because they think he is manipulated his use of the secretary's day job is\nTo hold down votes so perception\nBecomes incredibly important we all agree with that I guess right\nNow are are they new voters okay [laughter] I knew\nIt would have to get in the la [laughter] we're gonna take it out or break and we'll be right back in\n\nTime I read Plato or this week on science friday a sleep scientists fills the beans on ... one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles of the

P. B. dot org slash community for reservations Tuesday October thirtieth\nSeven P. M. we really Jim we have so much fun in Savannah and the coastal league of women voters really really get excited about\nAnd the house and and now it's you know you almost feel like you're important and I wouldn't want to go that far but\nWe're going to have to watch what we say spontaneously down there right I Want to turn to one another matter that has to do with this whole question of you know so called voter suppression gym or we know that the other day we talked about this on Wednesday show Jefferson County had a strange incident where a senior citizen\nA set or tried to get people on a bus so they could go vote early on the bus was turned back\nBy county officials who believed it was a partisan exercise being led by a democratic uh official in the party in the county the seniors we get off the bus you'll have to vote some other time Stacey Abrams\nShe went out and saw those folks you know you're very very modest [laughter]\nI mean I mean she she went on to the ... is it a ... percent\nTo see those folks she happened to bring a couple of network cameras and and and and it all worked out for her but it did it did it did kind of feed what what you were saying earlier is that is that is that democratic message of of of data of they'd rather not see you vote\nWhich is intended to make you want to vote even harder yeah\nI'm All right I'm\nFull get off the governor's race a couple of quick notes uh Loretta yeah on Monday Marco Rubio is going to be in Cobb County voting voting for supporting a camp they'll rally with camp and according Booker is going to be here in Atlanta on Sunday for a Stacey Abrams um\nAny kind of thoughts about Rubio as opposed to book or any bookers kind of held up\nFor a Stacey Abrams um any kind of thoughts about ... as opposed to book or any bookers kind of\nHeld up as this liberal ... by Republicans\nWhereas you know Marco Rubio he did he use the guy who talked about Trump small hands where do you make of\nYou know I mean look you know\nWell if you're going to look at where they are and the partisan spectrum Cory Booker certainly is to the left\nOn the part isn't spectrum and he demonstrated such during recent hearing 'em and Marco Rubio has been more of a centrist he's very conservative socially but uh when it comes to foreign policy um and other issues he's very central he's in Cobb County because he won Cobb County when he was running for\nPresident Democrats who say that uh that Cory Booker was a hero in the middle or dirt two numbers but explain everything here okay one number is twenty twenty [noise] the other number twenty twenty four\nHour right okay so so so they're both making they're they're they're they're they're they're making bones with with the people that they have to make if they want to have a chance to go ahead and and and I would say that that this is a smart play by the Kemp campaign because\nThis is the ... if if camp is going to camp is weak in the northern parks in the verbs Marco Rubio is the perfect person to rally Republican voters\nWell he also is very close to Jeff Duncan Jeff Duncan when he played run the Florida Marlins they were very close friends are you going to be overly cargo to write down the street I may you know I Try not to cross the river bad things happen but I\nMake an exception countries which Stacey Abrams with all this\nYou know I've never been event with her but I've done some things certainly I'm trying to do my part for the campaign and the cars\nYou know I'm I Will say when it comes to a ... Marco Rubio or or Cory Booker they're just playing to their base getting its national attention it's all fun it makes it the battle days Georgia and the national discussion that's great\nBut I have to say something about you what you just left related to the Jefferson County by smoking things exactly what I was talking about about the one man one vote let's expand the electorate make sure everybody votes versus oh we can't be so partisan now here\nI you know there are those people were adults that this was not a daycare center and a and they want to it was ... it was a non\nIt's versus oh we can't be so partisan now here\nI you know there are those people were adults that this was not a daycare center and I and they want to it was ... it was a non profit organization that that but the fact that there was somebody involved that maybe it's all the Democratic party but that bus shutdown\nWas it was deemed to be partisan strategic effort because it was an African American\nI mean there's no question there was a symbol of this whole notion of whether there's been voter suppression alright look let's change the subject of higher early do we all agree that the amount of time we spend paying attention to this election cycle to the Trump White house to the Congress fighting day and night\nUsually means we really need to drink more\nAnd there were you specially wish we could drink earlier on Sunday and that is\nThe subject but both of you and your cities are going to address the ... brand or the most or whatever you wanted to mandate to most of the mandate first of all what does it do essentially this basically this uh this allows of restaurants\nTo serve alcoholic beverages with meals before noon yeah correct in the earlier so windy minutes ... minutes earlier remembering that when ... when did we allow Sunday liquor sales of any kind of it's been within the last decade I mean\nI Am trying to I'm trying to remember it's been a little longer than that haven't been by I tell you what if there's nothing that symbolizes the change current and Georgia that there is not\nPitchforks and torches ah about drinking is that I mean this was this was the fields of Christian Coalition leader is this a top issue for years and years and years and that's what I wanted to ask you both the the the the climate has changed entirely has", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "19"}
