I. editor in chief the founder I figure all the titles a and B at Georgia health\nNews and we should point out that one of the reasons Kyle is here on a on today is because in his day job he works on health care policy issues of for a think tank\nIn Washington and we're also joined this time in Atlanta by the AJC is Washington Post reporter Tamar ... who just literally stepped off a plane to be in Atlanta or to cover the last week of the elections in Georgia\nRight only show in person and you're not even here to the\nCrowd that the airports agree rather [laughter] I'm all\nRight as I said health care has become\nOne of the most significant issues certainly in the Georgia governor's race but also in races especially congressional races across the country it's interesting that literally in the minutes before\nWe went on the air I turned you a political on my ... on my laptop\nAnd the lead story is a picture of Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp standing together in the debate they did it at our studios last week\nAnd the headline says red state governor races could bring Medicaid expansion to millions so this is a subject that it's very much on the minds of Georgians as it is on voters in other states as well so with all that in mind why don't\nThe Medicaid expansion I've seen various figures but they kind of seemed to land around about two hundred and fifty million dollars a year\nTo do Medicaid expansion that money would bring in three billion dollars in federal ...\nUsing the federal marriage a Kevin Stacey Abrams has been quoted as saying she thinks her plan would probably cost the state about three hundred million and she says\nKind of vaguely that she would pay for that through a a ... taking back money from a charity care in some communities that she probably has talked about other programs they could get the money back from but I haven't heard much about that from her\nAll the best line she's had though right is the line where she said why if someone who came up to you and said if you give me one dollar I'll give you nine right which is the ratio and and I think that that had sort of drives at home\nAnd I you know in a way the Republicans you know from the beginning we're very anti Affordable Care act anti that as they turned it Obamacare and I think uh the the whole thing got caught up in in that we're\nWe've seen a change in the polls right any I mean and Tamar where people were against Obamacare that but they were for key provisions of it and now that leaving shifted now they're in Georgia more people are for our health\nCARE Act is more popular than ever before especially the provision for pre existing conditions that's always poll very well America's so\nI I okay let me ask what I I Am I grant you it may be a very naive question Medicaid expansion what is why do we think that suddenly as many as Seventy\nPercent of Georgians what Medicaid expansion is that like I see bumper stickers that or give me a a very clear quick message if you expand Medicaid you'll better fit in this way or that way\nIt is it is it altruism I Know you don't pull for this sort of thing Kevin but ... why his Medicaid expansion helping the poor students\nIs it is it altruism I Know you don't poll for this sort of thing Kevin but water George why his Medicaid expansion helping the poorest of Georgians get coverage what's driven it's so high up ... study buddy you have any speculation about that\nI mean one thing that's been interesting is they I think people and you know I think things really started to change last year when\nRepublicans in Congress got very serious about repealing the Affordable CARE Act and I think people finally realize oh I could lose something think it's a little different in Georgia where they didn't expand Medicaid but when we talk about something like pre existing conditions\nIn a way that has been really helpful to my family and in my pocket but when you want to take that away from me that's an argument you heard from Republicans when Congress was initially debating the Affordable CARE Act it's it's really hard to take something away from people when they get it\nYou know ... uh Kyle it sounds as if maybe that's what part of this is is that\nObamacare itself became more popular the notion of preexisting conditions which are going to talk about in a few minutes a suddenly became more popular so maybe Medicaid just rode along with the overall sudden increase in popularity of a CIA [noise]\nI think the other thing to add is that Medicaid does provide good coverage for people who are on it there's almost two million people in Georgia who are on the Medicaid program in the state and research that has looked at Medicaid expansion\nHas shown improvements in self rated health status having a doctor I'm an expansion states like Kentucky and Arkansas versus non expansions to non expansion state in Texas and you\nActually wrote a piece on just said subject how ... how important medicate is for for ... poor people who with out it forego many of the most important health services that they should be taking advantage of\nLow low income adults and expansion states states that have expanded Medicaid\nThey tend to be reported to be in better health they have fewer on ... medical needs they don't skip doses of medication or versus as compared to these low income adults in states like Georgia that have not expanded Mary I\nWant to go back a for a couple of more minutes before we move on to another aspect of health care to the to a camp wants to do because there is in ... another important provision that we sort of touched on lightly but I think we should help our listeners me for that matter understand a little better a camp talks about waivers we\nBe sure that we sort of touched on lightly but I think we should help our listeners me for that matter understand a little better\nA camp talks about waivers we mentioned that before and one of the waivers he says would be important to Georgia is very similar to what they did in Wisconsin which is a program that the feds would allow the state to\nUse some two hundred million dollars in is this is what we talk about when we talk about reinsurance I think Andy for people this would be subsidies for people on the exchanges though Obamacare exchanges right\nWell this would help insurers are this reinsurance ground this would help insurers pay for really high cost medical care right in other words those individuals that may have a cancer or a heart condition that racks up really high bills\nReinsurance would have a pool of money for insurers to recoup some of those expenses in those high dollar individual patient cases\nFor the most important thing right that the waivers to\nThe Andy air that it gives gives political cover instead of expanding Medicaid politicians are able to say well we're not doing it the feds aren't telling us how to do this we're gonna do it in a\nUniquely George away or they uniquely Wisconsin way and wave or could we talked about it before it came on the show could mean almost anything right\nRight it could mean the Georgia chamber of Congress plan which looked a lot like Medicaid expansion of course they didn't call it that they called it I Can't even remember what they called it but they they had work requirements for beneficiaries who would gain coverage but essentially look pretty much like Medicaid expansion\nPack grade he has a waiver idea that's more targeted to uninsured in Atlanta ah and but there are waivers all different types that they need special federal permission in order to go ahead and pursue them\nBut Kyle a while it sounds like it could be very important for people with high who who do have significant health issues that are paying higher rates because of it and by the way we were still kid into preexisting conditions at a couple of minutes\nThe waiver that camp is describing is not an answer to expanding Medicaid because it doesn't it doesn't expand the number of people in Georgia who would suddenly be eligible for Medicaid\nOr to expanding Medicaid because it doesn't it doesn't expand the number of people in Georgia who would suddenly be eligible for Medicaid\nThat's correct so there's basically two kinds of waivers that I think are central to this debate a waiver in Medicaid which is what some other states have used to expand their Medicaid program\nAnd then this waiver for reinsurance that we're talking about the campus proposing I'm Stacey Abrams is also basically proposing the same idea in this instance and so um this waiver a squarely targeted at people who buy insurance on the Affordable CARE Act health insurance exchanges and bringing more stability to that market\nA man it is not a solution to Medicaid or ... in my opinion it's also not a solution to the ... of\nHealthcare in rural Georgia because this problem is just different than the problem that you're experiencing in rural Georgia\nUm before we get to our break we we are coming into the enrollment season Andy and so we now in Georgia have for insurers across the state if I got that right\nRight do we have for insurers are but they're not all across ... said there are in different regions yeah but it's the same for us we had last\nYear so one of the things that's interesting about this as people go to ah to the website to the federal website to sign up they're going to notice what the rates are this year and of course I'd tomorrow last year when Congress was debating the abolition of a ca the warnings were\nA prolific that people were going to pay more and more money that the system was falling apart that ... your costs for being insured we're gonna continue to increase that was a big reason they sold to Americans the fact that they should be overturned wasn't\nExactly you heard a lot of Republicans talking about Iraq and ... and for many years that that was ... we saw that on the exchange it had that was what was pretty remarkable is that they fear and at least two of our for insurance in in Georgia I mentioned that rates will go down slightly\nYeah I was interested in reading the Kaiser Family foundation report on this which we had a post on our Twitter account a Robert will will get that out so people can look at it in Georgia the silver plan is a plan you believe we should look at a first and foremost writer Andy\nLow cost silver plan is is basically the benchmark plan\nSo people are\nIf we should look at first and foremost right Andy\nLow cost silver plan is is basically the benchmark plan\nRight so people are going to pay a bit more on the silver plan they're going to pay about forty bucks more than they were if they had the bronze plan they're actually got to pay less and the goal play I think there are costs go up only\nAbout any ... about up to about seven percent so it these are increases but they're not the\nSort of a terrible terrible crisis moments so that we were told by Republicans were happened\nRight here or go don't forget that we had like fifty percent increase in premiums but\nPool yeah and the other part about it of course is that I mean in the end it going all the way back to when President Obama you know push this through the debate was really about\nDid we have the obligation as a country and us taxpayers to make sure everybody who wanted health insurance could have it or\nWas it more look people are on their own it ought to fend for themselves and that sort of that bill Gates's new government mandate government's not can't solve every problem and it was sort of those two debates now it's sort of really more than changed into a much more complicated situation\nUm is there anything else I'm trying to figure out I think we've covered preexisting conditions fairly well I Will say this is Kevin\n... and I I don't like to make this show about us as in the media very often\nAh although I did yesterday I think it's because this week I'm feeling a particularly the wrath of the president who seems to blame the media for what happened in Pittsburgh over the weekend um and I I grant you I may not be being fair to him and but it does hurt a\nSo here's where the media plays such a crucial role if you have people who voted against AC a against individual mandates against preexisting conditions in Congress over and over where else are people going to learn the reality of that\nIt's against the individual mandates against preexisting conditions in Congress over and over where else are people going to learn the reality of that or the nuances and grant you there are some nuances in terms of the Republican plan here or there except through journalism guests Kevin\nOh I Would agree in fact one of the things that I Believe and I don't think I could prove that says that\nThe reason that certain\nThat the idea of expanding Medicaid and the Affordable CARE Act have become more popular is because the more media coverage as a people have learned about things they become more insightful they understand the issue better\nAnd they're demanding more of their politicians and their leaders because they ... they they understand the complicated problem better\nBecause we've spent so much time covering it\nKind of let me ask you a a this doesn't have to do specifically what the campaign and a promises and policies that are part of the election but when Congress decided to eliminate the individual mandate why\nDidn't Obamacare just start to collapse that and why is it that the exchanges are able to in some cases reduce the cost of insurance this year in other cases make very small increases what now is keeping this whole program up and running\nI think um [noise] it really has to do with their financial assistance that comes along with the policies and they Affordable Care act so it was sort of as a carrot and stick approach and the carrot and a help getting a health insurance plan if you have\nIncome under four times the poverty line [noise] um that is enough of an incentive along with having health coverage of having a little bit of\nSecurity and peace of mind about your financial situation as it relates to your health those things I think continued to drive\nWhy people want health coverage and I think\nUm what you see from voters as that they just want\nYou know the the part of some stuff to go away and for politicians to come together and make policy that just get this right\nAnd it appears Andy in terms of what ... saying that Americans have not\nSuggested that they really want so skinny plans that offer them minimal coverage and exclude any number of conditions they seem to be going into the exchanges and buying the full full deal\nRight and we expect you to big\nA member of conditions they seem to be going into the exchanges and buying the full full deal\nRight and we expected a big drop off in the exchange uh this ... this past year but we didn't get it was pretty close to the same number well over four hundred thousand Georgian signed up\nAnd uh I I think it I think it is about preexisting conditions in the sense that just about every family has somebody in that family with some kind of health condition and people get that they get it on an emotional level but they also get it on a financial level if they lose that coverage\nAll right we're we only got a couple of minutes left for this discussion but as I think through what we have talked about and what what I have a neglected to bring up there is one issue that I have not brought up that I Do think deserves at least a couple of minutes before we move on today Stacey Abrams says from day one\nShe'll go for Medicaid expansion now she clarify she knows that she can't go in and inside that executive order establishing the Medicaid expansion she says she'll start working on it if she's elected from day what [noise]\nBut the legislature a few sessions ago decided to take the uh control of Medicaid expansion out of the hands of the governor and put it in the hands of the legislature with a Republican legislature\nUh Andy why does she think that she can get them to expand Medicaid when it's been a ... to so many Republicans in Georgia\nFive think two things are at play I mean she told me in an interview that that she felt that there were there to actually a lot of Republicans came up to her and told her that we wish we could do Medicaid expansion but the the political landscape uh in other words the leadership in the state\nAnd I was saying no to it so I think she feels like there's more a pent up Republican desire to do this [noise]\nAnd and I will I Will also say that ah it could be that if she is elected that there could be a compromise with Republicans in the sense of adopting work requirements for anybody who would be a beneficiary these low income adults would have to fulfill\nThe work requirement in order to get this new expanded Medicaid coverage I mean some states have done that\nUh it cuts down certainly on the number of people who get the uh the new Medicaid benefits but it's ... it could be a middle ground that she\nCertainly on the number of people who get the uh the new Medicaid benefits but it's ... it could be a middle ground that she could strike with Republicans that could make it work\nBill things about about the politics I think what Andy suggesting on the work requirement\nGoes ... would give the Republicans some cover that they may need ... Republicans who might be looking to uh to this to solve some of the states uh problems and then I think it would be more accurate to say helped me here that Governor deal\nMore or less a sent it to the legislature being having control of whether or not to expand Medicaid well what I mean I Know they had to pass the bill and everything but the message was clear that we're going to make this is hard to do is we can't I\nMean that's my point of by the way I think establishing a worse condition might in fact when some Republicans over by Stacey Abrams wants to pass a Medicaid expansion\nShe better make sure she better be careful about that because unless you can pass it with all Republican votes tomorrow they're going to be Democrats in the legislature will hear nothing about a work requirement for Medicaid\nSo sure that they're still in the minority and it looks like they they will be even after they put like a political position that would play out of it right yeah I mean I I I don't I bill I don't see it that way I think it would be very hard for a Democrat in the Georgia legislature to argue against expanding Medicaid or they could\nPut it to a referendum and unlike like Idaho and Nebraska are doing and and give it to the voters does\nAll right we are pretty much out of time uh Kyle as you sit up there in Washington and work on a health care issues for the things that you're associated with anything last thing we need to address here with about a minute we have left\nSo I think the one I just to add a little to this discussion on work requirements and Medicaid at work or comments I don't think are a condition for getting Medicaid in a red state Republicans have\nAccepted Medicaid expansion in the past without a work requirement\nBy another piece of leverage potentially for governor Abrams over a Republican administration if you don't get through this next year\nI'm is a tax bill that passed last year that cuts tax cuts income taxes and the state by two steps the second step in that tax cut requires a joint resolution from the legislature and the governor to sign that that may be a piece of land\nThat's income taxes in this state by two steps the second step in that tax cut requires a joint resolution from the legislature and the governor to sign that that may be a piece of legislation and she looked at that time it really hasn't\nGone anywhere I could get some bargaining power All right let's see if we are completely out of time for this discussion Kevin Riley Andy Miller ... thank you so much\nFor being part of this conversation by the way if you don't think that conservatives want Medicaid expansion\nWe almost have never agreed with one of our favorite tweeters Ted bar field but tend bar field just set us a tweet saying it's not a popular sentiment and tough to sell politically\nBut folks with the expense of preexisting conditions need a public option and not insurance they essentially need trance fear for payments but he's all for basically\nThe expansion of Medicaid for preexisting conditions All right Ted\nWe got on the same page Cruz's political rewind we'll be right back\nOn the next ...
