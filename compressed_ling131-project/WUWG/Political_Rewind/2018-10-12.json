dead heat if she wins a bruise becomes Georgia's first democratic governor in Fifteen Years\nAre the issues she believes will turn this red state purple\nDoes she contends with characters too\nFor Georgia Abrams joins us on political rewind\nI\nDo like to thank so much for being with us for political rewind today um we have a very special guest is you know democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Evans so we want to get right down to the questions\nAh but first let me introduce Jim Galloway he's the lead political writer a bus or the AJC and a is a regular here on Mondays and Fridays you also you read them on Wednesdays and Sundays in the dead three edition of\nThe uh AJC any overseas the political in sight or blockage immigrate to have you here for ... well before the fall and who is GDP is legislative a correspondent a wider to be here today I I assume that in the last\nYear or so you've you've covered bitter Stacey Abrams down at the state capital for\nHer yes indeed I think everybody is talking about the governor's\nAnd as we get started if I could tell the guy or the folks in the control room that were there we go we're getting kind of bad feedback we only want to share our voices one Sunday she oh today Welcome\nStacey Abrams it's a real pleasure to have you here thank you for having me I Do need to point out as I have when we've promoted the show before we did invite Brian Kemp\nTo also appear on political rewind his campaign said he was not going to do it but he doesn't have enough time I talked to Bryan about it personally and he basically said the same thing uh so imitation which the extended to him and we're glad you accept that\nStock issues check\nYou said over and over that you're going to in fact say ... perhaps that Medicaid expansion is the most crucial certainly right up there in the top couple of issues in your campaign [noise] um [noise]\nWhat is Medicaid expansion really mean what should people know about that\nThe top couple of issues in your campaign waters Medicaid expansion really me and what should people know about that sort of but some of the challenges you may have to deal with if you're elected on that score\nFill it let's um set the stage right now in the state of Georgia we spend about one point seven billion dollars on people who are sick\nBut can't afford health insurance and he'll go and get health care anyway\nAnd when I say we have I mean every single Jordan when your property taxes go up when you pay income tax you're paying for those folks because our health care system in America is based on health insurance\nMedicaid expansion was part of the Affordable CARE Act one part credit the exchanges so more people could buy private insurance for those who are considered to poor for existing Medicaid but\nWho who make too much for existing Medicaid but we are too poor for private insurance\nMedicaid expansion said we're going to provide them access to insurance as well because that will cover their cost and actually reduce the costs for everyone in the state of Georgia that means four hundred and Seventy three thousand people who make more than seven thousand dollars and less than roughly Seventeen thousand dollars\nAnd a lot of these are working people who have one or two jobs but they don't get health insurance from their employers they would be eligible for Medicaid\nIf we accept Medicaid expansion the state of Georgia puts in one dollar we draw down nine dollars but when all in that's two hundred and fifty million from the state and we drove down three billion dollars with that money recover four hundred and Seventy three thousand Georgians with health insurance we create fifty six thousand jobs [noise]\nSixty percent of which are outside of Metra Atlanta\nAnd we see a six billion dollar economic output through the state of Georgia\nSo as you know governor deal or rejected or expanding Medicaid on the basis bad in the long run it would cost Georgia too much money I'm ... years of the Fed's pay for the bulk of it for a number of years but eventually the state will take over more and more of the obligation\nThat really that's not true okay so so that it's true in fact but not the reality is what started out was that if we done this in fourteen that the feds would have paid one hundred percent because we're now down to the feds paying Ninety three percent but the cat is it the feds will always pay at least Ninety percent\nAnd so we've already missed the moment where we were going to have to pay more so when I'm Talking about is the worst case scenario we're putting in one dollar and drawing down nine dollars it used to be we put a nothing and we do down ten dollars\nTo let me ask you you have\nTalking about is the worst case scenario we're putting in one dollar and drawing down nine dollars it used to be we put a nothing and we do down ten dollars\nYou know let me ask you you have the Medicaid expansion is being held by by many people who are really worried about rural Georgia yeah and and and the state of healthcare up there and you were in a political season and the political weight of Georgia is above I twenty how do you get\nSo I Want to turn to another one of the big priorities that you've been discussing that education you will um first of all you have made it clear that uh if you become governor the hundred million dollars that the legislature is set aside to provide scholarships essentially\nFor students and to go into a non public settings eyes grown away you don't want to continue that you want to put your focus on public education my correct\nI Believe that public dollars should be spent for public education okay um so you also have what I guess I Would call a holistic approach a ... ... ... ... you know Mr Abrams certainly\nGalloway and I and ... are a little more recently we've all watched the governor's for many many years with education reform plans if you have two and a governor comes along and proposes a plan that extreme changes add up\nTo tell us what this holistic approach ... you're discussing here looking at it as an entire communities ability to engage with students in a way that we wouldn't necessarily consider the academic approaches that a fair way of saying I think\nIt's a fair way of saying it and it comes about in part because of the hard work I did working with Governor deal and\nThe legislature and sometimes in opposition when it came to the opportunity school district we know that the current funding formula it's inadequate I'm proud that it was finally fully funded this year but it was written forty years ago for a very different student body from very different state\nWe know it's more expensive to educate children who come from low income homes to speak English as a second language a special needs are we live in rural communities and therefore we have to update our formula to reflect his knowledge\nFirst or you were saying you will take on a asking the legislature to redo crawl over you basically education which\nGovernor deal it said it was going to do and never realized that\nSaying you will take on a asking the legislature to redo ...\nWhich governor deal with so it was going to do and never realized that he was going to have a hard time doing it\nAnd it's going to be difficult but it's necessary because we have certain counties that are donor counties that have changed since composition and are unable to meet their basic responsibilities plus we have a different student base than we did before and we're very we're much larger state\nAnd so I Believe that we have to tackle this we don't need to do another commission or we I was there when governor Perdue did his commission when governor ... a deal that his commission I think we have a commission information for the next job implementation and thinking about how do you craft the legislation that actually reflects the best values\nBut holistic education is critically important because if a child comes to class on Monday and the last time they ate was on friday late in the best teacher can't teach that child\nAnd we know that we have to think about the whole needs as a child mental health criminal issues health care issues transients one of the issues that Atlanta has tackled and the school districts where children are moving from apartment to apartment every thirty days because their parents can find affordable housing\nThese are not solutions that have to be isolated from one another and I think Atlanta and Marietta have both come up with really innovative ways to start to address these issues what I'm saying is we have to bring the solutions together public private partnerships aren't just for infrastructure building it's how we build the best and strongest aside\nIs their approach to attach to your approach to public education\nThere is I think long term there will be a different price tag no we have today I Do not know exactly what it is because I think part of it as figuring out how much can the public sector provide what responsibilities can we ask the nonprofit sector to contribute to work in the private sector step and where it has not\nBut I Do know that we have to make this a priority we are losing the race in the state of Georgia we had a great graduation rate but we still have too many kids who do not achieve at the levels and at the milestones we need them to hit\nFor this to be a strong sustainable educational system for kids but\nWe um ... told me we've got to get a very short break a thirty second break out of the way so we're going to do that right now and come back we're more with democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams\nOf getting rid of your old car truck van or RV usually these big will donation program here to help donating has never been easier will take care of everything including re pick up of your vehicle is good at ... dot org slash cars or call\nAnd donating has never been easier we'll take care of everything including ... of your vehicle is good at ... dot org slash cars or call a seven seven maybe one\nCar back\nYou're listening to our\n[noise]\nWelcome back to political ... joined today by your attorney oh candidate Stacey Abrams which is a real pleasure to have you here since it happened and we've already gotten some notes from various people out there on Facebook and Twitter you as soon as I said it'd be they're gonna show we did invite her opponent Brian Kemp to appear as well the ... campaign took advantage of our invitation\nThe ... campaign did not Jim gallery you got a question\nFor the journal constitution and gentle do actually new news has a new poll out this week\nUh speeds in horse race terms that shows sill shows you as you and Mr camping in a dead heat within the margin of error of each other there are a couple of aspects that are very interesting but I think\nHe is leaning against a among go male voters who teach me to forty three percent nearly ling among women voters with two point four percent which which in in in talking with with other Democrats whose kids that's a number of the needs to be improved upon and at the core of that\nIs you've got white female voters still a number one uh\nExpressing approval for Donald Trump I mean this is after me too and this is after the Kavanaugh hearings and with sixty four percent of giving them an approval rating sixty four percent Kemp they're giving in ... there are there going for camp by sixty nine percent [noise]\nHow do you address that in the next three weeks ...\nThat polls are good roadmap that they are not predict as\nIf you look around the country like if you look around the country we've had races that had been decided this year by margins that were unexpected including my own race and my primary and what I Know is the polls tell us what's possible and they tell us places where we can improve\nBut we are not running a race that had they single scenario idea I'm Talking to everyone everywhere I've been to a hundred and fifty nine counties we're reaching out to communities that rarely hear from candidate but we're doing so in a way that's consistent that same conversations I was having at the beginning\nWhere I've been to a hundred and fifty nine counties we're reaching out to communities that rarely hear from candidates but we're doing so in a way that's consistent the same conversations I was having at the beginning of the campaign I'm having them now I haven't pivoted I haven't had to soften or just my image I've been able to run a consistent campaign and that is why we're in within the margin of error together\nBut going forward I'm going to continue to do the work necessary to actually turned out or voters that is how you win by turning out voters in every community of every stripe\nOn on one of the issue questions do you do see asked on on on who do do do best with health care\nI mean clearly you have spoken more about health care and Medicaid expansion of you know maybe maybe on the ratio of nine to one over over Mr Kemp and your voters voters pretty much our our guard down the line ... an equal number so ... would be a would be better\nAt the ... menu [noise]\nDo you how to address but by how do you how do you how do you go from from I guess from tone to eleven twelve\nManagement I again I I take every poll with the seriousness that I should\nBut I also recognize that when I'm Down in ... county when I'm over in Stuart counting the number of people who are turning out to have these conversations who've never voted\nWho've never been engaged and they're turning out at record numbers in part because they're not included in a lot of these polls they are not the voters who are considered likely voters so they're not being added into this narrative\nAnd that's part of the way we win by having this conversation with everyone I don't doubt that people see both of us and use their ideological backgrounds to decide where they said but the responsibility of every good campaign and the responsibility I take on as a future leader of the state of Georgia is I've got to talk to everyone\nEvery day about health care about education about jobs I Want to go back ... joy ...\nIs also very very important to you the partnership between police and community and went through Rogers wants to know what are your plans for increasing police accountability in addition what are your thoughts on the civilian review board to investigate police misconduct and brutality\nWhen it comes to the partnership with law enforcement as deputy city attorney I was responsible sometimes\nFor writing the rules that were implemented by the police and so I have a very deep respect for law enforcement and if you look at my record I've worked hard to maintain a focus on public safety and has helped get good done\nBut I also understand that there's a higher responsibility on our law enforcement that hasn't been met\nMaintain a focus on public safety and has helped get good done but I also understand that there's a higher responsibility on our law enforcement that hasn't been met in some places\nAnd people are worried that is why my criminal justice reform plan includes community safety as part of that conversation we've got to reconnect our communities to law enforcement and they have to be held accountable that's why I worked with rich go like the Republican chairman\nOf the judiciary non civil committee to pass legislation that actually held our law enforcement to a higher standard they were no longer allowed to access\nThe grand jury process without impunity as they had been previously and I want to continue to do that work I Want to continue the work that I'm governor deal began with post training that training that all of our law enforcement has to go through\nThat training has to include sensitivity training but also include diversity training and it can't be a one shot deal it's gotta be repetitive\nAnd there has to be consequences civil civilian review board I think makes sense but it's a local issue because most of these are locally held\nI of my own volition gotten my own car and drove myself around the state meet those folks and to talk about their needs and this campaign I have grounded our campaign and issues and values and talking to every George and I can find\nAnd because of that I'm One Seventy six percent of the primary hundred and fifty three counties thirty eight thousand donors to my campaign at least five times the number of individual donors from Georgia to my opponent has and I am very proud of each and every one of those donations because those are individuals who heard my message here in Georgia and believe that this is the right way to go\nI talk about Georgia across the country because Georgia's a national state we want to be a national leader\nThe current governor ... being the number one place to do business no one's coming here if they don't know about us and I'm going to do the best job I can to to shout about how great Georgia is across the country I've met with studio heads and California and New York because we bring their jobs here a hundred thousand film jobs\nMy question is why hasn't brand kept taking the lead and talking to those folks we can get a hundred thousand more here I talked to investors about bringing jobs to Georgia my question is why\nFilm jobs my question is why hasn't brand kept taking the lead and talking to the sub so we can get a hundred thousand more here I talked to investors about bringing jobs to door to my question is why isn't brand kept doing the same thing I Believe that leadership comes from how you behave not when you have the job but what you're willing to do to get the job and I wanted to go across the country\nCheerleading about Georgia to make certain that not only that I went but that George is the number one state in the country the dad become governor last question what is your message take these next two weeks to Miami rural Georgia of women or minority women yes\n[laughter] I said\nJust a just a real softball or what are your days like how much sleep are you getting\nAbout four hours a night and I we we this morning I think I started at six am uh we'll be going until late tonight I may find myself on another national show talking about issues here in Georgia which one should we be looking at I don't know I I just work here [laughter]\nMy point is less I I I I Love Georgia I was raised in Mississippi but I grew up here I came here when I was in high school and I chose to make George my home I spent the last Twenty years working for Georgia\nI spent the last Twenty years building a life here making certain that I was hiring Georgians creating jobs for Georgians but also doing the work of serving Georgia and I think the values I bring face and family and service and um responsibility that those are Georgia values and that's why I'm asking every Jordan to consider me and to give me their\nVotes human lives so I think we just heard a closing argument that we may hear more young ones between now and November ... thank you so much for joining us today we've enjoyed having you are in for a way out for us what you'd like to do for the state thank you for having a marriage that the question for\nYou to take a a very quick break and when we come back Lisa and Jim Will stay with me or we're going to talk a little bit about\nOther news in politics right now this is political reward [noise]\nWere you thinking of

good a GBDs outward slash cars or call a seven seven P.

P. B. and CPB news dot org\n[noise]\nWelcome back to political rewind or I'm joy and for the last segment of the show by lease Haram who's covered the legislature for Georgia Public broadcasting for the last what two three years to say I shouldn't have to lie and my Monday in front of your partner on the show Jim Galloway a V. AJC uh\nStacey Abrams Jim are you and I especially in at least a yo weigh in on this as well we've seen a lot of candidates for governor come and go and again I ... I was asked me to repeat it again yes Brian campus been invited to do the show and you know what I Hope he's still says yes I'll come in but so far they haven't\nThought she really has her message\nDoubting that she has her message down pat at times um uh if ... if I'm putting on a campaign managers hats I'm I'm\nWondering whether she would be better off simplify and some of that message she's I mean she gets she gets she's such a policy won't get since it's so deeply into the weeds\nThat that that sometimes the the the impact of the message is is is lost a meditation explaining it\nOn their websites and leave pulled out of their their campaign pay they didn't even think that's a really intense and in third world America the Medicaid\nExpansion is is ... is one of those issues or it's it's a it's a very complicated issue and you're trying to break through a ... someone's view on on on the low income people on on geography and uh you\nKnow and maybe maybe to simplify that message to just simply said my hospital\n... I don't know if they have and even as a legislator was very very thorough no matter what he tackled that's uh that's who she is that there is she right\nUm well it was good to have her here talking about her ah the issues that battered her Jim let's go back up because you you went through the numbers pretty quickly but you do that\nWell it was good to have her here are talking about her ah the issues that battered her Jim let's go back because you you went through the numbers pretty quickly but you did have an important poll yesterday you in a W. S. B. T. V. conducted by the University of Georgia right\nSample size twelve hundred plus yeah that's a big deal a margin of error is down to two point eight which allows you to to to dip into a lot of sub groups and ... so I\nKnew that there isn't that the margin of error there I mainly really our neck and neck ... if\nIt's a we've got some forty eight forty six and a two point eight margin of error or a ... statistically meaningless\nHere you are you wrote a column which is what I really want to drill down on for a few minutes thought on I I Do something and you ask Stacey Abrams about but I I'd ask you to go back and kind of talk to us about it again your most recent column is about the women at how the women were polled\nInvited as it does or service this isn't Sunday's paper here and and if you look at it it's it's there are there are plenty of of numbers there that if you're Stacey Abrams you're you're you're encouraged a if you Brian Kemp you're encouraged but on the on the Abrams side\nIf you look at the the gender breakdown of support for Abrams fifty point four percent uh this is a this is a ticket with two women at the top well she's running with Sarah exam Amigo\nOr she is a we've got two female candidates are running a Democrats running for PFC against Republican incumbents have two female candidates running for the sixth and seventh congressional district as Democrats\nAnd and that's not that's that's not a comfortable margin or for Democrats I don't think fifty points for as it carries down the ticket if you isolate what I did was I asked her our number crunchers just to isolate out a white female ... in this\nAnd the results were studying a number one uh you know just what ten days after the Kavanaugh uh the the Kavanaugh hearing couldn't concluded of Trump's support among white were white women in Georgia is ten sixty four percent have I'd say and that looks if you're if you're Brian Kemp\nYour aim is to be just the ... is is is to be three or four points more likeable than Donald Trump at this point you know that that's that's that's a fairly comfortable bar\nIf you um you know they said it what's interesting particularly about\nThat's that's that's a fairly comfortable bar if you um\nYou know at least it what's interesting particularly about these numbers that Jim is a pointed out is I assume\nThat some of these women are those suburban women voters that both campaigns really are targeting thinking that they're the independents who could flip either way so uh uh these are voters in many cases it but a burns really needs to win over\nAnd I think that's now why she's going to focus on the female vote in the rural areas I think that's why they're so instrumental in this campaign because women make or break campaign rain we've known that for years now\nI think her push you know she kind of shied away from that but I think are pushed really in these next few weeks I really getting onto the rural areas and really tackling those women who lived in the rural area\nMight disagree slightly I think you're going to see her ... paying a little bit more attention to to suburban Atlanta six and seven and district\nMay be up there ah Lucy McBride and Carolyn Bordeaux territory where there are a whole lot of people who are very well might\nBe truly independent women right right and and and again this is and this is where I Want to keep going back to the health care issue Medicaid expansion\nIs because if it if you it it seems to me that if you're going to make a\n... a a rational argument for for white women to vote for Stacey Abrams and and we know as we know indices in that politics isn't always the rational thing but if it if it is if you're making that rational argument healthcare seems to be the place to start yeah\nBy the way I said I was in ... bath I Know that her name I just had a moment to where I didn't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "12"}
