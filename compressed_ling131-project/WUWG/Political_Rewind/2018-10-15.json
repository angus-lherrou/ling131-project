I got to take issue with you you know you called this a manufactured of issue and and you're right it is but it was something that that that that the Republican lawmakers made up in February of twenty Seventeen\nBecause it was a reaction to a federal uh a settlement that compared to entered into and nine days later they pass legislation to to undo that settlement\nThey manufactured crisis as she's she's trying to imply\nThat there's like a ball out there which is not there trying to keep people from voting who are otherwise eligible to vote\nAnd this law does provide the right provision for it set up because partially because of ... own group\nWho's canvassers submitted thousands upon thousands of fraudulent and poorly filled out voter registration forms over the last three or four years some of that still under investigation for the reason why we have exact match\nIs to make sure that people aren't trying to ... ... registered to vote and vote in the wrong precinct or the wrong county or a or here are either on documentary illegal and make sure that that's being done correctly we all should be for a transparent open and get everybody to the polls and vote\nBut his manufactures and again is using identity politics where she's trying to do here is put fear into people of color that there's some group out there there's going to try to prevent them from the polls and they become justify a you know rectify that situation when when it's been a decade in the state of Georgia and they were much more farther along and that and nobody's\nTrying to do I mean it was actually my girlfriend and I think a lot about the tribal pollen yeah that's what he's trying to do empire play and I think some that play on both sides\nFor him in the tribal pollen yeah and that's what he's trying to do empire play and I think that play on both sides are running around around the country and you're going to see this or this kind of politics at play but I think it'd be used to be careful not to say that she's\nYou know or her organization beating Roger and I think if there's an investigation that's fine if there was some stuff that was done it was sloppy has got to be corrected obviously but here's the thing about suppression which I think you know probably everyone at this table we would not necessarily identify with\nBaby receiving notice in the mail that says Eli you don't have you may not be able to vote\nOr unless you do X Y and Z the fact that you get a notice that says that that is in in and of itself or the first step of suppression quite frankly because you're going to be thinking if you're not a regular voter or if you someone who has historically seen your right to vote or your mother's right to vote on your grandmother's right to vote or taking away\nSomebody's going to switch in your brain and you gotta think well maybe I just maybe I just don't need to fool with it and I think that's at play when you get a notice like that when I noticed it now to go you have to go to the pole to the precinct and handle all that when you're getting ready to vote what's your licence and all that so I get a notice saying you ... you can boating you may not be able to vote you'll find that once you get there\nI think it's fascinating ... that both of these issues the allegations voter suppression which are you a ... campaign Stacey on our show on friday talked about it I'm\nA cat and the other side of this uh this thing we're talking about with um a a a Brian can say that say she was trying to get a document is to the polls\nThese are playing out of this huge national stories the conservative media is really pick it up on the Stacey Abrams wants undocumented to vote on the liberal media I mean ... all over\nA national media you're seeing these stories pop up about Georgia has a state that is actively trying to suppress votes I\nPlaying out a national plan right now and it's just simply not trail and if you have registered and your ID doesn't match the name what's on the form you can sell no on the day in the ... so this is kind of thing [noise]\nYou know what I I Am what I'm seeing is on on both sides and and and he's a I Would invite you to jump in here too\nIt's kind of thing [noise] you know what I I Am what I'm seeing is on on both sides and in and he would invite you to jump in here too\nI I see both candidates kind of adapting to the decline of a statewide media in Georgia right in the early right in that you know I mean the AJC is is doing his very best but it doesn't have as many bodies as as it used to to throw at a at a at a gubernatorial campaign\nOr the same is certainly\nTrue for for every other news paper and and and most most TV stations and you've got you've got Stacey Abrams who on Sunday when to meet the press it went to CNN\nOr of course when we've already mentioned Brian chemical into Fox and friends all to reach their people via cable news hat and\nFox and friends on Sundays certainly didn't have Stacey Abrams on but they did do a story about a Stacey Abrams encouraging undocumented they played a little piece of this sounds that we shared with you that Steven follower got at the rally\nOr they played an edited version of it and they hit upon he's this theme that she's trying to encourage undocumented to vote\nI think is exactly right I think this is he'll those three things a gym and and I think number one and does this is a nationalized election around the country and folks\nThat because the house of representatives because they're stored nature of Stacey Abrams because the balance of power in because of the Trump effect both pro and con on voters think that that's why we get national coverage do you think the lack of of full body journalists at the local newspapers starting with AJC all the way down\nCovering state wide politics is a big deal and I think look in my my call about this is\nWe we talk a lot on this show and others about when Republicans or or or potentially using rhetoric that kind of divides the country as well and point out I agree it's both sides I Wish candidates both Republican and Democrats we stopped doing is we don't need young African Americans are young Hispanics of\nIndividuals thinking that is still Nineteen sixties Georgia because it's not\nIt's a completely different so any time very sensitive to anything that comes across trying to divide in that regard just like I think we've got to be careful when we talk about uh not letting undocumented a you know folks\nVote we need to make sure they know their welcome in our in our state and then they have a role in our society economy but there is a line you've got to become legal in order to vote and it was kind of things but ... got to be really careful here because seizure and I want to live in a world thirty forty years from now in Georgia\nI mean but there is a line you've got to become legal in order to vote and it was kind of things but ... got to be really careful here\nBecause Caesar and I want to live in a world thirty forty years from now in Georgia where we're not still debating this rye were the first part of opposed desegregation generation right that I think and make things better but we're still talking like we're living in the sixties when we're living in two thousand and Eighteen and things aren't perfect we got a long way to go\nBut our politicians got to be more responsible about this bone both sides in my opinion\nYou know one thing I you know and and I agree with you and everything he said but if our Brian Kemp actually would probably be encouraging people to vote in really talking about uh the work that his office has done over the years in terms of providing greater access to the\nPoint where they do have we've talked about the show they have done a good job in finding ways mobile registration that sort of thing the D. S. registration so it's interesting what you're saying to answer\nI Would be I Would ... maybe his advisors are telling him if he starts really encouraging every Georgia and to go out and vote that it it may sound a little bit and progressive but I think that that's something he should really be held or ... or ... heritage and I think ... I I don't talk to him down here\nAnd saying don't go and vote right I hear that from his campaign ... what would it really is interesting here is that he he is allowing sucks too loud and he is doing his job\nAnd you all have manufactured initiated that isn't true and so he's having to combat that\nYeah I think the way I think the way he can would accept the hurt a commercial or if it wasn't done directly by him where he talks about voting but I think he's really lean\nIn on encouraging people to vote and kind of get off the defensive on the last one I think they're\nOkay I hear all this and I wonder if in some ways Republicans are not reaping what face so\nRepublicans over the past decade here and across the country\nHave looked at ways to make it harder and harder to go to the polls and vote no they claim that because they want to stop voter fraud\nBut photo ID for instance hugely controversial when it first came on the scene a number of years ago why do I have to have a driver's license to show up and vote doesn't that disadvantage people who don't have driver's licenses do they tend to be a minority or potential voter ... in some ways Republicans may think\nThe disadvantage people who don't have driver's licenses do they tend to be a minority a potential voter ... in some ways Republicans may think they're doing this for ballot security but it does lead to a place for Democrats can challenge them on\nMusic of we've got we've got two two lawyers here at the table here and okay was Edmund Burke who said better the of the ten men go free than one one of one man be can convicted unjustly\nWell we've got a foot of the ... the here we've got we we've got we've got Republicans accepting of a a certain amount of collateral damage in order to make sure that no improper ... boat is cast\nAnd and I think that that's a that's a that's an interesting turn of philosophy that that that that you can you can question fifty three thousand\nRegistered or people who want to register to vote in order to keep in elections secure in you know I think I think there's got to be some adjustment to that\nThem and I would think Jordan if you've got especially if you've got down ballot candidates were who are not getting a tremendous amount of certainly not getting a lot of free media attention the challenge of how you position them to be a recognized too early voters must really be something\nI bet early voters who are coming out this early on in the game have already kind of decided way before you know who they're going to vote for so\nWe we do like he was saying we do tend to advertise maybe a month or two out to account for it but I don't think it's a big strategic decisions when I'm creating these campaign\nManager if I could add a non partisan message because if you want those robo calls to stop vote early [laughter] you know I never get any robocalls I feel kind of Long Island in line\nThe oh that's right I don't use all and I don't yeah All right near an election time out of our land line which we really don't use it as\nMuch as just ringing off the hook but one left\nRight I don't use all anyway and I was I don't think I don't yeah All right near an election time out of our land line which we really don't use it as much as just ringing off the hook but one last thing I'll say about early voting thing is and I haven't thought a lot about this uh but\nYou know as the numbers start to be revealed and kind of who's voting and how they're voting during this period that ended up itself that data Internet itself becomes a campaign issue right a landmine or a wave to ride and I think that's something that they began as you're getting\nYour getting real time feedback that can help inform how you plan out the final couple of weeks of your campaign that's really interesting All right\nUh you know what we have such a great staff\nOr you asked questions about the demographics in the counties that have extended voter registration Tom ... has got it for us\nWe already said Randall county of course is is predominantly African American which is one of the reasons when they were looking at closing some polling places a there was some alarm that was an attempt to suppress the African American vote so\nTurn out to eat or the ethnic composition is it's fifty five percent white thirty eight percent black four percent are Hispanic Grady county is fifty nine percent white\n... I'm twenty eight percent black ten or eleven percent basically Hispanic clay county is a sixty two percent African American or thirty percent or twenty nine percent white in like five percent Hispanic so it's a mixed bag\nThere do you have him ... minutes it's it's so\nI'd like to my my next next number but I'm I'm probably gonna crunch when I leave here is I'm trying to find them figure out how many registered voters are there and what percentage of the the state wide electorate those counties where they were really but you know what I'm just because voting but a registration was extended in those counties\nAlone doesn't mean that we're not dealing with other\n... other areas of the state's southwest Georgia oh no no you are also affected enormously such a wide swath right from Bainbridge to make and rely right a lot of folks still without power right absolutely far as I'm\nPresident Trump by the way we say the very beginning of the show he heads down here we are supposed to land I think around six o'clock this evening at Warner robins air force base case\nI think David Perdue is scheduled to be with him at ... ... is coming to you or your\nBase case I think David Perdue is scheduled to be with him at ... ... is coming to your ... your closest to a good friend and a ... a political leader you worked with closely Johnny Isaacson not going to be there today\nThat John he's not going to be the day because of the conflicts but he is going to be traveling tomorrow to south Georgia to tour of the damage with the governor and a potentially when the vice president of the United\nStates so you kind of well let's break that news have the vice president's coming to the president's here today and you tell us the vice president isn't I'm hearing\nFrom our sources the vice president probably going to be here tomorrow so I don't know if I'm breaking news or not a um it's out there and I do think that there'll be no be looking at other locations where the president didn't get to today um\nAnd you know looking at it and I'm from South Georgia I grew up in Albany so ah you know my heart and prayers are going to all my family and friends down that way\nA significant damage the national media for whatever reason it has been covering this storm the way they've covered the previous storms but with the kind of magnitude and the power this format and the damage that it did a lot of us in rural communities and I know people were feeling forgotten and I'm Glad to see the president going and hopefully the vice president governor deal\nAnd Governor Scott are doing a tremendous job would their Jima and with the Florida emergency management but they these ... bring attention to it are important to get the resources there to help fix it\nOr the governor will I did we already said the government will be down there to help most days I um [noise]\nAs long as we're talking gubernatorial uh and and the fact that the president vice president are going to look at hurricane damage I'm Jim Brian Kemp was down that way on Saturday he flew in and looked at damage in a number of\nCommunities that have been hard hit by a storm um\nAnd you know it it's it's silly and naive to say gee is there a political motivation behind a storm like that because it's silly because of course there is you cannot separate politics from the reality of what\nLook the actual disasters and the rise and fall of ... has been happening for for thousands and thousands of years and this is why everybody was worried about the impact of Puerto Rico on on on the Trump Administration right and this was if I mean Katrina and Bush it back in in what two thousand four\nAnd that was that was that was a tremendous turning point is it is not ... to ... point is you know it's\nBush back in in what two thousand four and that was so that was a that was a tremendous turning point is it is not ... to ... point is you know it's it's knowing that somebody out there is looking after you and looking out for you\nAnd if you if you if people don't have that that the point of view of it but then then then they're not there you are not one of them and we should also mention the Stacey Abrams has a bus tour down in that direction just right\nShe starts in ... started and make it and I believe today and is heading down that same a direction um\nOkay so speaking of a weekend visit a visit by a activities by the gubernatorial candidates Jordan Stacey Abrams a this weekend became the first major a gubernatorial candidate I mean first drug has it in a major party\nTo ride in the uh a gay pride parade\nThrough midtown Atlanta ah what's your take on her having that breakthrough\n[noise] I I think it's it's neat and she's definitely appealing to to her base in this situation and then she took the opportunity and and I I don't think that there was any issue with\nThat Cesar I Wonder I mean clearly that's the sort of thing that will eat and deer her to the gay and lesbian community\nWhich is a pretty powerful voting bloc an even better financial block you really you know it was a guy who ran for mayor of Atlanta how powerful it can be to make appeals to the algae B. T. Q. community right both for their votes and fundraising\nIsn't well two things about that number one\nI was really surprised that may news ah and I guess part of me I'm I'm In the bubble I think\nI mean my time in office I mean you it was you went to the gay pride\nParade you did that you've participated and your is your land and as I edited and the land as a candidate at the finish in the city of Atlanta major corporations are very involved I mean it's a huge employee ... ... it's amazing and the energy to our surprise it that was new that I Would not have thought about that in the mold the number two what I also\nNoticed and ... and then you know I'm not sure how this plays out how it gets played out but\nYou you see that this Jessica's issue in between Stacey being the pride parade and camp as it was reported you know check it out south Georgia in terms of what happened with the with the hurricane that's how that's being played a little bit and that's really interesting to see see that and\nYou know it's it's it's really interesting here OK\nGeorgia in terms of what happened with the with the hurricane that's how that's being played a little bit and that's really interesting to see see that and you know it's it's it's really interesting here okay we have Jordan who's a Republican correct\nCorrect okay and she is basically what she thinks it was neat that you walked in the gay pride parade\nOkay I'm having lunch I Will tell you where I Am I'm approached I'm approached by an older white Democrat we start ... who's the former state lawmaker we start talking politics\nAnd he just and he brings up the ... himself he says I just think it was a mistake I think was a mistake for her to go to that pride there's no question he was at the Piedmont driving\nCosts a lot of stir fry I Will say\nIt was county okay well here's a country club democratic\nOld so it's interesting Caesar it first of all what are these you said that I think is really interesting is\nYou can bury Abrams is here whether it's a gay pride parade or not she's here in metro Atlanta looking for votes or do we get gifts in South you're you're looking for votes now obviously they're both going to be all over the state but in some ways that tells us something about where they see their voting power centers right among other things\nI think that's absolutely right I think they were both plan on being the locations you know work with or without the parade itself I think the Jordan's great example where I think the state of Georgia is headed on as you I don't think it's as big of a deal as it went might've been twenty or Thirty years ago and the state and I think that the libertarian wing of the Republican Party which is growing\nLarger and larger everyday is a is not going to affect the votes on kind of either way I think it motivates her base but I don't think it's a huge negative or a you know among the Republican voter independent voters are that are out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "15"}
