P. B. radio family I personally am going to drink eight toast with my political rewind red ceramic solar up to all of you out there who play\nInto the rest of you will as well but I feel like there's an equal and it's vodka finish up on the gubernatorial poll that we got from landmark communications which we are very grateful\nThat Jordan few shared with us today Michael thirty one plus percent African American turnout is what gets us Stacey Abrams within the margin of error rate according baseball to Bryan cap how realistic is it that you're going to get\nAfrican Americans mobilized in those numbers\nAre hard heath earlier say yeah that would be historic numbers I mean that's we're talking Obama two thousand eight numbers\nYou're going to get African Americans mobilized in those numbers\nOn our heath earlier say yeah that would be historic numbers I mean that's we're talking Obama two thousand eight numbers [noise]\nUh and and that by no means is is is a heavy lift I mean we we know that but um we also know the work that uh that's been done throughout the state and the work that Stacey Abrams himself\nOr herself has done um so you know we as far outside the mature either I mean we we look in areas like the cab county I'm In Fulton County where we know we just have to have some really high numbers but Stacey Abrams I think at this point has been too\nYou know a hundred and fifty five hundred fifty six hundred fifty not county so I mean it is truly leave no stone unturned\nAnd and I do think now it's a possibility where people truly believe this is possible right and I think that to go back to talk about the Obama number two that was neat um you know there there's something there's something that can happen when we when we take the ability to that that you can believe that this can actually happened that we believe that we can have Stacey Abrams\nAny of that that the fight that I have a lot of time just you know from from my standpoint it's not just that safe havens is a female or black the most important as well um but a lot of people are gonna find within their dinner find with the message and I think when you couple\nYou know this blue wave that we continue to talk about with the with the reality that Stacey Abrams has spent a long time cultivating these relationships in the black and brown communities that that we could definitely see these numbers\nI Want to share with you and observation from one of our Facebook Live viewers of Laura Adams says less than twenty percent of the people in the poll were under we've tweeted to pull out already were under age forty five grossly underestimating the voting population and then she says were on fire for a change um [noise]\nIf I get that sentiment and we have seen that in your polling younger voters seem to be moving to Abrams um what what is the reality of whether people under age where you know how we can anticipate\nThe reality is that this is not a presidential election and that's when young people really do turn out they traditionally don't turn out for these types of race as hell that's why you're saying does killer numbers\nOkay if you get to wrap this part of the conversation\nI think there are two things we talked to Republican candidates in Georgia and around around the state there's ... first of all with African American vote there you have the opportunity vote for a historic figure and Stacey Abrams who's the would be the first African American female governor anywhere and they also have the motivation to vote against\nDonald Trump and some of the antics that Republicans release labeled with a around the country at times and I think those as a double motivator than we ever\nVote against Donald Trump in some of the antics that Republicans released labeled with a around the country at times and I think those are double motivator that we as Republicans have to pay attention to as one of the gas that other Republicans are going to have to close\nThe next two to three election cycles to remain relevant\nOr not only here and I also think of the younger voters is going to be interesting every cycle we're younger voters they're motivated yet at the data doesn't show that Republicans will be wrong to say is not going to happen this time and so I think that we've got to be prepared to be doing things to uh to uh go after those\nBuddy and I want to give you a chance to jump in but I Want to make one comment better always feel we have to do\nPeople they say oh but this poster that poster they didn't get the race correctly when the electric was finished this is a snapshot of the moment this is not as in Paul is intended to show the outcome shows where we stand today which\n... which you're looking for is you're looking for the movement yes then you and you pay attention to multiple polls and especially polls conducted by the same outlet so you can see time and time after time after time one thing I Would point out here is is that according to the the lend more communications pull ... Abrams is pulling twenty five point two percent of the white vote\nThat is actually pretty good which is pretty much what she'd need it and you know I'd have to I'd ... I I'm guessing here but I think Jason Carter was twenty three percent\nI I Believe you're correct that it it truly is not enough it's it's it's not enough but as they have on his was banking on the fact that she could pull some a Republican went into her can't and we're simply not seeing those numbers here\nUm if you pull over to the the ... side campus winning consolidating they GOP numbers by Ninety One point six\nOh no I I I don't disagree that some of the ... my point is that you've got an African American candidate who was doing just as well among white voters as a white candidate did four years ago well new known white candidates at four years ago\nAll right I'm going to have to get to a break in a minute but before we do Jordan why don't you throw out to us you did look at the approval numbers for a Brett Kavanaugh after a ... couple of days last week\nOf the entire country was focused on the confirmation hearing this showdown essentially what are your polling numbers showing about Georgians responding to Kavanaugh tell\n... in Georgia and potato peel era what we're saying is that I'm a majority of folks are saying that yes he should be confirmed said that the margin on that as forty nine forty three\nAnd what we're saying is that I'm a majority of folks are saying that yes he should be confirmed said that the margin on that as forty nine forty three and ... here in Georgia folks are saying yes go ahead and and ah confirm hand [noise]\nBut again you've got this age uh differentiate or you've got a Eighteen to thirty year old fifty percent say no the gap isn't as big as it was on Abrams and camp it's forty five say yes fifty three percent a thirty one forty five say no\nAh Fort if forty six to sixty four it's just about even but once again he's\nOver sixty five\nPeople by wide margins say yes a confirmed Brett Kavanaugh and\n... and there's this this was his age gap here on this issue I think it was also on the flip side of the bill if you look at the gap for females right around the country you would think the gender gap would be greater but a forty three percent of the females in the in the in the polar saying they're still supportive of forty\nSeven forty three so I learned area that we met in a ... that's where we got to go first it's it's much closer than we might have anticipated given how much we're hearing from women being upset about it and if\nAnd if you're looking for the the the sixth and seventh congressional district to turn on the votes of of of white suburban women that's eating you need to you you need a stronger number than the\nMichael I think that's a really really smart observation this does not appear to be the kind of numbers that can change the outcome of a incumbent a winning victory in the sixth and seventh there may be other factors for this is going to play a ... a smaller role than some people may expect if their numbers you know prove true that\nThere are a lot of factors and come to that um and this is one I think that's more of a generic type thing we talk about white suburban mom just as a whole and I think that's where you know we're going to look to see how this phrase is going to bring we're willing to serve us\nI'm Sorry to interrupt we'll talk a little bit more about that and move on to a couple of other headlines that are important to us on today's show but let's go back to Bradley George Andrew Dawson who want to remind you that we really do need your help to keep programming like political rewind going we\nAlways need your help we cannot do it we do hear a gp be without your help without your contributions that what the that's what this falls on Dr is all about especially as we enter the final days so let's hear from we ... we haven't already at eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight you can also gifts\nEspecially as we enter the final days so let's hear from ... from you know we have an already an eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight you can also give ... dot org\nAnd we're in the final Ninety minutes give or take a chance to do their own to these big drawing for the Callaway resorting gardens ultimate get away\nWith is is really nice like tonight stay admission to the gardens tickets to fantasy out in lights were up to six people benefit lots of course the spectacular southern holiday tradition and one of National Geographic's top ten holiday like displays in the world\nYou can get into the drawing that happens at four o'clock this afternoon by going to G.
