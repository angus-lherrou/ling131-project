football you know soccer the sport of kings and then move on to the NFL I'm joined by SB Nation Tyler times whose work is featured in the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing\nIn bookstores this week welcome back and congratulations Tyler thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalists you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honor and all do the soccer superstar from Portugal who plays prevent us in Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he is now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten when all those settled with her out of court and pay a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she filed a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her\nOr NATO has denied these allegations but in the reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger athlete on this planet do you see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given the the week that we've had and also not just the week with a year you're looking at Ohio State and Jessica of course the work you've done and Baylor and Kavanaugh made me wonder how you're going to keep\nYour enthusiasm level hide it we used to be paid closer attention I'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction that it made them it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it\nI Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nI Would if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful as always uplifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of that it's possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected as she her pain yeah and you've got Nike\nYou have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that's one billion for one player and of course a e sports has also said that they are monitoring the situation very closely because this is the area that you traffic and\nWhen you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like\nA giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football on sexual violence and particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so when the last few weeks ... one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate era greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read is an all pro level almost all world levels safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sets has been also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper has said that he sides with the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the parents have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've been nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us\nThat yeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just got my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nAnd met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\nDoes a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player\n[noise] I'm going back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richard sense out there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and racism that's right that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complex\nMe too right so we can see a direct impact here and it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read his back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job I got one\nAnd also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen the entire NFC outhouse needed so they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for exactly every was not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster took multiple mental fall and the gridiron for agreed to even get proposed that he should have a job\nOr the general manager Marty ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous like we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that it has presser which would operate by the way I Do think yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nThe Eric and I talked about this at Lincoln during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go ahead first on\nShaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target and they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose so what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and they entertain the fan base they have no other rights are concerned they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas and safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his own sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] got your Jersey money no friends\nYou know there's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all of this question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns a company that in quotes like who owns\n... and what did they tell us Jessica sometimes refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah he was talking about\nAnd putting quotes like who owns the ... and when do they do a stress I go sometimes refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah you're talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes with hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says dearest with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices either he says the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg or he says the money is more important to my kids which he did say I'm just going to keep pushing\nAnd so I think it's powerful that people like Earl Thomas in JR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's no levy on bill on the field as we've seen with the Steelers off in\nThe audience doesn't go the team is bad losses a crew people get fired and that's just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst\nIs it going this American

Thirteen endings weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we went home game though you know I mean you know when it's going to run exactly right you know they don't wear team all year though yeah you know they went through these spells of what looked like the Toomey unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five game so I guess they should get a medal for that\nOutside of the red Sox winning a hundred and eight games that Bolton that sat on the top just most of the explainable second tier\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and fifty engaged for winning and winning Ninety five with that sort of semi coffins is doing something there is news this week in a novel move tennis channel will begin showing wait for it tennis\nMore specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture would be in sports for the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games and bear market because some cable networks won't carry sports LA\nWith a combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports fan do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true I also think there is another phenomenon going on that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan without attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter]\nI mean we always to be a financial betting but now you can be a fan through fantasy sports you can be a financial memorabilia all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media and nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff is a phenomenally to stash its decision that the NHL mates\nWell you could be a fan through media nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff is a phenomenally just after ... that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not a sports journalist right when they went to ... spike TV for the playoffs remember that went before that it went to a sports channel\nYou know they went ESPN's only professional league yet that time and he is the end it among you know they might be SPN they did what he SBN dot which is to hide things from the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me also\nKnow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of W T H tenants than I Am because I watched women as much as I watched the man I'm happy that their back and actually watch them for the season\nAnd you know finally Charlie you know show would be complete without at least some discussion of the Cleveland Browns but here's a story about a different team a barn Iowa has a locked cooler full of Budweiser not Bud Light but Budweiser that it will open\nWhen the corn ... when its first football game of the season great idea right\n[noise] yeah I don't know I I don't know if someone barn idol is doing this but okay they're just making fun of the Oscars that cooler is likely going to stay close for at least a week\nBut here's my question what happened to Nebraska football if you are of a certain generation\nMy late mother in law was from certain Nebraska her brother and her father and her grandfather all played football for Nebraska\nI mean I think they've been crippled I think my conference realignment and by the fact that the whole nature of college football's changed the thing about of debris asking teams was outside of people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons say would beat you to death yet over the all up and down the field\nAgainst changed it to a very big people who are really fast and I don't think the brass has never really caught up on that\nNow we've come a long way since Tom Rath Roger Craig huh\nThere you go you can find a sports writing and Charlie Pierce some Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week on only game thank you Charlie banks are\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou know the same game recognize game\nWhether it's Aaron Rodgers and Tom bringing the brawn James and Kevin Turan ... when it sees it\nSame goes for the only game part\nPretty good to to recognize our game by subscribing an apple Comcast danger or wherever\nAnd while you're there and leave us a review you're helping listeners find our show and helping us raise our game\n[noise]\n\nJimmy Connors maybe America's greatest tennis player\nAsh maybe it's most influential they couldn't stand each other ... really dislike anyone who had a kind of brag a dose show\nAnyone who ... themselves and the way that Congress did that's University of South Florida professor and historian Raymond ... it just wasn't one to attack anyway always gave everybody the benefit of the doubt\nBut as a member of his family told me once the only person that he really didn't like on the tour was Jimmy Connors one was brilliant but craving the other a quiet revolutionary with a powerful sense of patriotism here is only a games Gary well like on Arthur ashes clash with his greatest nemesis when that unfolded on and off the court\nThe coral between Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe probably began with the Davis Cup the annual international team tennis event that dates back to Nineteen hundred ... were courting\nRaymond arsenal their attitudes towards playing on the U.S team were diametrically opposed\nI think actually emitted tremendous amount to him because it affirmed his notion of self worth that he was a citizen a proud citizen and that he was respected enough to represent his nation\nAsh was the first African American to represent us in Davis Cup competition he had played on the U.S team in eight different years by the time Jimmy Connors was dominating men's tennis and in the mid seventies but Connors refused to join the team irritated ashes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Only a Game", "city": "Carrollton",
