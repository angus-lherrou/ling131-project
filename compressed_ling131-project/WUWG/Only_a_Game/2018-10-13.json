know one of our guests this week is very excited about that Sports Illustrated Charlotte while they're welcome back thank you Karen I'm thrilled to be here\nJason gay Wall Street journal I guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball postseason but I'm On ... about everything current you know that's\nLet's take it away I'm super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim certainly I got\nI got to buy books I like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning 'cause I was so nervous and I was freaked out and they wanted and I was like this is wildly and no one like that\nDid you on cork champagne or whatever\nIt was like cracker jacks wind up in the air and the ... um\nNo but I think you know I was super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every fan would be jazz for the rivalry\nAnd yet when I went to Fenway in Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was playing for but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kind of a likeable didn't have enough jerks the red Sox do they need more jerk for that rivalry to be really if\nThey know Jason that exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot and not to like\nAbout it and I still do not\nGo into the locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR are trying to talk to him and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it\nAll right Jason what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are going around dogs they were just\nSo annoyed they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games of eight in the morning ... he's a boy and\nPrime time after a sort of fed up with all those east coast media bias\nSo speaking of east coast media bias we should acknowledge the media bias of this panel which is we are three Red Sox fans right\nI mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nTo do here and I said it like I had a lab you're you're wearing a Red Sox Jersey so it's just join and get out and I wanted to have roosters\nI'm not even going to pretend care and I'm I'm a home or\nRed Sox Jersey so it's just join and get out of roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend care and I'm I'm a Homer but\nJason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like there too and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nNever satisfy Karen\nMy head and the game you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox okay if I just it's a lot of waited long enough\nOf the children are All right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jenny butler he had an exciting return to Minnesota ... practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me and my farmers numerous ... that's what you're going to do is on the line\nAnd this is a is it not the right way for it to come in and things I think it was the wrong thing to do what we don't know what to do I think that I was on okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do what I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes\nBut as frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do [laughter] so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when\nThe NBA ventures into W W story so I'm gonna let you go to Mars you normally do out there and it was a little concerned about very worried about my reputation\nLook I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler knew exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the job with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I think that if I were his teammates I'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on ... campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of choreography or team he bought alerts part\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't\nCare and also I have seen you walk into the studio saying you bleep and uh [laughter]\nI don't know if you are one of the cast stones you know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads Anon squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte and made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like the news really\nAnd like okay we'll give me no clue\nJust just just use me care whether our gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in our country and you surely know that Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once again so key unless it's really nice\nWhat all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those variety good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games\nOnce more Nick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire for their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football games\nIs poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there [laughter] here is a thought for Alabama plays some exciting football games that begin at reasonable times\nNick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday So the ... that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama\nOn a Saturday So they realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette I mean no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand dollars [laughter] okay forty nine to nothing it was forty eight to nothing about how\nPart of this is a little weird of a take I realized pardon me kind of fees or he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd be like\nI like are you kidding I did for you I mean\nI also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of understand what you're you're a fancy\n[noise] so is that it for the website do you think you'll ever attempted\nIt again [noise] um [noise] I don't see updating it again um I don't know how much longer to go it might maybe just go until the registration runs out and about ten months or so shutting down the Web site would be really hard I Know it's probably the right thing to do maybe\nAs I you know the first year of grief it's really hard and I myself reaching [noise]\nAll over

most WNBA stars where men signature issues what gifts\nBut now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie hold your women you all want to talk about his shoe speaking of soon there'll be a Seventy sixer center July al and beat has signed a five year jail with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote\nThere's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I mean as someone who bought at a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using as a car for\nThe problem with what they looked fine on the big man right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey looked like art on campus but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envy who has charisma beyond belief a so I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said he I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nAnd we're not doing the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers are just had a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked few yes\nWhat struck me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double A.\nAre starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked fear\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm or the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough\nTo make me care about this bribery trial it's ... criminalizing it underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones that are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking at the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags spelling whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWill do something wrong with playing in Australia certainly has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship and Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high but again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized\nBy these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is dark Christiana Ronaldo of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document and which Fernando admitted to non consensual sex\nNow er and all this lawyer is saying that document was acquired in computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked\nThat sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden otherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge at All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr ... who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nHe's written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is you know you're out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I rarely get\nLike can we try and well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that\nSo I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nIs that they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and it's time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting\nIt's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson is please put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what was mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't [laughter]\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out on the field warmed up wearing his Jersey [laughter]\nYou know throwing throwing the potato to throw the guy out is or what did he does is a real thrill back to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants though [laughter] right [laughter] you can\nFind that's worth reading of Charlie Pierce Sports Illustrated and he joined us each week on only again thanks Charlie Gard [noise]", "show_name": "Only a Game", "year": "2018",
