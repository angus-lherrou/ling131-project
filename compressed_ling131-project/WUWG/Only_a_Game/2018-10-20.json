given and it's time for three stories you should know we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific study I'm not joking but I promise it'll be fun I'm joined by Michael leave the athletic and by ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you\nAnd I ... a new scientific study I'm not joking but I promise it'll be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both make severe thank you Karen [laughter]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to the risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and\nI'm all questions and no answers Sonora what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't mean to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain as younger that's when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefits seemed more related to playing a team sport than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nI don't know if I have an issue with high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner lag really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those ... years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you know from my years from ... high school football uh no just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise a self esteem of the athletes to perform because you're living guys saw it on the field as one if you played high school basketball the gym maybe Mt if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run it\nOf the gym maybe Mt if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself because there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across country but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and sad\nThat they don't really need to tell 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally in Britain far and yeah yeah yeah and you know Tom brainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need to high school football flag football like with with the with the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find did win flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do [noise] Michael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWherever latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pain players\nMe that the G League is now offer an alternative to the and sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have elite prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nWhich is a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WMBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness there but a signed with an agent\nAnd but there is a risk to this\nOne being you're playing and ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom a skill perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age also the G ... did not provide the platform that ... billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players by just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to sell their likeness and decide shoot is\nTheir athletes and especially the elite basketball players by just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to sell their likeness and his sons shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can ANC ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the ... sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing\nCool that said probably the best possible outcome\nFrom is right or at least as I see it wouldn't be\nThat the threat of\nElite high school players going to the G League instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own cars they just feel like at a ... only way it works and that seems like a an uphill battle is that if\nThe alternative is a good enough one can actually be a source of real pressure on me and said it will I which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think that kind of work that Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these have high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here it it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players in a league that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ... and\nAnd the fact that they would maybe Maureen\nAs a better TV ...\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find what they meant [laughter]\nI totally agree I I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love the interplay and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward male athletes much more significantly than we do females\nTotally ... I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent\nThe females totally ... I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent\n... percent to sort of ... percent [noise]\nSo there's only a game tradition we save our most important topic for the last ... who you\nAre I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just say is from a column for the spotlight investigative team I wrote a piece recently about\nTouchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system a how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nThat just ahead on only a game and remember to follow us on Facebook and Twitter at only\nAll this week on this American Life I'm pleased to resent here the Brooklyn Academy of music up or how they [noise]\nBut it's still true stories like we always do this time turn into a musical and turned to the opera also\nRemembered as little as ...\nPerfectly or even merit this week on the American life at noon today right here on eighty five\nSupport for TB programs comes from our listeners and Georgia southern university rapidly becoming an intellectual catalyst for southeast Georgia and the state Georgia southern graduate so sought after because of their leadership and hands on real world experience Georgia southern dot edu and we'll start hills\nFor southeast Georgia and the state Georgia southern graduate so sought after because of their leadership and hands on real world experience Georgia southern dot edu\nAnd we'll start health system a proud member of the Mayo Clinic care network will start doctors can consult with male and complex cases keeping patient care at home well star dot org slash male will start a Mayo Clinic working together working for you\nKnew what shouting ties we take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ...

the Nazis well look at athletes who stand or sit or Neal in protest but now it's time for this week's news with Charlie Pierce hey Charlie again\nIt's not normal for us to start in the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common don't we start to segment we both argument using true and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy's on blue spent the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right and he's on the lam and a half to track them down any gallons burger now to bring him back ... taxes\nGrand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes\nDestroying are hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing documentary about you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against USA Gymnastics or to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[laughter] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was and now I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first up does the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter]\nThe second issue to me is a bit more complicated in September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout the swoosh on her Gulf shoes and as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it yeah\nWell first of all I missed the ... in which Mary Bono is became qualified or on USA true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what USA Gymnastics do at this point at\nAll bring anybody back the Olympics will bring people back you'll see what will probably be a Nike field run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart caring and more people to listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthem thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation and Jerry Jones bombing mayor down in Houston a Gerges soon and and kill and those guys are print pretty much margin\nThe anthem thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation not Jerry Jones\nBombing near downtown Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches I once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realized that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the abdomen anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend one\nI really love about this story is that they actually came up with actual data\nThat showed that tweet made by the president didn't turn out fans off to football what turned fans off to football was those owners speaking out right\nAnd finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah ice lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news first of all I Want\nTo Jersey Jersey so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters\nAnd then Crosby and McCain and played for the gang [laughter] which at the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one\nThis isn't a funny one this is an author McKinnon even said hey you've got you can't really put out which is pretty good considering most of them did skate before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is that really you know [laughter]\nI've always been you can sell hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the lions practice very hard and are in the next Olympics they will be the biggest thing or\nYou can find the sports writing a Charlie
