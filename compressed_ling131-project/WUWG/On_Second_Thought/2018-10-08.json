I get children and I stay home and not be political active anymore so they actually get into a marriage for me I was Seventeen as it happens so fast\nBe political active anymore so they actually errands and marriage for me I was Seventeen as it happens so fast I I'm left Iran to India\nParents think it's good for me just leave Enron left Iran as age of Seventeen\nBut the authorities still came to your house looking for you\nYeah the revolution guard came to my\nParents' house [noise] and my parents say I'm not in Iran I left to India and they didn't believe that they couldn't find me and they I raised my sister\nShe was only Fifteen Years old that time did they think she was you know the thing if they keep her I come back\nA and she keeps up friendships with several of these French women for years afterwards and this is also where he first meet Abigail Adams\nHe met Abigail and Paris\nYes he'd already known John Adams for quite a long time but Abigail I've never met him so she obviously knew about him through her husband John and Thomas Jefferson had been friends\nAnd when she arrived in Paris and they meet they have a lot of common interests they go to plays together they both enjoy music and I think intellectually they were well matched\nThe letters are you know witty affectionate playful and ways that we might not expect\nDo think that her with grace understanding of politics were particularly important to him can you tell he loved corresponding with her\nYes and there's times where he needs to get information from John Adams when John is in London and there are times where he's not getting what he needs and Alaska Abigail can you give me this information and he actually says at one point after John has not been giving him the information he needs from London\nPlease send me along the news and he concludes quote to to monger I'd rather receive it from you\nAnd after John has not been giving him the information he needs from London please send me along the news and he concludes quote to to monger I'd rather receive it from you\nSo you know he's being a little for teachers maybe playful but he knows that partially this is acceptable because John Adams is in on the friendship\nJefferson would send one letter to John and one time we go on the same day and so he knew that John Adams was seeing these letters and that in fact makes it safer if he's being flirtation at somebody else's in on this there's nothing clandestine here\nWhat about Washington Franklin and some of the others did they also have really interesting and notable friendships with women through letters\n[noise] yeah I think we often think of George Washington as being the state and stern figure and even some people at the time described him that way but he also really enjoyed having female friends and had multiple female friends\nYou can see and his letters he is playful and letters with them and they are playful back to him\nAnd so we do see a different side of him and those friendships his friendship with and if you'd know stocked and for instance Stockton was in New Jersey woman or and during the American revolution Washington spent time with other officers at her home\nAnd she had been writing poetry about him in praise of him and sent him some poems and apologized for still sending him all these poems praising him and he writes back\nNo it's really okay but for punishment you'll have to have dinner with me or not or formal language than that but he is being playful and some people have seen that letter and said oh is he flirting are they having an affair no this is how friends interacted with one another in this\nPeriod was there an interesting letter that you think a ha I think I've decoded would initially seemed very complex but some of\nLetters that help with this are in fact letters where people say they're not sure what the rules are or say that they think that they're breaking a rule and there's a lot of letters were men right to women and they're saying I'm not quite sure I'm supposed to be writing to you because\nOr I'm not sure how I'm supposed to open this letter so here's an example\nThere's a gentleman named the Reverend Horace highly\nHe's writing to a woman he met in Baltimore who had married Napoleon's brother Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte\nSo this is Eighteen Eighteen\nHe's writing to a woman he met in Baltimore who had married Napoleon's brother Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte\nSo this is Eighteen Eighteen he opens letter without any deer or so and so you know usually we'd see deer ... or ... or Mrs Bonaparte something like this at the beginning of a letter and he just goes right in and says\nQuite at a loss to know how you would receive any one of these forums and therefore I have rejected them all and written on he's saying I don't know the proper way to do this he doesn't know the proper weight because in fact there are all these guides to letter writing in the period\nThat tell you how to write a letter to a business partner how to write a letter to a father when you've been a bad son like really specific letters but no model letters between friends the opposite sex\nThat makes sense given the letters were pretty much all you had there weren't phone conversations to female you would have to have these form guides to say you know here's a forum for this feeling of ... yeah and\nJust like in personal interactions there were a lot of rules about a cat and the idea is that a letter was supposed to be a substitute for conversation and people talked about that in their letters and sometimes you know one gentleman who wrote another female friend\nSaid I'm not sure I'm supposed to write you but if letters are supposed to be just like conversation and we can talk in person why can't I write you a letter and have us have a conversation part of what we can see in these letters to is that women are able to push back if they're not happy with how they're being treated in ways that\nShow these relationships are more egalitarian than any other relationship between a man and a woman at this time so there is one example here there was a woman that young woman named ... pain living in New England and she befriended a young minister who later became\nFamous in the Unitarian church and the transcendental is movement willing Mallory chanting and she was trying to get a job as a school teacher trying to make a living on her own and he criticizes her at one point saying that it sounds like what you're doing is too much about making money\nAnd she is furious and she writes this lengthy reply defending herself\nShe says I did not look very sober at the passage in your letter which covertly accused me of being guided cheaply by mercenary views a perfect conviction that I did not deserve it preserve the composure my features\nThat might sound really formal toss but she was saying I was so angry I could\nA perfect conviction that I did not deserve it preserve the composure my features\nThat might sound really formal toss but she was saying I was so angry I could barely keep myself together\nI could spit on you and she says it is not an easy thing my dear sir for a young in solitary female to a search and maintain her own right an sustained by friends whose duty an inclination equally lead them to shelter from injustice and censure\nAgain the sounds formal but what you're saying is I Need to make money for the rest of my family what do you want me to do\nYou also have these exchanges between not men and women but women writing two good friends are sisters and others about the nature of relationships with men [noise]\nYeah so there is a letter between a woman named Elizabeth pea body and her younger sister Mary these Peabody women are quite remarkable\nWomen they were living in New England they were schoolteachers some of the time Elizabeth the body befriended a man who later became a famous education reformer horse man\nMan had been recently widowed and Elizabeth had described how he quote latest had upon my ... so that he could shed tears of grief and at other times he sought comfort in her arms on the parlor couch\nSome areas out of town Elizabeth writes this particularly interesting conversation she has with him one evening that was quote full of feeling and affection\nAnd they talked about she says explicitly the difference between love and friendship\nAnd this was not abstract she wanted to know where their relationship was\nMy friendship is a great comfort to him I only wanted to be sure that he would never feel that I felt more than friendship for him\nIn order that he might have no sense of responsibilities and receiving many kind offices so basically what she's saying is I don't want him to misunderstand that I'm letting him crying my arms as romantic\nShe goes on to say that a horse was quite happy to hear about this he was relieved ah he saw it as a friendship and Elizabeth concluded from the discussion that quote\nHowever affectionate we may be it is a brothers and sisters love on both sides so pointing that's a nice family terms lets them continue their emotional intimacy without the intrusion of any kind of\nA desire attraction at least on the surface\nThat you were able to find these letters have you can\nOut the intrusion of any kind of a desire attraction at least on the surface it's\nThat you were able to find these letters have you concluded whether\nAmerican men and women of the founding era felt freer with each other because they were able to be in a society away from the strictures of European mores or whether they were more stilted\nThey are separate from Europe but in fact they want to prove that they are more virtuous than Europe Europeans in this period and this doesn't apply to all this is the really upper upper echelons of society in France and in England are having affairs all over the place [noise]\nPart of what's going on over there but particularly in America's people are saying this is why the French Revolution when bad is that women were corrupting men by sleeping with them that all these people having affairs that is what corrupted their political system and that's part of what is wrong with England's political system the\nWhole American experiment was based on this idea of Republican virtue\nThat you were going to put others before yourself that you were going to be morally upright and if people are going to elect leaders they need to be virtuous enough to know who the right people are and their leaders need to be virtuous enough to lead\nSo this question of virtue is very important and it is very much tied to sexual virtue part of\nThe issue with friendships in America it's actually harder than in Europe to be friends with the opposite sex because you have to prove that this is a virtuous pure relationship that this is not one of these corrupt European forms", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year":
