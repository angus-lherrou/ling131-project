a new report from voices for George's children Erika ... is executive director of that organization and joins us in the studio Erica welcome thank you good morning\nAlso joining the conversation Georgia Health News editor Andy Miller Andy great to have you with us leader well it is a grim finding and startling I think but Erika question jumps out why aren't low income kids from Georgia to get into health insurance for which there eligible\nIt's a great question right now we have over a hundred and sixty thousand children in Georgia um [noise] who don't have healthcare coverage the majority of which like you said over eighty percent of eligible remain uninsured\nThere are several reasons why that is occurring first I Would say the system is just simply not that easy to advocate\nI Am a health care provider a psychologist I consider myself pretty health literate and I will tell you it is challenging to go through that application process mounting an overwhelming busy application process only done in person or is it available online so it's available both in person and on line but there are several challenges to accessing that despite the two\nPoints of access one being that\nI'm the hours of operation again in person support or during working hours the majority of parents of children who are eligible for Medicaid impeach care are working and so they would need to take off work to go there\nLose wages are potentially get in trouble with their employer to be able to do that\nTransportation is also another issue that we heard from communities and being able to get to the offices to access that support in applying\nBut also for the online system Internet access is a huge challenge we heard from communities that although there might be Internet access within city limits for many of our rural communities there just simply isn't Internet access at home\nMoreover let's say you overcome all those hurdles and you have Internet access you get home from work at your kids settled you log on in the evening to apply and we were learning that the online application was actually shutting down at about five pm\nEvery day and so some parents would spend one two three plus hours entering all their information and they'd get to the end they click submit\nSubmit summit and nothing would happen or it would look like it was submitted but really the information\n[noise] didn't reach it uh didn't reach the place and so they would wait months thinking that their application went through and then learn actually nothing happened with that so let's walk through what it's like I mean that's uh\nIt uh didn't reach the place and so they would wait months thinking that their application went through and then learn actually nothing happened with that\nSo let's walk through what it's like I mean that's a terrible texture obviously but so somebody who was trying to get health insurance for their kids say I'm a mom in rural Georgia my son has asthma I Want to make sure he gets his inhaler so what kind of cool to do I have to jump through\nIncreasing rates a few suicide here tragically and and and incredibly tragically youth as young as nine years old and our state taking our lives and the more that we can make sure that the adults and equip parents with the information they need support\nKids is going to be critical and we're seeing that now already if the results of the investment\nAmerican sitcom she's executive director of voices for George's children thank you very much for speaking with us\nAnd count and also Andy Miller he

I think there were between Thirteen and twenty five to forty percent of people identified as not straight you know so this isn't\nSomething that's as rare as I think people assume it is I think that a lot of people are questioning their attractions when they're in their adolescence and these ... these things are kind of coming to the fore now it's interesting too because I think a number of\nWay novels are about being in the closet or about coming out but you chose to explore this middle ground and uncertainty about sexuality what is it about that ambiguity that I think feeds certainly a lot of drama but how do you play that out well honestly I think\nThat honestly that might be the most important part of the parts you know in adolescence were questioning so many things and trying to figure out\nOur place in the world and there is some excellent books about kids who are in the closet and trying to come out I'm Becky Albert tallies uh Simon versus a homo sapiens agenda comes to

do I think about politics what do I think about how do I feel about this that or the other in the world like this is another thing that just this kind of on the list I think of things that kids are
