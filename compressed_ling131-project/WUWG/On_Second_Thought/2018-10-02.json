Atlanta which I wrote in the very first day that the idea came to mind was to create a school that was free of homophobia and trends phobia where everybody had a full seat of the educational table and everybody could be who they were just to be peace\nYeah of homophobia and trends phobia where everybody had a full seat of the educational table and everybody could be who they were just to be period

who's been involved with our school is alive today\nWe have certainly beating the odds by far given that the\nThe suicide attempts rate and the suicide\nCompletion rates is easily three to four times the amount in your average than your average says gender kid um for trans uses ... four to five times higher and for all the trans use ... parents and trans educators who we've worked with\nIncluding myself as a trans man we are all alive and most of us are doing pretty darn well and so I Would say\nAll the work that everybody did to make this safe space exactly and the time when we needed it and all the work that we've all done all around the state and all around the world\nTo show how to use that they are firmed and that their loved and that they can actually find spaces where people get them and want them to be happy\nTo hear from one of your students Josh was born a girl named Sabrina that identifies as now here and just talking about what private school and then to him and didn't [noise] for\nMe the pride school is why I don't know like I said oh no I'm I feel that I Am out in and out and that everyone have health class thing\nSo what happens next for students like Josh\nWill you know it's interesting that you brought up um that that student who was interviewed on practically the first day of school and was one of our very for students to enroll\nI'm Josh actually stopped using that name and male pronouns and went back to using a her original named Sabrina and many students like Sabrina are out in public schools now are having a pretty good time and spending time in schools where they do get to be themselves\nAnd uh some of them are off getting their one student got her GED one student is in public school\nBeen spending time in schools where they do get to be themselves and uh some of them are off getting their one student got her GED one student is in public school or where her parents teach or read in high school or in some of them are back to home schooling and\nYou know a lot of it is they have been given a one of the things that we loved about what we gave to Sabrina is that we gave her a chance to re boot and have a place where she didn't have to worry every time she walked into school\nAnd she got grounded again and she got strong again and she was labeled also to give to other students who were facing the same bullying that she faced indicator and now she's\nSet up to be an activist for the rest of her life should choose to be along with all the other kids because every time they find one other person to talk to\nThey changed the world\nAnd actually our student number zero Emerson or who I worked with for almost a year in helped to found pride school he's off at Marlboro College in Vermont now and he's found his tribe and he actually has a trans man roommate and a gay man who says residents assistant and he's doing\nAmazing things out in the world and that's the coolest so clearly community was a big part of the goal here how is that community ... connected those who were at pride school actually yes I'm a shockingly to me\nSome of them are who were in school together or are they hang out every weekend still and some of them stayed together for a while and just like all teenagers especially the ones that live far away they connect here and there and they connect here and there and sometimes they go their separate ways just like what happens when anybody was far away\nUm but a lot of the parents have stayed connected with each other and a lot of the families that didn't even the families who didn't even get to pride school are probably more connected with each other including with my family than ah than they than some of the families who stayed you know we're in the school because we touched\nDozens and dozens and dozens of families who are looking for support who are looking for families like their families for the kids to play with families for their teens to hang out with and families to just go and have coffee and not be isolated anymore because they could actually talk about their kids and not worry about it getting to the whole neighborhood\nSuch at ... pride school land to have found a
