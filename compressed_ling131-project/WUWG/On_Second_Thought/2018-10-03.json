Supreme Court given his record predictions are that have an outlet to shift the court to a conservative majority\nThat got us wondering about what cases there on the docket secretaries that began on Monday ... trying to put more I'm Matt he's associate professor of law at Emory University ... hello how are you very well seven thousand cases Supreme Court each year how many will it here this year\nSo typically will hear a brown eighty cases uh so it could be um you know somewhere between Seventy five and eighty five cases but it'll be around eighty cases that just been true with some consistency over the past few years\nThe cases that the Supreme Court martial law here I understand that the majority are decided unanimously or pre teen years unanimously accept some of the hot button social issues that are likely to break the court down along party lines any of these coming up and twenty Nineteen term\nI think one of the cases are types of cases that you're going to hear about it because there's a series of them across the country\nIs titled seven employment discrimination\nAnd whether a particular statue when it says that you can't discriminate on the basis of sex whether that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation\nAnd whether it includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression and what's coming up protests there was someone who worked for the Georgia State capital\nAnd when she began working there she identified as a man presented as a man biologically I'm a man and a during the course of her time on the job she transitioned to a\nTo being a woman and that that's when she was fired\nAnd she sues the sex discrimination when I was a man a it was perfectly okay for me to work here but now I'm a woman you fired me but for the fact that I'm presenting as a woman I Would have my job that's the only reason I Do have a job\nAnd in that case actually the eleventh or get an opinion joined by or perhaps even written by a very conservative judge William hire a who was one of the people that\nPresident Trump was considering for the Supreme Court he actually ruled in favor of the plaintiffs eleventh circuit did in that particular case um and they just simply look that says you can't\nFor the Supreme Court he actually ruled\nIn favor of the plaintiffs the eleventh circuit did in that particular case um and they just simply look\nThat says you can't discriminate on the basis of sex that seems like a very clean case when this person present it as a man they could keep their job when they present it as a woman they couldn't ah and so that's the case out of Georgia that people might be interested in\nAnd she ... thinks the many businesses and individuals who work to make our fundraising campaigns that success including the parks catering for providing food and beverage is for volunteers and staff drained are correct on drive\nFrom Georgia Public broadcasting this is on second thought I'm Virginia Prescott as the FBI investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continue we're getting some insight on cases on the Supreme Court docket for twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen term on\nThe line with us from Chicago associate professor of law at Emory Fred Smith\nFriend both pro and anti abortion rights advocates expect to petition for cases that erode protections for Rosie wait there are cases pending and lower courts now that restrict funding or methods or access to abortion how likely is it that the court which hear any of those cases that term\nClear whether it will happen this term but it does seem very likely that the next few years what will happen as the composition of the court to shift and especially with Justice Kennedy the long run the court\nIs going to be a lot of interest in testing the limits of roe versus Wade a few years ago there was a five to four opinion women's health I'm\nOut of the state of Texas where there were a lot of restrictions that were placed on a witch doctors could perform abortions I wear and ah it would have meant that there were only going\nA lot of restrictions that were placed on a witch doctors who perform abortions and where and uh it would have meant that there were only going to be a ... like cooking for three or four cities in the state of Texas where someone could obtain an abortion and where\nAh if someone were in West Texas\nThey would have been nearly impossible for them to obtain an uh an abortion the Supreme Court ruled that particular law violated about roe versus Wade and the right to privacy which includes a hundred existing precedent the right to an abortion but it was a five to four opinion uh and so given that it was a five to four opinion\nWith Justice Kennedy or being in the five one would expect a lot of tests about what the new limits\nAre what are the kind of Eisenhower section on abortion here in Georgia and south and general\nSo in the state of Georgia a there's a twenty week abortion ban and a twenty four hour waiting period which is an extremely outside of the norm although in Georgia it used to be twenty four weeks and it was moved to twenty weeks resulted in um some litigation actually\nOutside of the south actually um one of the most restrictive abortion laws in North\nDakota which although it's not currently in a fast because it's been found to be unconstitutional it's a six week a\nBand and that suggests that one of the things that might happen over the next couple of years is that that's one of the ways that states might test the law to try to move the number of weeks earlier and earlier and earlier\nI'm such that you kind of get to a place where for women within meaningfully be able to obtain an abortion things some states\nSo I think that's something certainly to watch\nAnd looking at the tiny Eighteen time there were big decision on public sector unions that with a win for Christian Baker refuse to bake a cake ... wedding on the ground ... pregnancy centers\nComparative the twenty ninth team there may be an attempt to lower the temperature and do you think that in a strategy that chief justice John Roberts and the court is taking\nSo it could be lower the temperature is kind of yours for a political capital standpoint the Supreme Court has a limited capital you know if people feel that the poor is getting too involved in issues that they think belong to\nPolitically accountable bodies um\nUh for some concern terms of the course legitimacy and so I Do think they have to be thoughtful and careful about that\nIt happened on friday kind enough to get\nUh for some concern terms of course legitimacy and so I Do think they have to be awful careful about that\nThe FBI has until friday to investigate allegations against judge Kavanaugh and plans to vote on friday if he is seated and say credible evidence were presented in the future ten Supreme Court justice be removed or impeached from their lifetime appointment\nSo there is a method of because he's been available when there is a cause and it's only been used once so in the early Eighteen hundreds a there was a justice in justice and they'll chase 'em who\nWas understood as being too overtly partisan\nAnd so he was a piece by the house impeached those simply means that the house bill that there's a fishing grounds for the Senate to consider convicting the person than when someone's convicted in their car removed French\nMass associate professor of law at Emory thank you so much for bringing us rent that I
