U. dot edu\nFrom Georgia Public broadcasting this is on second thought I'm Virginia Prescott a year ago this week the New York times were first reported allegations against Harvey Weinstein opening the floodgates for similar accusations of sexual harassment and assault against powerful men in the media film government and other industries\nMillions of people globally went public with their experiences using the hash tag need to opening up conversations between friends and colleagues and neighbors\nSo what are we now how do we talk about sexual assault and how are we teaching our kids about a topic that has become an avoidable with us as Sally shepherd of the cottage in Athens and ... Ga Ga psychology professor Ayesha Mets gr\nKelly I wanted to pick up on something you said that when you speak to people sometimes they called the hotline and they haven't quite wrapped their head around the experience and it was sexual assault do you think we have a shared understanding what sexual assault even is\nNo um I Do not think that we do it's interesting that um I was speaking to someone the other day and we were talking about the below like what is the criminal charges sexual thought what would that entail and how that would be could be vastly differing\nSomeone the other day and we were talking about the the law like what is the criminal charges sexual assault what would that entail and how that would be could be vastly different than what the human experiences a when their body has been violated by another\nLast week's hearings and the Senate Judiciary committee took measures not come off as callous as it was accused as during the Nineteen Ninety One hearing said now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accused of sexual harassment by any to hell [noise]\nDo you think that the conversation has changed significantly since Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill was named out to be um that's actually was cold some sort of sexual deviant\nI had the conversation has changed I feel like it has in the field\nI'm I feel like I'm In the past we used to think of\nPeople who saw other people as is is is like a stranger incident that what happened that you wouldn't exactly notice person\nUm I think now we are talking more about consent\nAnd I think if we choose to teach our young people around us and in our lives about consent and what that means and we are I'm helping them understand appreciation for respect of other people's bodies and not object to find human beings but in fact seeing them as a human so perhaps sex sexual thought would be less likely to occur\nWill so that is a question how we talk about kids how we talk about children not just high school kids not just the kid is going forward to college about sexual assault when should those conversations began\nI feel like they should begin um once [laughter] I'm not quite at first but um [noise]\nLike uh something I've done with my children is when I Would give them a bath when they were very young I Would wash all their body parts and I remember for some reason it's very important for us to teach our kids all the names of their body parts there even songs about body parts of they'll learn the names\nAnd so as you're washing their body parts and\nAlso as you wash their penis or The Vagina let them know the name of their body parts and then as time of all then once they get to an understanding of what touches are to their body than it is important to have a conversation about touches that are okay and not OK\nAnd who is allowed to touch you in certain places and who is not and then you create a safety plan with him about um what to do if that happens and I feel like starting a conversation like that when the child is young will continue into their young teenage years and older teenage years and probably into young adulthood to then you talk about healthy relationships\nConsent and how to make sure that your priorities are known to a partner um and also how to ask a partner\nShips consent and how to make sure that your priorities are known to a partner um and also how to ask a partner at every step of the way if the actions going on between you two is consensual is okay with that person\nKnow that a lot of conversations have\nBeen coming out of ... among women but certainly men I'm teens stories shared of people that I Know and love very well who are men who have been attacked\nAnd we don't want to diminish that experience at all but it is interesting Georgia law\nIs a rape is when a man a sexually assault a woman and the federal law is not a does not confined to men against women in this case a and also then in metro Atlanta that definition is not used\nBut this is an interesting part of the conversation about sexual assault\nThe idea that it is men\nSexually assaulting women how does that change the conversation here in Georgia\nOh that's a good question um I feel like I Know the I Know that in Clark County we have had a mill perpetrators perpetrate on other men I Know that female are able to rape as well um the the sexual thought might be different than my our mind may come up with us to water rape is\nUm but I think that is an important to uh be open and a compassionate to all survivors of sexual assault because sexual assault is what happens to you it's not so much about what you tell\n[laughter] this is a question for both of you it is about what people tell I'm sure you've both seen the video of Jeff Flake of being confronted by protesters women who were deeply emotional about their experiences of sexual assault and his English and you know how it changed his mind\nWe hear about the numbers of sexual assault but how often do we actually get confronted by that experience and how can that be done in a public and healthy way I'd love to hear from both of you\nYou have ... I think that oftentimes sexual assault or not reportage is based on the reaction that a lot of people receive\n'em and I think that we certainly can see that played out in the media today I'm even Dr Ford in her testimony said initially she was hesitant to disclose because she didn't want to say that she was at a party drinking with boys [laughter] um so I I think that certainly um the response is something that um\nDidn't want to say that she was at a party drinking with boys [laughter] um so I I think that certainly um the response is something that I'm may or may not encourage people to tell it may or may not\nInfluence the way that the investigation goes afterwards um [noise] but certainly public response racing\nIn Virginia I think we need to remember that sexual assault is a very intimate experience it happens to a person yes it is a crime but it is not like breaking into someone's car\nThis is someone's body and even though it is a physical crime to their body involved is way more than just the penis and vagina or anything like that it it\nIt really works are pure a person's soul in their spirit when this happens to them and it's so many levels and so many levels of healing and it really obscene it affect a survivors for the rest of their life in different ways\nTo it is a crime that often goes unreported Sally I'm Wondering if you when people come into your center Collier center and say that they have survived a sexual assault do you encourage them to tell their story\nAt the cottage we believe that uh we offer survivors options as to what to do with what has happened to them [noise] um we are an empowerment based agency and so we hope to\nEmpower the clients who reach out to us by letting them know what services are available to them and absolutely that is reporting to law enforcement and if they choose to do that then we will be with them through that process and we will help point them in the right direction as to what jurisdiction they may need to uh to contact the mood that process moving forward\nAnd then we also follow up with therapy for the ... as well because I feel like therapy um is probably just as important as reporting to law enforcement as well but we truly let the survivor and make their own choice\nA much bigger conversation but thank you for eliminating some of it today a social worker\nSally separate executive director of the cottage sets a sexual assault in children's advocacy center in Athens thank you Sally so much that was my pleasure thank you and I shouldn't that skirt she is the University of Georgia psychology professor at thank you Ayesha\nYou're very welcome and thanks for having me just ahead how one sexual assault survivors uses art to heal [noise]\nI Am Virginia Prescott reminding you that your support makes on second thoughts and all of the programs that you hear a gp the possible and right now during our full fund drive at your opportunity to do your part they not up to you what counts most is that we hear from you but he's got a G.
