Marshall project that's a nonprofit news organization cover and criminal justice and the U.S and Morris welcome ... so Rhonda just curious how you got onto the speed and the first place [noise]\nWell it it like a lot of things in my career it was\nThanks for having me so Rhonda just curious how you got onto the speed and the first place [noise]\nWell it it like a lot of things in my career it was all an accident I started covering prisons right out of the box when I became a reporter in Nineteen Seventy seven and it just sort of evolved into this and [noise]\nAh because I covered prisons that led to the death penalty and an execution since they're the ones that carry out the punishment\nAnd the department of corrections ... media witnesses for each execution that's a rule that you felt for dozens over the span of two decades or about their first execution you witness that was in Nineteen Ninety six ... what do you remember about that day\nWhy I don't remember much about the executions I've covered some might argue it's the defensive thing um but I mean you were there to block them out yes and I but I Do remember that is one of the two that I Do remember and it was Larry long shark and he was convicted of a a triple murder\nAnd Larry long shore did not appeal\nIs his conviction he he sort of did right at the last minute but then changed his mind the next day\nAnd I do remember that one that one was electric ... electrocution that I witnessed\nBut um I Do remember that one because it was my first because I knew long shower well because it was an electrocution there are lots of reasons why I remember that one and you said there was another so the other one that I Do remember was Kelly gifts and dinner a couple of years ago\nShe was convicted of having her lover kill her ... her husband\nAnd that one stands out not because uh Kelly gifts and dinners the only woman obscene executed but because she's saying um amazing grace right up to she could no longer sing in that stands out that\nPredate telling it for you as a reporter governed by the principles of objectivity witnessing all those executions leave you with any thoughts about capital punishment in Georgia or otherwise\nBecause I'm not all I wasn't allowed to have those thoughts um Georgia is very efficient\nThey um the closest I've ever come to having a problem was with one of ... not that at the time she was executed by the time before that and they stepped in and stopped it because there was a problem with the drugs it was cold and have been stored at temperatures that we're too cold and the solids in the in the drug habit\nStopped it because there was a problem with the drugs it was cold it had been stored at temperatures that we're too cold and the solids in the in the drug had gone to separate from the liquids and so in an abundance of caution they stopped that execution and he was carrying out about six months later\nBut er Georgia has been drama free they've they've got it\nPretty much down to it as a rhythm to it\nMore he says something you've covered a death penalty stories all over the country Georgia has had about four hundred and Ninety One executions Nineteen twenty four I'm Rhonda mentioned the states can see how how does Georgia compared to other states in terms of just the numbers [noise]\nUm I mean it's kind of right in the middle you know you have states like Texas a carry out many many executions are all those kind of famous culturally for it um and then you have states that\nI've abolish the death penalty totally a you have states that have the death penalty on the books and they symptoms people to death but the sort of gets squeamish about actually carrying out an execution and George is right in the middle and that you know it\nCarries out I'm a maybe kind of execution some years if you are a few more but it's um it's a it's a state that kind of wants to kind of keep the system rotting in a in a kind of efficient way like Ron said a but it also doesn't appear to want to kind of get the reputation of a place like taxes of\nBeing you know bloodthirsty are carrying these out over and over and over again um [noise] I mean there were times you know in other states where there were two a week and I don't know the examples like that in Georgia though ... ... if\nI'm wrong only one that I uh well there's one that I there were a couple that I Do recall in one was that the Larry long shower there was one that came to the very next day and then uh my memory tells me there was another one more recent and um but um those things didn't tend to leave my mind\nAfter they're of course how many on death row now in Georgia\nAround fifty five or six I'm I'm not really sure the number but it's somewhere between fifty and sixty [noise] guy had Murray\nIt's going to say that what happens is you know every state the carriers out executions no matter how many are how few\nEvery once in a while a case kind of pops up in the media and becomes a big deal sometimes it's because of issues with the lethal injection drug is like the ... ... execution or those you know of a ... foot tall separated other cases are it's like Troy Davis where there is a release um clear concern about someone be innocent\nIt was a ... foot tall separated by their cases are it's like Troy Davis where there is a release um clear concern about someone being unison or in a case of ... or a woman do kind of very sympathetic figure and you find that these cases are really kind of travel and the public mind because they\nCould bring up a lot of ambivalence that people might have about the punishment\nThan in her case he was a he was the person who is ... I Believe her lover who actually committed the murder or with convicted now that's that's correct he ... he agreed to a ... and she declined to take the saying she had the same offering she did not take it\nShe went to trial and then the jury can is the death sentence\nPunishment and Marie and they said that you eat a round a mention that first execution electrocution later lethal injection was adopted by the state of Georgia something the Marshall project has done a lot of reporting on it a little bit about some of the complications\nThat said that had entertaining legal injection drug for\nSure so lethal injections became a form of execution um for a lot of states beginning in the Nineteen eighties and continuing up through the nineties and the whole idea was that they would be a sort of more humane way of executing people that it would kind of look more like a clinical stroke hospital setting [noise]\n[noise]\nWhen things are in the balance what goes beyond a reasonable doubt really mean\nTroy Anthony Davis and on showing them on December\nG.

people's data\nClearly our computers are vulnerable Atlanta is one of the fastest growing high tech metro areas in the U.S and now ranks third entities with the most fortune five hundred at headquarters\nAnd this week thousands of cybersecurity experts are going to be gathering at cyber security Atlanta to discuss their concerns about the industry security and a lack of it\nAnd joining me this morning are two cybersecurity experts the events director David juniper is with us and chief hacker Joshua crumble welcome to both\nGovernors thank you All right so David you're the one with the English accent for the for the help of our listeners start with you what are the pay off that hackers are looking for when they go into a computer or networks were I mean now\nThe for the help of our listeners start with you what did they passed that hackers are looking for when they go into a computer or a network\nOr I mean you know or they're trying to do is get\n... to an organization um or an individual so that might be someone else a credit card information or it might be a company's data which can only the old run them for the um or to be sending back information on on the adult with a credit card information et cetera\nSo it doesn't really have this idea that the Kurds are quite nice notorious secretly breaking into systems to steal information or credit card numbers as David mentioned\nYou are the white hat tumor righty of hacker and signing weakness system so what are the chief reasons computers or systems are left vulnerable\nYou know it might be slightly controversial but if my belief that it is completely people that are the reasons that we have so many issues\nTake the the Georgia\nA malware attack Iran somewhere incident that recently happened there were vulnerabilities that were on patched and were well known vulnerabilities on their perimeter that allowed this to happen\nAnd if you take it back even further it's the bad code the insecure coating practices of the developers that cause that to happen as well and so it's my belief that cyber security is really more of a human issue than it is a technical or computer issue\nAnd it's more about changing our society from the ground up to make sure that when we write code for writing it more secure and and when we find out about vulnerabilities that exists within our networks or on a on our perimeter that are public or Internet facing\nThat we get them properly patched and timely manner so that the bad guys the hackers out there they can't exploit those\nAnd they can't exploit our people because people are being more security aware and are paying attention before they just start clicking on things\nHere is the mayor Kesha Lance bottoms talking about that attack specifically\nIs much bigger than a ransom where it really is an attack\nOur government which means is an attack on all of us\nSo what do we know about the people who ended up holding the city for ransom for city by the way declined to pay\nIt you know there uh there's a lot of uh suspicions about who actually was involved in that uh you know I I'm going to the ...\nYou know there are there's a lot of uh suspicions about who actually was involved in that uh you know I I I'm gonna declined to comment because it says a lot of uh a lot of people assuming that they know\nBut what we do know is that they were exploiting known vulnerabilities within systems that really should never have been exposed to the Internet and the first place\nSuch as a remote desktop which is just a way to remotely asked to or a access any computer but if you ask any cyber security professional or ethical hacker they'll tell you that that should be behind a secure system and so it's a it's a hygiene thing that uh that needs to be fixed\nWhich had their public organizations decide CDs are most vulnerable to these kind of a ransomware attacks\nThat's a loaded question on honestly everybody is highly vulnerable to these types of attacks it in my career is unethical hacker I've yet to find a single network or system that I couldn't gain access to take full complete control over\nAnd we're talking anything from pipelines to taking remote control of oil rigs to some of the largest financial institutions and human markets and the world\nAnd so the reality is is where we sit right now\nAny hacker if it were targeted enough could easily breached systems and we're always talking in terms of data breaches and fortunately most cybercrime is financially motivated but if somebody had more nefarious uh\nI I guess purposes or goals\nWe could be talking a loss of life instead of\nJust loss of data or loss of income or loss of reputation and so I think it it's something that we really need to take seriously as a society and understand that with all this new technology that we love it brings new threats and and it brings\nEssentially a war front right to our our front door and its cyber but it can affect us in our everyday life and and that means we need to be more security aware\nOf the day to day and she was saying our lives are increasing the integrated with computers you know thinking of the Internet and everything your smart home device in your car your pacemaker things said he'd be watching television or movies could have I was living in perpetual fear do you live in here\nWhy don't you can kind of thought or otherwise we would we be without it but I think doing things or having a ... just on the um bringing\nOh I don't think you can kind of thought or otherwise we wouldn't we wouldn't be able to move on with our lives but I think doing things or having a events like cyber security Atlanta I'm bringing awareness to decide security not just to no end to ... big companies that we have within the news but making people to where\nYou know on an individual basis or you know making sure as you said you know making sure you patch you compete is making sure that your calls what they're doing everything you can\nAlso you know people all the the biggest weakness within cyber security and so about ... size you all are understanding where those potential weaknesses on educating you'll you'll stop even if your company if you know like the ten people up the multinationals\nThey need to understand where the risks the risk of all I'm and like coming to an event like cybersecurity Atlanta you can learn like threats all you can have for mix but you can see what's coming up and you can talk to the end of the experts\nIn this field a ... you need to do to protect yourself and they both as an organization\nSaid when we hear about a tax on a city of Atlanta for example and I understand that hospitals are also often targeted to a university often targeted\nWe have a sense I think that well I don't know if my data was affected cell and do people really pay enough attention you know like how attacks like this might affect you personally [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think the people do have to\nTake notice a you know like just you know ... with Facebook which is over several people would use that needs to make fuel that you've you've gone back onto Facebook to see if you want to be the account affected and make sure that you thought they it'll all go through that that protocol and ... they recommend that you should do\nSo I think the more that it is it in the media um I think more people will be aware of it and the more that we push to make sure that companies are making sure they uh I tell people if that has been a breach ... they can do whatever they can to protect their data or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "17"}
