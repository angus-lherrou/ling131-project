from the basics to the more controversial is the first day of early voting in Georgia which runs and tell them that aren't per second\nIf you signed up to vote early what do you have to do where do you do it and what the heck is a provisional ballot\nWell here to demystify the processes MIT political science professor Charles Stuart founding director of the MIT election data and science lab which measures how each state does managing national elections Charles welcome thank you\nAnd also with us Aaron hands wax she's an Atlanta native who covers race and ethnicity nationally for the Associated Press she's covered the role of black voters in Georgia upcoming elections among other things and Aaron hello Hi how are you very well thank you both for joining us\nUh both Georgia NATO's by the way we've learned to Charles lab measured state's election performance and categories like absentee ballots provisional ballots and turnout rate so so overall how was Georgia doing\nWell you know Georgia is also um the the the\nLike absentee ballots provisional ballots and turnout rate so so overall how's Georgia doing\nGeorgia is a so um the the the way in which we do this measuring um is through an online publication called the elections performance index and\nWhen we look at the various um indicators in an index and there's about Seventeen of them we find a Georgia actually is about in the middle of all the states in terms of how it performs whether it be in the area of turnout or provisional ballots are absentee ballots Georgia in many ways on election performances about an average they\nMight do want to look at provisional ballots but first Aaron ... what does one way that people can vote in Georgia this is through early voting so what exactly is early voting\nEarly voting is a window a head of the actual election day it can be as\nLate as maybe the weekend before but up to maybe forty five days before the election depending on your state and about two thirds of the country ah allows early voting without an an excuse\nGeorgia being one of them the state where I currently live Pennsylvania does not have early voting it's election day only voting and so citizens in Georgia have the option to cast their ballot starting today and ending a November second\nThey can go to their polling their designated early voting polling place and cast their ballot for the election starting now\nYou said excuse what are some of the reasons that people do choose to or get have reason to vote early\nAbsolutely well because you don't need or even again in Georgia you can do it frankly out of convenience perhaps you're not going to be off work on\nA on the actual day of the election perhaps you're going to be out of town for the actual day of the election perhaps\nYour due date for their child might be the day of the nation I mean there could be any number of reasons why are the actual date of the election doesn't work for you but you have three weeks to go ahead and get it done with with no reason necessary\nSo Charles how does your to compare with other states in turn out for early voting\nOn well Georgia is one of the states that has um the largest use of early voting I'm In the country I mean ranks right up there with Texas in Tennessee which are two other pioneers [noise]\nUm I'm In the use of the mode um in the last presidential election roughly half of Georgians amused the early voting mode um it's been more variable in the mid term um [noise]\nOh I'm In the last presidential election roughly half of Georgians amused the early voting mode um it's been more variable in the mid term ranging from about a quarter of about forty percent and so the question for this election is going to be\nUm whether the campaigns mobilize people early and get those numbers up or whether it will be down in the in the in the twenty five percent range\nDo we know demographically Aaron or Charles who is choosing to vote early here in in Georgia\nYeah ah so I think twenty fourteen I think what we saw with about a thirty three percent of those early votes for African Americans are compared to about sixty one percent of early votes coming from white voters\nAnd so uh you know to\nCharles was point this is definitely something that folks do take advantage of what will be interesting to see uh this year is because ah especially on me\nA democratic side for example with Stacey Abrams because her strategy is revolving around when we came out to so many new voters or either voters who haven't always voted in\nIn a rare as regularly um making sure that those people are aware of the fact that they can vote now uh you know and seeing how that may affect turnout could could make this interesting with somebody new people on the rolls\nAnd not something that you've been watching carefully ah where are these new voters coming from you know George is a big state um big urban populations focussed pretty much in in Atlanta but in other cities how about the rural voters\nVoters are definitely going to factor into this election about a third of ... of rural voters and the state our people of color\nAnd frankly these are people who are because of\nThe here and then during the way that their districts are have been drawn have not always felt like\nThey could make a difference at the local level but state wide elections obviously are not subject to\nAh the rules of gerrymandering so to speak and so uh those people will factor into state wide elections or you know so these are people that that we um\nDon't tend to hear about so much because so much of the focus especially around the black vote tends to be in places like Atlanta clearly but also Albany or savannah are making but there are people in in smaller places to uh you know that are in counties that are majority black that could that could definitely make a difference in this election\nIn smaller places to ah you know ... are in counties that are majority black that could that could definitely make a difference and the election\nAnd under wraps up this idea that early on in Charles there are two ways to vote early absentee ballots by now early in person setting so how does that voters choose which one is right for them\n[noise] well I think um I mean part of his the convenience I'm part of it also is on the assurance that your vote is going to be counted and um the research that I've done and other people have done suggests I Would I Would argue um the suggests that the early voting a mode is probably the more secure and um\nIf you are really somebody who's turning out to vote because you're really committed to your candidate didn't want to make sure your vote counts\nUm the early voting um being in person and gives you a chance to resolve questions both registration and with the ballot at the moment that they occur um absentee voting in it looks like absentee voting in Georgia\nI'm by mail um has continued to be the more traditional people ... um people out of town students et cetera um who really have no other choice then to do it by mail\nHighschool football as a way of wide from the south now school girls will get

the system justified and what happens to your ballot once cast TBB Steven Tyler has gone deep into Georgia's election system beginning at the secretary of state's office which oversees elections\nHarvey is George's elections director as team with the secretary of state's office gets to work building the layout of the ballots as soon as candidates are set our results as creates twenty five hundred different versions of a ballot with everything from the governor's race to weather Sandy Springs residents can buy alcohol earlier on Sundays\nYou take each county and then you take the different ...\nBut everything from the governor's race to weather Sandy Springs residents can buy alcohol earlier on Sundays\nYou take each county and then you take the different ballot combinations and you take the qualified candidates and you just start plugging down into the slots if you if you think about it that way until you've got every\nRace and every question every candidate account for accounting\nSpin those ballad files are hand delivered to each county where local officials double check to make sure everything is accurate once that's done the officials load the ballots from a secure server on to memory cards tied to specific precincts the cards are also matched up to a specific serial number on a specific machine\nEven the seals they used to secure those machines have their serial numbers tracked [noise]\nThat's the sound of a machine being unsealed so it can undergo logic inaccuracy testing it's one of four that belong to the black rock voting precinct in Fayetteville twenty miles south of Atlanta Fayette County elections director Floyd Jones\nOf what we're doing is we're taking the machine where literally ensuring that it actually works and then uploading the new ballots into the machine so they can be prepared to roll out on election\nProcess takes just a few minutes for a machine [noise]\nEverything from the were the print or to the click of the card reader undergo scrutiny and a sample tally is run [noise]\nJones says all three hundred machines as county uses will be tested over the course of several days\nThat's done we Salem we put them back on the racks and we have them for election [noise]\nSo what happens on election day\nThe machines are delivered the seals are broken and poll workers are ready for business at seven AM\nAfter you check in at the polling place you're handed a yellow voter access card that goes inside the machine but how does it know which ballad goes on the screen\nA tiny computer chip what's your name and balance dial loaded on fits the same type a chip that you have on your credit cards that's Richard Baron who oversees Fulton County is elections all the ballots are available on the DARE but that one will only activate\nThe ballot that is correlates to your residence your vote is captured on the machines memory card and the yellow card is returned to the poll worker\nWants the last person in line has voted poll managers consolidate the vote tallies onto a single memory card shut down and seal the voting machines do some paperwork and then drive results to a central\nAnd has voted pull managers consolidate the vote tallies onto a single memory card shut down and seal the voting machines do some paperwork and then drive results to a central location from their vote totals are uploaded to the state's election night reporting system where tallies are posted online\nInsulting which is ... most populous county that takes a while so this year unfold and law enforcement will escort the memory cards from five checking centers to the main elections warehouse but the process isn't over even after candidates declare victory and the website says a hundred percent of precincts are reporting\nHere's Kris Harvey with the secretary of state's office\nSomebody seating or the news calling something has zero effect on anything we do we still have to account for every dollar of his gas and even it doesn't end the morning after the election\nThere's still some mailed an absentee military in overseas ballots that must be counted plus provisional ballots cast on election day counties certify the results by the Monday after the election the state certified as a result a week after that\nBut this could be one of the last time this process has used seven vendors have submitted options to replace Georgia's voting machines and elections infrastructure at the request of a commission set up by the secretary of state Brian Kemp their goal is to have a new system in place for the twenty twenty presidential election\nTeeth and its share with me this morning with more in the mechanics of it is election system and put digging deeper Helen Stephens the morning after right after Richard mellor he's a computer science professor at Georgia Tech welcome itchy eyes thanks thanks so much for being here\nEven at a lot of information that is not just one big counts George aids one hundred and fifty nine county sent their own local tens camp\nSignificant ... between fade away the chat county and Fulton County administer elections that the local level\nSo a lot of things that are similar with how they run elections um there are elections a there's the voting machines that counted they have to have the tally is they have to put them in\nThe ballots are different for each county you know Fulton County has certain elections that are only ... revolt and county and even within Fulton County there are certain elections like cities have different things or different a local options um so the way the counties around there is a hundred and fifty nine counties there's a hundred and fifty nine county elections board\nThere is a hundred and fifty nine different a\nCheck in places that they have full and kind of actually it's five checking centers and so each county kind of runs its own election and has its own volunteer poll\nTrent a check in places that they have full and county actually it's five checking center says so each county kind of run to its own election and has its own volunteer poll workers incessant and things that run within the states larger system\nRight so ... that the question here which you're listening to Stephen story you heard the you know all of the different checkpoints Tony how are you ... do you feel like they don't care way to run an election\nSo it's a very complicated system um it's um technology that that has evolved over the last Thirty years and and frankly speaking has been lashed together or with stopgap measure so so what um what Chris Harvey described I think is from an IT standpoint a real nightmare\nTrying to trying to figure out where the vulnerabilities are what people should trust what they what they should and trust is a is a real issue\nWhere we get from Steve in hiding data channels through ... going down that can deliver aid for and finding out who wins an election come wintertime at the protocols for keeping ...\nWell we we don't think in terms of security so much is trust so as as you as you think about the process of of of um of voting imagine who you're going to vote for going to the the polling place casting a ballot\nOr going home at night watching your beer both be counted um you want to make sure that that that whole chain of advance a has been properly taking care of carry it and and in the case of Georgia is simply that simply hasn't we focus on on specific points in the technology chain\nUh and uh I think that's part of the issue is coming from there's a there's a sense of the weakest link uh is is pretty weak and and people are are frankly concerned about\nMy parents and lie about election security in general terms and it's something that we have heard about already in ... probing network or and so what does that mean\nProbing so um I I like to think about um uh my my kids favorite movie home alone um if you remember I'm home alone the
