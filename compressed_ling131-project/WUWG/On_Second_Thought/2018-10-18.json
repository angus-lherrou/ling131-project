and this was installed in Nineteen sixty seven that's right in the civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about\nHow Richards works fits into that as other African American artists of the time because now as we know there weren't that many working or board relatively few [noise]\nWell it's it's interesting that you say that because I'm One of the things that um my research and my um [noise]\nIf you could say my profession kind of tries to eradicate is the sense that\nThere was an absence of art is there might have been an absence of recognition for many artist of color but there were several artist that we're operating in working I'm particularly in the late sixties and that was actually a watershed period for many\nAnd tried to define um you know their their role in their function I'm In relationship to the civil rights movement um and in other cases just a part of the overall art\nUm world of art itself\nUm I think that Richard stands apart in the sense that um he had already been active as early as the Nineteen fifties um varies quite successful um and you know it was kind of in some cases um seem to be kind of an enigma because he was\nYou know relatively successful but he still had many of the same obstacles um that many of other artist of colors um had at the time in probably continue to have um during this period um but um\nBut Richard was one of those shining stars um he had and early I mean he had early retrospective exhibitions as early as I think he was in his thirties [noise]\nUm one major one moment that took place in Nineteen Seventy one um but they had acquired a sculpture of his I'm entitled Iraq me ... years earlier um so I think one of the things that um\nThis um this particular exhibition demonstrate as how prolific I'm an artist such as Richard ... is um and continues to be um so\nAnd public art is a very particular kind of work either huge pieces that huge outlast material and money obviously I'm ... and Richard for you you have to I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that had to stay how do you think about where they're going to fit in space\nAnd Richard for you you have to I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that had space how do you think about where they're going to fit in space widely back in your city how\nWell let me go back to the beginning you know you mentioned the\nThe first major a commission that I've had for this a mental health center in in a suburb of Chicago Illinois a ... an area\nUh that uh that ... is is kind of a um [noise] I'm a a\nA health care oasis you might say that on one side of the state dental health center is a Heinz veterans hospital across the street is Loyola university's medical center but\nAnyway I mean that's one thing a then going back to\nI ended up doing that I mean people\nAre just are invited a asked to do commission works for either bill ... environments ... like a\nOffice building a hotel a hospital or in a park you know what I mean is is not like a light goes off and he said oh I Want to put a sculpture right right okay so it turns\nOut that uh the uh\nOffer of that commission came from uh the design architect for the project an architect named Walter niche who was a partner at ... the firm Skidmore ... and Merrill Lynch\nLead hurt it outlined [laughter] that's it right for him\nRight and and so um so now ah the thing is I'm a\nWalter ... and his wife dawn Clark niche\nUm who is comptroller state of Illinois at the time and the two of them\nOn their own or a avid collectors of art and particularly contemporary art art or of young up and comic artists aren't as important modern art a artist\nAnd um [noise] uh\nWalter and his wife had\nOur uh artist and I'm a Walter and his wife had\nCollected work of mine who was on exhibit while I was still a student at the art Institute\nWhich are already interrupt

many players that go into a putting together a huge works like this [noise] um\nWell at least we got that point and that is the artist yes it's a lot of enablers\nYes an enabler like Shon yet showing you what do you think you know what are people going to see what do you hope they see when they walk away from Michelle [noise]\nWell you know it's interesting that Richard mentioned um is you know families and in his ongoing interest in music because when we were installing the um [noise]\nMidterms are about a lot of things but mostly they were about the president's Marcia is really a vote for

is a fledgling movement dedicated to putting more local oysters on the table I drink a lot about the eager coalition of people helping to cultivate these brainy by themselves and his book a high low tide Brian ... is a local ... booster and Cal owner of the restaurant chemical house\nMayan are far more desirable than harvesting wild oysters\nAnd the context of a restaurant that serving\nOysters are all bar um yeah I think for the most part that they are I mean we do get wild oysters that are extraordinary that have the you know consistency is that are just shocking and surprising but\nUh for the most part are demographic has a better response to the culture to always just because you can control a new ... all the variables but you can't control consistency to some degree and I think that people who are spending money like consistency they always have an email as well so\nIt's something that I think is probably just more attractive to them when they see it in a restaurant\nThe taste is there a difference in the case that you can discern\nWhat's your profiles change so much that you know if you took a wild or Easter and cultured always joke that we're growing right next to each other and harvest them at the same time\nYou might taste some differences but you might not um you know the biggest difference is it a lot of these orders that are being farmed are being farmed and floating bags in the wild stuff is sitting in the mud so depending on the makeup of that substrate you might get some earthy or qualities\nOut of a wild oyster who's growing and the you know on the sea floor as opposed to something that's growing in a in a basket at the surface of the sea\nBefore you started serving oysters from Georgia did any of your clients ask why they weren't on the menu\n[noise] um we haven't had a ton of people ask where the Georgia or issues were when we first opened we did have a lot of people ask where the um the Florida boisterous war but now that that questions being answered I'm you know I'm kind of encouraging people to ask where are the Georgia or stirs\nAndre among the many characters that we need just in ... when do you credit as the first person to farm Georgia oysters he now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine\nAny character that we need ... splendor you credit as the first person to farm Georgia oysters he now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine extension and Georgia sea grant so what\nDoes that came to start farming oysters and the state\nYou know well he moved down here um to attend grad school in Savannah\nUm and he was already quite obsessive about our culture and oysters you know he had already decided to to make\nA choice of his life and he got down here and I believe he was at a um an oyster roast and was inquiring about where the oysters came from knowing that you know Georgia does have the coast you know he he he will knew that [laughter] down from ... from Michigan\nAnd when he found out they were from away he was flabbergasted because you know he could just take one look at our marshes here and he could see um the the you know the relative lack of development and and just you know it's it was obvious to him that this was prime minister growing grounds\nFollow does your water men down there who works the hundred mile coast they watched him as he went to experimenting with it so how did she developed techniques have oyster farm me\nWell his techniques were based on French method which is used in in various ways it's actually called collecting spat which is the sponsor the oyster the oyster starts spawning in the late spring and do so over the summer\nAnd essentially he was doing what he does now and a hatchery but just out in the wild using plastic um to collect little tiny baby oysters and growing them until they got viable and then moving them into a bags where they could grow fat healthy\nAnd this is essentially just adapting what the oyster does naturally a uh a while the oyster will just find whatever decent surface it can to glom onto even the smallest of you know microscopic grain of sand\nAnd what he was doing he was just calling to gather\nA method that was very well in news around the world and in this country already but because of culture hadn't been introduced to Georgia and was not being allowed to do to regulations he had to do this crazy round about way that\nAdded hours and hours I'm In into his work life but he was dedicated to do it because he he knows that the Georgia waste or something that should return to prominence\nHe said he began with ... the name of his business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so without giving all that effort what staff to pay for it\nIt's business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so without giving all that effort what staff to pay off for him\nWere originally was difficult because he had this ... like I said round about way he had to do that you know it was a little more time intensive than the what is becoming traditional agriculture methods the payoff for him didn't work out for him because you know he lived in Savannah was it wasn't living quite the Waterman life\nUm and had to walk away from it because of the different expenses\nYour book reveals a whole system and not just the people who are harvesting our farming but the research shares the agriculture scientists to work collaboratively with Harvard starts making this or do you make that Georgia selfish business shellfish business competitive that\nHe's a really tense relationship and some places and Brian mentioned cameras caught up in Maine lobstermen and does his daddy and maintain the fisheries there is a pretty contentious relationship how does it work in Georgia I think\nYou could describe as contentious because ... Waterman and there are a special breed um folks who work the water are tough and they're opinionated and they don't like to be pushed around and you know because they're dealing with a of a food business they have to deal with regulators right\nUm and then they then there are these you know the university researchers who were you know they have PHD's you know where these guys went to the school of hard knocks them\nSo they don't quite see eye to eye on everything um and so what that means is that someone working in extension like just the manly um has to kind of one tried slowly and speak a special language and and I think it helps when\nFolks who are trying to eight in the industry have experience in the industry like just ended\nAnd buying for you a lot of your business I Would imagine is about the relationships with us from our farming is that correct\nI mean it is for me um to me I I just feel like when you're\nWhen you're selling a food that people are eating raw I mean you you have to you should always be aware of the the risk of the dangers of eating Raul ... any ... any sort of raw protein [noise]\nUm but you know I I've just always felt like we could eliminate some of the Arab ... some of the risk variables by knowing who are buying from knowing how they how they view knowing what type of steward they were and how they treated their release\nUm and I just feel like the ... at this point in time that\nWe um you know and if it's my opinion it's not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think we'll health has the best or Easter list in the city if not the southeast\nPoint in time that we um you know and if it's my opinion it's not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think we'll health has the best or Easter list in the city if not the southeast and I don't think that that's because I'm capable of picking up a phone or sending an email I think it's because we work with the best farmers\nI imagine you could talk about wasters for a really long time just from hearing you say I could go for a little bit [laughter] I think it had become ... symbol of wealth and ... you know for lack of a better word that\nIf you see a movie scene and they're trying to detect headed the fancy party at oyster shell mhm\n[noise] and that's one of the things that I struggle with because I Wish that it was a a food source that was not alienating from up of a price standpoint I you know hopefully that something that that we can sort of work through as the industry gets a little bit more mature and we're looking for ways to use a use or stirs\nDifferently but yeah I mean you know it's one of the biggest difference between ... oysters and cultured oysters is the fact that you do have to make a pretty large investment in equipment and seed and those sorts of tore items and it's not without a a considerable start up costs\nAnd remind me makes me think of that Irish satirist Jonathan ... he was a bold man that first eight and ... and I think in twenty eight and we can safely say he was a bold man that first farmed and oyster\nAnd Jay this revival surely didn't come easily and but is it a revival how far along is that where do you think that revival of the oyster farming along the Georgia ... is now\nI think you can say that the the ... the a large of a boom is is set to begin\nTo seven point five to ... to ... be news dot org admitted before two o'clock at two o'clock Virginia Prescott assume with on second thought and it's three o'clock it's fresh air coming up this afternoon on your point five GPS laughter letters\nIn Prescott assume with on second thought and it's three o'clock it's fresh air coming up this afternoon on your point five GPS laughter is NPR News station [noise]\nSupport for G.

the world including a new exhibition at the Georgia museum of art anew G s Athens campus\nJohn Harris is one of the curators at that institution and she is with us as well today we should you were born in Chicago but your father was from Georgia did did you visit as a child\nA yes or almost every summer so oh your impression of the south [noise] well the red dirt [laughter] ...\nUh no but uh uh uh my father was born in the heart county and I'm a ... a few remaining cousin who still live there but uh um he he loves a\nA during what they now call the great migration\nCelebrate the hundredth

Galesburg mama's Illinois anyway\nUm [noise] uh so I'm uh\nIn those days vacation consists of a visiting relatives either in rural Georgia or rural Illinois\nAnd um I I I enjoyed my time here\nWhen you're first public sculpture play was commissioned by the John Jay Madden mental health center in Illinois this was installed in Nineteen sixty seven so that's right in the civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about\nHow Richards works fits into that as other African American artists of the time\nThe civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about how Richards works fits into that as other African American artists have the time because now as we know there weren't that many working or bore relatively few [noise]\nWell it's it's interesting that you say that because I'm One of the things that um my research and my um [noise]\nIf you could say my profession kind of tries to eradicate is the sense that\nThere was an absence of art is there might have been an absence of recognition for many artist of color but there were several artist that we're operating in working I'm particularly in the late sixties and that was actually a watershed period for many\nAnd tried to define um you know their their role in their function I'm In relationship to the civil rights movement um and in other cases just part of the overall art\nUm world of art itself\nUm I think that Richard stands apart in the sense that um he had already been active as early as the Nineteen fifties um varies quite successful um and you know it was kind of in some cases um seem to be kind of an enigma because he was\nYou know relatively successful but he still had many of the same obstacles um that many of other artist of colors um\nHad at the time and probably continue to have um during this period um but um\nBut Richard was one of those shining stars um he had and early I mean he had early retrospective exhibitions as early as I think he was in his thirties\nUm one major one moment that took place in Nineteen Seventy one um but they had acquired a sculpture of his I'm entitled Iraq me ... years earlier um so I think one of the things that um\n[noise] this um this particular exhibition demonstrates how prolific I'm an artist such as Richard hunt is um and continues to be um so\n... and public art is a very particular kind of work these are huge a peace is a huge outlast material and money obviously\nOn and and Richard for you you have to I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that had they how do you think about where they're going to fit in space while you're there in your studio\n... let me go back to the beginning you know you mentioned the\nHow do you think about where they're going to fit in space washing back in Studio\n... let me go back to the beginning you know you mentioned the\nThe first major a commission that I had for this a mental health center in in a suburb of Chicago Illinois a ... an area\nUh that uh that ... is is kind of a um [noise] I'm a a\nA health care oasis you might say that on one side of the state dental health center is a Heinz veterans hospital across the street is Loyola university's medical center but anyway I mean that's one thing they\nAre then going back to\nI ended up doing that I mean people\nAre just are\nInvited a asked\nTo do commission works for either built environments yellow like a office building a hotel or a hospital or in a park you know what I mean this is not like a light goes off and he said oh I Want to put a sculpture rank right okay so it turns\nOut that uh the uh\nOffer of that commission came from uh the design architects for the project an architect named Walter net ... who was a partner at ... the firm Skidmore ... and Merrill Lynch we heard of that one that said right for him right\nAnd and so um so now ah the thing is I'm a Walter\n... and his wife dawn Clark ...\nUm who is comptroller state of Illinois at the

Prescott\nAround a campfire at Georgia State parks information and rates available at visit gee a state parks dot org dishes on\nSecond thought I'm thinking of Prescott for decades restaurants considered Georgia only stairs more trouble than they were worth\nBad or Easter aquaculture as a fledgling movement dedicated to putting more local oysters on the table I drink a lot about the either coalition that people helping to cultivate these brainy by valves and his book a high low tide Brian ... is a local ... booster and ... of the restaurant chemical house\nMayan are far more desirable than harvested wild oysters\nAnd the context of a restaurant that serving\n... at a raw bar um yeah I think for the most part that they are I mean we do get wild oysters that extraordinary that have a you know consistency is that are just shocking and surprising but\nUh for the most part are demographic has a better response to the culture to always just because you can control a new not all the variables but you can't control consistency to some degree and I think that people who are spending money like consistency they always have an email as well so\nIt's something that I think is probably just more attractive to them when they see it in a restaurant\nHow about the case is there a difference in the case that you can discern\nWhat's your profiles change so much that you know if you took a while or Easter and cultured always do that we're growing right next to each other and harvest them at the same time\nYou might taste some differences but you might not um you know the biggest difference is it a lot of these wasters that are being farmed are being farmed and floating bags in the wild stuff is sitting in the mud so depending on the makeup of that substrate you might get sunlight earthy or qualities\nOut of a wild oyster who's growing and the you know on the sea floor as opposed to something that's growing in a in a basket at the surface of the sea\nBefore you started serving oysters from joined said did any of your clients ask why they weren't on the menu\n[noise] um we haven't had a ton of people ask where the Georgia or issues were when we first opened we did have a lot of people ask where the uh the Florida boisterous war but now that that questions being answered I'm you know I'm kind of encouraging people to ask where are the Georgia or stirs\nAndre among the many characters that we need Justin ... splendor you credit as the first person to farm Georgia oysters he now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine extension and Georgia sea grant so what\nHas asked him to start farming oysters and\nHe now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine extension and Georgia sea grant so what\nDoes that came to start farming oysters and the state\nYou know well he moved down here um to attend grad school in Savannah\nUm and he was already quite obsessive about our culture and oysters you know he had already decided to to make\nA choice of his life and she got down here and I believe he was at a um an oyster roast and was inquiring about where the oysters came from knowing that you know Georgia does have the coast you know he he he will knew that down from from Michigan\nAnd when he found out they were from away he was flabbergasted because you know he could just take one look at our marshes here and he could see um the the you know the relative lack of development and and just you know it's it was obvious to him that this was prime moisture growing grounds\nFollow does your water men down there who works the hundred mile coast they watched him as he went to experimenting with it [noise] so how did she developed techniques have oyster farm me\nWell his techniques were based on a French method which is used in in various ways it's actually called collecting spat which is the sponsor the oyster the oyster starts spawning in the late spring and do so over the summer\nAnd essentially he was doing what he does now in a hatchery but just out in the wild using plastic um to collect little tiny baby oysters and growing them until they got viable and then moving them into a bags where they could grow fat and healthy\nAnd this is essentially just adapting what the oyster does naturally have a a a while the oyster will just find whatever decent surface it can to glom onto even the smallest of you know microscopic grain of sand\nAnd it would have been doing it was just calling to gather\nA method that was very well in news around the world and in this country already but because of culture hadn't been introduced to Georgia and was not being allowed to do to regulations he had to do this crazy round about way that\nAdded hours and hours I'm In into his work life but he was dedicated to do it because he he knows that the Georgia waste or something that should return to prominence and he said he\nBegan with ... the name of his business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so without giving all that effort on what staff\nTo pay off for him ... originally was difficult because he had this ... like I said round about way hits\nAnd all that effort what staff\nWill pay off for him ... originally was difficult because he had this ... like I said round about way he had to do that you know it was a little more time intensive than the what is becoming a traditional agriculture methods\nThe path for him didn't work out for him because you know he lived in Savannah was it wasn't living quite the bottom in life\nUm and had to walk away from it because of the different expenses\nYour book reveals a whole system and not just the people who are harvesting our farming but the research shares the agriculture scientists to work collaboratively with Harvard starts making this or do you make the Georgia selfish business shellfish business competitive that\nIsn't really tense relationship and some places and Brian mentioned cameras caught up in Maine lobstermen and does his daddy and maintain the fisheries there is it pretty contentious relationship how does it work in Georgia\nI think you could describe it as contentious because eat Waterman and there are a special breed um folks at work the water are tough and they're opinionated and they don't like to be pushed around and you know because they're dealing with a of a food business they have to deal with regulators right\nUm and then the then there are these you know the university researchers who were you know they have PHD's you know where these guys went to the school of hard knocks them\nSo they don't quite see eye to eye on everything um and so what that means is that someone working an extension like just a manly um has to kind of one tried slowly and speak a special language and and I think it helps when\nFolks who are trying to eight in the industry have experience in the industry like Justin dead\nAnd Brian for you a lot of your business I Would imagine is about the relationships with us from our farming is that correct\nI mean it is for me um to me uh I just feel like when you're\nWhen you're selling of food that people are eating raw I mean you you have to you should always be aware of the the risk of the dangers of eating Rob ... any any sort of raw protein\nUm but you know I I've just always felt like we could eliminate some of the of Arab ... some of the risk variables by knowing who are buying from knowing how they how they would be knowing what type of steward they were and how they treated their release\nUm and I just feel like the ... at this point in time that\nWe um you know and it's it's my opinion it's not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think it will help has the best or Easter list in the city if not the southeast and I don't think that that's because\nI'm capable of picking up a phone or sending an email I think it's because we\nHow has the best ... list in the city if not the southeast and I don't think that that's because I'm capable of picking up a phone or sending an email I think it's because we work with the\nBest farmers I imagine you could talk about wasters for a really long time just from hearing you say I could go for a little bit [laughter]\nI think ... had become this symbol of wealth and ... you know for lack of a better word that if you see a movie scene and they're trying to detect headed the fancy party at oyster shell mhm\n[noise] and that's one of the things that I struggle with because I Wish that it was a a food source that was not alienating from up of a price standpoint I you know hopefully that something that that we can sort of work through as the industry gets a little bit more mature\nAnd we're looking for ways to use a use or stirs differently but yeah I mean you know it's one of the biggest difference between ... oysters and cultured soy Sears is the fact that you do have to make a\nPretty large investment and equipment and the and those sorts of tore items and it's not without a a considerable start up costs\nAnd remind me makes me think that Irish satirist Jonathan ... he was a bold man that first eight and ... and I think in twenty eight and we can safely say he was a bold man at first farmed and oyster\nAnd Jay this revival surely didn't come easily and but is it a revival how far along is that where do you think that we're vital of the oyster farming along the Georgia ... is now\nI think you can say that the the the a large of a boom is is set to begin", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "18"}
