gender and power here with a primer on this history is Sarah Juliet LRO assistant professor of hemispheric literature at the University of Tampa as well as an author\nOr a book the transatlantic zombies slavery rebellion and living deaths\nExplores the transatlantic slave trade as the historical center of this on the narrative Sarah thank you so much for being here it's my pleasure\nThat is such a big title and I found researching researching\nThis topic so much is on be related academic literature your book of course also race suppression and is on the uh essays on cross cultural appropriations of the Caribbean traditions zombies a cultural history generations zombie goes on and on\nHow did this pop culture phenomenon become a college course or\nTheories series of courses in Sunday's studies\nI think that my interest in those on be really came about after I started seeing this incredible surge of of popularity in terms of zombies and I'll just give you what I think is\nThe most signal example was bizarre to be walked phenomenon started around two thousand and three and really\nJust caught on like wildfire and started to dwindle around two thousand and eight but it was the phenomenon where people were dressing up as zombies and showing up in public often completely unrelated to Halloween in may and June all year round\nAnd I thought why is what is happening why why is this imagery resonating so deeply with people right now so I think that the other academics who studied zombies like me\nSort of felt that through popular culture people have a means of\nSpeaking and a kind of different language the language of symbols and that something was happening at the turn of the millennium and we followed suit to study that phenomenon what do you think it was I mean I Know you've done a lot of study on it and may not be easy to summarize but ah\nThey're mere headline thought on that\nI think I can summarize that actually so I I there are a lot of other scholars and everybody has an opinion some people say they think it was deeply related to nine eleven other people but a very popular idea is that it has to do with economic downturn\nEspecially because as you noted is the first surge of popularity occurred in the Nineteen thirties with the great depression\nUm they could be something more and more\nEspecially because as you noted is the first surge of popularity occurred in the Nineteen thirties with the great depression [noise]\nUm they could be something more and more ... like the change from the millennium and just a general sort of in just a dissatisfaction with the way that ... humanity was headed\nUm I personally think that there was there was a lot of different things happening at the time and\nThey generally we gravitate towards the imagery of his army when we feel this empowered um if you just think it's most simple form I was on the as a living corps because as I said he especially before it became violent before it became a cannibal before it became contagious\nZombie was really just a dead body that had been raised from his grave by a witch doctor\nAnd so that is just such a symbol of this empowerment it's life continuing to slog on I'm In a really does empowered states so I think we as a culture and I I Would say you know it it really was a worldwide phenomenon that must have just been something hum in the air throughout the globe\nUm felt so does that the people in power weren't listening to us\nThat that's why this on me it was so popular at that time what why those early on they fill in the Nineteen thirties\nSo that first wave of zombie film really came out of historically um the u._s. occupation of Haiti a there was a political occupation of Haiti from Nineteen Fifteen to Nineteen thirty four\nAnd I'm as a result of that long period when we had troops overseas a lot of people were coming back from Haiti and writing memoirs telling stories of dead men working in the cane fields as William Seabrook\nWrote in his book the magic island that's chilling yes it is chilling and that's exactly the reaction that Hollywood directors had when they sort of started coming across this material whether it be\nIn a sort of pseudo anthropological tax like ... or whether it was in just these autobiographies from Marines who had been stationed um in Haiti\nAnd the idea that um that there was this folklore figure of um a living corps in Haiti was something that immediately Hollywood just grabbed onto and said oh this is something uh you know we can we can make good with this this chilling exactly as you said\nSo that first wave of zombie cinema still very much keep to the original mythology um it they're still Lou do implied there\nAnd he said so that first wave of zombie cinema still very much keep to the original mythology um it they're still Lou do implied there's there are as the courses that are raised are are very powerless um they might in some of the films turned against their master but they tend to be fabled or a far cry\nFrom the millennials on base that we have that are there are fast that are scary that are carrying fluctuate with her teeth\nSo the whole story of how we get from that first um does empowered zombie in Nineteen thirty four to the truly terrifying zombie though that um were haunted by today is a very big subject too much to tackle in this conversation but it is something that I've written about in my book and um that other people as you noted have written about as well\nSo it really caught on during a deeply anxious time in American history the great depression and we're both noted people weren't really sure what their next meal is coming from and the entire country's future was influx\nStill besides being this creepy folklore figure brought from elsewhere what ... do to kind of capture that cultural feeling of anxiety\nOh I'm Liam living host of MORNING EDITION here on eighty eight point five Harry and Meghan

I'm saying that properly\nInfectious diseases and knows something that we don't know how likely the outbreak\nI I I wouldn't put any money on it and Vegas when do you think that scientists have scientists have appropriated that part of popular culture what to communicate to the masses as that's what it's about\nI think I think it's a convenient tool I think that um this I'll be preparedness is a good way to talk about preparedness for other things that might be too painful to actually think about like a mass shooter\nUm if we're kind of trying to look into the future and St ... what's going to happen now in the field of zombies I wouldn't say that zombies are going to step off the silver screen out of the television set\nAnd and to our real lives but I Do try to guess at what the next evolution and zombies is going to be\nAnd I have to say I'm I think it's going to be zombies who can wield guns historically it's been very rare that zombies can use any kind of tool other than Iraq or a club that they might happen to to pick up but I think we're so plagued right now um\nThat ... can use any kind of tool other than Iraq or a club that they might happen to to pick up but I think we're so plagued right now I'm by these epidemics have mass shootings that I Would be really surprised if someone doesn't\nMake a zombie narrative soon um that's about zombies getting their hands on guns and just wielding mass destruction\nAnd I'm thinking about the zombie popularity reaching the crescendo in the late sixties and early seventies and then dropping off in the eighties so what was happening culturally that capital and behind their graves at that time\nThat's a great question I'm not sure I have a satisfactory answer for you accept that I Do think I mean they're just they're they're ebbs and flows along a lot of people think it just has to do with trends in popularity but I I really go back to the fact that\nIn the new millennium was undeniable that there was a resurgence there was a zombie boom and I think that once once we had sort of bigger fish to fry as a society\nBecame less popular to to dress up as ... and go out into the public sphere of for example I think that you know most recently a lot of those same people who are dressing up as armies\nIn two thousand six has been actually just going out and their regular clothes and protesting on the weekends or they've been um you know registering people to vote they've been actually acting out politically whereas ... kind of this place holder for me for political action\nDoes on me is an image that's most resonant when you feel unhappy but there's not a darn thing you can do about it\nSo I think right now we're in a mode where where obviously people aren't happy right now in this country on for a variety of different reasons but they're not feeling does empowered they're feeling like there are steps that they can take\nMy personal prognostications is that um if we continue if we end up feeling that democracy is no longer working that our votes are really not being counted\nThat we really don't have a say in government that the people we send to Washington to vote how we want to vote are just doing their own thing\nUh I think we're going to see another zombie rise math so that's\nDump the idea that rather than people being ... like George Romero living in this culture that has permeated with zombies and they just pick up the zombie thing that they were actually dressing up as zombies as some form of protest I Do I think it was almost like\nIs permeated with zombies and they just pick up the zombie thing that they were actually dressing up as ... as some form of protest I Do I think it was almost like a practice for protest it wasn't it was an act of protest it was sort of I think I called it a dress rehearsal for protest it was saying\nYou know we ... if we wanted to we could organize we could show up here at a specific time and place and there would be ... of us so it wasn't a protest it had no commentary it had nothing actually that that is to say these on be moms\nBut um but I now and nowadays I feel like people do have things to say and they're finding a variety of different ways to express themselves\nI Wonder if on your trips to Haiti or reading those early accounts those journals brought back from Haiti to the U.S from soldiers best scary stories that you've heard in your studies\n...
