I'm more\nI'm aware of what you're doing because you never know what could be going on behind closed doors\nCertainly the horror and fantasy films genre is huge but they're often these big Hollywood\nAnd uh because you never know what could be going on behind closed doors\nWell certainly the horror and fantasy film genre is huge but they're often these big Hollywood productions well do you want to make one like that you know CGI and effects and all that kind of stuff\nAbsolutely um that actually is only one of twelve characters are so far the ocean was so uh there's a little bit more um hitting behind a door is in those places that I Would love to bring out\nRight and there are fifty foot film festivals ahead of you but where other places where you can get these films shown\nUp with the Bush ... has been shown an over thirty so first of all so far all bravo thank you so much for for a harder to accomplish um we did comic loser which was where he was from Texas or with the dragon which was actually out here in Atlanta Georgia and\nWe've done a couple of festivals in Spain um England as well and um my theory is\nNot so great to see that there is a big market for those and there is in the ... one of the kind of I guess vehicles is a little stuffed toy which is also in the film Mr smiles another film featured there ah which could scare the daylights out of\nWell that means that these these key into our fears thinking of I'm\nLiving nightmare that's another film as being shown it's paste based on three people's actual nightmares one is just terrifying um\nI Will not give it away but say there is that moment in the in in the nightmare that you cannot screen you were able to screen what makes these little smaller scale films so exciting to you [noise]\nWell for one thing it it leaves the filmmakers to be as creative as they want to be they're not under this umbrella of having to produce something that's going to be commercially viable\nSo they can really let their imaginations run wild and they're they're only worried about the creative a message that they are putting out so they really have total control over what they're able to do\nAnd on the living nightmare film that you just referred to it was interesting because uh you watch the film that there's no dialogue in it so this particular filmmaker John Gabriel really wanted people to feel like they were the ones having the nightmare not and you were watching someone else's nightmare\nAnd I thought he did a very good job with the visuals um portraying that were it was so creepy because you felt like that is what my nightmare would look like not somebody\nAnd he did a very good job with the visuals own portraying that were it was so creepy because you felt like that is what my nightmare would look like not somebody else's but that's just an example of what being an independent filmmaker allows you to do without worrying about a studio\nWell there will be things that people see that are familiar to locals a no time for a loved one of the character lives out by the big chicken early\nAnd then there's a film called residents and I know six and it shows a house with those yellow street number science characteristic of Grant Park here's a little clip from that [noise]\n\n\nBy behind [noise]\nYou've done this film festival for how do people respond when they see those familiar landmarks\nThey always say I know where does that yeah\nI Know where that is that interesting with this particular one residents nine of six was filmed primarily with all female cast and crew in only four brave guys\nSo they put it worked on it was produced by a ship price and directed by had their ... and they're really proud of that is a premier screening for it and I'm really excited for people to see it\nToo when you were what what's the process for you do jury these films do you ask for filmmakers like female filmmakers in particular to submit their phone\nWell we didn't ask and particular for females but we do ... we do want a selection of films that have a high quality of filmmaking techniques that demonstrated a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "29"}
