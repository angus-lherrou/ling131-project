which makes new examination of separatists him as a means of protecting African American culture all the more provocative\nSt Louis university law professor Anders walk or make the argument that contemporary ideas about diversity came from arguments against integration championed by twenty century white writers and influential black intellectuals they caught up with him to foreign event\nThe arguments against integration championed by twentieth century white writers and influential black intellectuals they caught up with him for an event at the Jimmy Carter presidential library to talk about his book the burning house Jim Crow and the making of modern America\nI asked him about that title the burning house which is a term that was used both by James Baldwin and William Faulkner that mold when I like the N. double ACP challenge the idea that assimilation should be the goal for African Americans so what was Baldwin argument\nSo James Baldwin came from a tradition of very critical thinking about the United states or his family left the south moved to New York\nAnd he rankled that the idea that the solution to racial injustice in America was to assimilate African Americans into mainstream white society this was the holding and brown versus board of education in Nineteen fifty four\nAnd Bob and said wait a minute why should we want to assimilate into white society maybe whites could learn from our history and our traditions white America's a burning house\nThe other African American writers or Ralph Ellison Zora Neil Hurston you quote on the book and write about them and detail intellectuals and leaders argued that forced integration\nInspired art like jazz and blues and created a resilience and separate Folkways among African Americans was that an argument for Jim Crow\nIt was so uh as early as Eighteen nineties news south boosters like Henry ... here in Georgia Charles Bradley Koch in North Carolina\nArgued and this was the aspirational case for segregation\nSure it also included this franchise when and discrimination but a lot of progressive said this system of separating the races as going to create a diverse society African Americans and whites will create their own institutions their own traditions their own schools even though and art\nAnd this will enable us to live in harmony to work closely side by side but also to preserve our separate identities\nTill it Henry Grady mansion argued that African Americans they didn't need to be absorbed into Anglo saxon culture and could develop their own with an idea of just by cultural parallel societies living side by side\nAt was and it was a right hand turn away from what had been going on in the south before the civil war before the civil war they aspirational case for the legal system of slavery\nIt was a right hand turn away from what had been going on in the south before the civil war\nHarvard can do what it wants it can discriminate so long as it has a legitimate pedagogical reason it really wants to bring in students have different perspectives different views and if at Harvard's mind that includes race that's fine\nHe pointed at ... among others have talked about the need for racially autonomy space you know for safety and for liberation\nAnd these were early twentieth century intellectuals their mid ... century intellectuals writing at a time like hip hop or Michael Jordan are Colin Powell were virtually on matching up all\nHell why didn't they re examination at that time tell us today\nBut I think it\nUs to tell a different story about American history\nAnd a lot of ways the south saves America and the Nineteen twenties the United states was going down to very dark road we were trying to create to support an Anglo saxon Protestant society there was this basic view that the American stock was Anglo saxon Protestant northern European\nMax Weber's Protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism convince people that America's the capitalist country was successful precisely because Anglo saxon Protestants had built it we enact strict immigration restrictions to keep out\nImmigrants from southern central Europe menu from a Catholic we enact prohibition to assimilate Catholic immigrants into Protestant society to Costa drinking cultures we support eugenics most states had forced sterilization rules for people who are feeble minded\nSo just as a homes in his famous statement at three generations themselves are enough supports this idea of forced sterilization\nAll of these things were pushing us towards the ... a road where we were embracing genetics immigration restrictions creating a ... a kind of\nRace civilized nation so much so that the Germans started taking notes from us in the Nineteen twenties and thirties uh Adolph Hitler and his men more my struggle to my top talks about the United states as an area nation it had used immigration law to keep\nThe United states northern European it'd removed all indigenous people I Native Americans\nStates as an area nation it had used immigration law to keep\nThe United states northern European it'd removed all indigenous people I Native Americans he then appoints lawyers to study American law\nThey like the mandatory sterilization laws they liked the immigration restrictions they liked bans on interracial marriage but the one thing they reject desegregation ...\nThey say segregation is not going to work for us it's not going to enable us to create an area and state because that'll mean that minorities do as Germans will have their own institutions their own traditions their own society and the undermined what we're trying to do\nIn a way that's what happens African Americans successfully by the end of World War two\nNot only indoor Jim Crow they didn't prevail they emerge some of the most eloquent exponential of American ideals but those ideals mention nothing about [noise] Anglo saxon Protestant supremacy their ideals about equality racial justice opportunity democracy\nAnd if we think of America in American history through this lens then the south\nThanks in part to Jim Crow but also to the African American experience

returning to my conversation with Anders Walker author of the burning house Jim Crow in the making of modern America\nWalker is a legal scholar but his book points to arguments made by writers and intellectuals in the twentieth century against integration and these notions read as offensive and flatly racist\nBut Walker proposes that by excavating them and putting them and historic context reveals more about the roots of pluralism embedded in American culture and eventually law\nWell he's got to prove that to me before the break we talked about the Gulf between concepts of coexistence championed by white southern writers like Robert Penn Warren who want it to protect their once dominant culture\nAnd black intellectuals like James Baldwin and Zora Neil Hurston who sought a level of separate ... that would protect their culture a culture that had been violently suppressed so\nBack to enter the walk and then how does this idea of preserving culturally identities figure into the current debate over Confederate monuments for example the idea that\nMany of them as we know were built in during the civil rights movement in opposition to the civil rights movement as symbols of cultural heritage yet a lot of people contemporary southerners hold on to them as symbols of their cultural heritage\nWells that have such as Robert ... I think we have such as in my book [laughter] and I think that aspect of southern history as something that the south can double down on them and I think that's something we should commemorate and\nI think Confederate statues if they're contextualize correctly are important historical markers precisely because they emerged much later than the civil war Nineteen terms\nIn federal statutes if they're contextualize correctly\nAre important historical markers precisely because they emerged much later than the civil war Nineteen tens Nineteen twenties and in a weird way if you think about it to commemorate civil war leaders in the Nineteen twenties wasn't middle finger not just it's civil rights activists to but at the federal government so\nI think that we said we should rethink southern history and I think this tradition of diversity of something positive I think we should abandon the idea and actually reject the idea that the south had anything to do with the kind of ethnic nationalism that was going on in Europe\n... and ... and multiculturalism become I hated reading northern liberal than even cosmopolitan is more sophistication among I Know I Wonder if that meant for the division of northern and southern culture\nSo the way most people think of multiculturalism and diversity is that these are ways to achieve integration these are ways to kind of achieve a plural society and that tradition\nAs far as I can tell really comes from other places Canada's lunch so candidate began to develop a discourse of multiculturalism to deal with the French threat of secession and so candidate began to talk about a different kind of society pluralistic society there was also about quality\nNow the one thing that Lewis F tile junior does not do is talk about equality and in a string of opinions have rarely shuts the door on things like affirmative action reparations a aggressive measures to achieve racial balance of schools\nHe strikes down bussing across school district lines and in that sense that say southern legacy\nWhich is yes on diversity but no on government programs to achieve a quality\nAnd that we could say is a negative but the thing is Paolo writes the big opinion so he is really the source\nAnd it this is a price that history that a lot of people don't know about no matter where you live you learn about the civil rights movement or at least can sound the broad outlines and the idea that America is supposed to be ... and ...\nThat have you had any backlash from presenting the whole point of view and his book\nWell I I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century and in fact people have been opened in my argument and I think it's because millennials younger Americans are over the moment where we\nAnd in fact people have been open to my argument and I think it's because\nMillennials younger Americans are over the moment where we believed full assimilation into mainstream white society was the way to go and I think now of all times not just due to black lives matter the movement for black lives but the Trump presidency\nThis is a low point for white folks in this country the Trump presidency is confirming many of the fears and many people had\nThat white people in America are native is their anti immigrant they're fearful of integration their feel fearful of new ideas and if you look at the contrast between the Obama presidency and the Trump presidency the Obama presidency seems to be more aspirational more laudable and forward looking and less riddled with fear and\nParanoia and in a weird way I think folks like Tallahassee coats have responded to this and said white Americans of burning house we need to think more carefully about whether we want to integrate into it that\nAnd then just sort of like buy kismet encountered again when I was just digging for eclectic weird stuff at a record store was that habit a digging for aquatic where it's stuff that records are kinda I I remember on that particular day I went into walks tree records in Decatur, Georgia still a very beloved record store for me\nAnd that just like yeah just with the intention of I'm finding something that would like it seemed like a really cool obscure reference for me to drop in the future [laughter] you know I'm a teenager and trying to cultivate I don't know his personality\nThat's a musician a John who are through the magic of radio is with us now but when you hear this she will be living in Los Angeles she's actually going to come back to Atlanta next month on tour for her new album which is called water music well a couple of years ago ... band performed at the early and you got to perform with them out of that how did that come together\nMy God those maybe one of the very coolest thing just happened to me and my life\nUm I have a great relationship with the URL they have always been very kind to me over the years and I just sort of begged them it was like can I please ... to choose and they were like yeah that makes sense for the end [laughter] so uh so that happened\nAnd to them I was like can I please ... Jews\nAnd they're like yeah that makes sense because the answer [laughter]\nSo ah so that happened in what came of it was um the the original founding member who is in that version the band says she does listen to my whole set he reportedly cried during when I sit in front of the sound engineer as their enjoyed my music\nAnd then he brought me up on stage for their encore song which was um one of the first songs by them I'd ever heard anything fancy\nAnd I like wept on stage singing it with them\nAnd triumphant beautiful moment ah after that we stayed in touch and he actually asked me to join the band wow and uh how was oh God it was so insane I was getting like my visa ready to go to Brazil unrehearsed with them\nAnd it would have been my first time going to Brazil it ever a as a member of my favorite band of all time and then unfortunately it just kind of fell apart their tour plans just didn't materialize the way they were supposed to and that plan just kinda dissolved sadly\nBut you still had your your cry fest onstage at the early\nYears yeah and I got to know that uh that was what I just thought of me in that way as kind of a member of the family and that I don't know it's just something I'll treasure\nForever that's beautiful and you do thing in Portuguese or at least you did on your last record ... not on this one so why not\nUh yeah it it's sort of um as soon as just happenstance but I often do right and sing in Portuguese uh I like to think of the language is sort of another instrument [noise]\nBut um as it happened with the ... the songs on this record a lot of my head space was more in kind of an American soul music from the seventies and eighties and also I'm drifting more these days towards composing\nA within intention to be more just sort of directly communicative with my audience and most of my audience is still at this point English speaking ... um [noise]\nSo I'm kinda working a little bit harder on like the stories and what am I telling you and does it matter to you and things like that um but there is a song on the new record that's in French\nUh it's called ...\n... ah yeah also my mother and your ... either one depending on high school there are so it's a love letter to the ocean\nWondering if you if there's a kind of a different version of yourself in a singer songwriter or person\nEach of those languages can you inhabit something else and another thing yeah\nActually sometimes I use it to like this guy is a little bit\nLike if I'm writing about something that's I don't know that I'm just not really ready to\nTell you an English I can kind of have the little secret but no one who knows me well really you know decipher like especially there are a couple of really sad songs that I've written and I don't really like to be publicly sad\nI feel like it gives too much power to the thing that hurts and and I kind of stand by that even though I Know it's not what like a yoga teacher would tell me to do [laughter]\nTo say to these on their act with the human side and\nUm do I feel like I'm doing my version of that but then I have a couple of songs that are in ... that are about something just really personal and really sad and it helps me record it and I remember it and if you care enough you can you know to say for it and share that experience with me but\nIt's still kinda belongs to me in a way so there's a\nLittle bit of a mask that I mean I I mean in the artistic sense or not yeah thing that you're being phony or anything like that\nWhich gets cast aside and your new record water music the first single year the friend that water music album is called your habitat could you say your habitat for I Would love to be\n...\n[noise]\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nHabitat legs in\nMumbai we're none\nClauses I\nMade\nA living here\nMake a living\nYou know\nThey can tell me oh you could just be and we didn't\nKnow\nYou could then the second thing is\nYou know maybe\nYou did to me and I'm\nYou know\nTapping\nBig emphasis\nOn your habitat and performed here in the DVD studio by a drawn from her record called water music\nI Love that ... and if you have trouble believing in the sentiment at this time you can pretend it's the second day yet so that calls to mind for me a sort of slightly faded a film clips of couples walking along over bridges where the leaves fall down and yeah the onset of\n... what about like that intro credit you know that Cooper bold followed [laughter] yeah yeah some some bell bottoms in there somewhere that kind of thing what\nSeventies that ... is it that does that sort of California Sound of music maybe I feel like to me there's the embrace of the sentimental\nIn that area that I relate to\nA guy that we got a little bit jaded about sentimentality after that for sure yeah and I feel like it's starting to come back a little bit I feel like the kind of um [noise]\nThe the craze for like distance irony of the nineties and to thousands is like just starting to dissipate a little bit and ... I Know a lot of my friends are into some like very very earnest ... you know on the sleeve music nowadays which is refreshing well beyond the singing\nI and I hear that Joni Mitchell phrasing a little bit in there you said you were really a court and spark was a big record it really is the only thing that you make a lot of sounds you didn't and this one but whistle that that sounds less\nWe're really a court and spark was a big record it really is beyond thinking that you make a lot of sounds you didn't and this one but whistle that that sounds less humid and more like a tropical bird how did you discover your talent for whistling\nI'm great question I have no idea\n... I cannot remember starting to do that um I Will offer that I'm just sort of a person who habitually and it sounds all the time [laughter]\nUm weather just like in the car in the shower I'm just sort of like screwing around with just like sounds all the time so have a quite a few like weird little parlor tricks up my sleeves but whistling as one of my favorites and I\nI don't know maybe in my teens I just started doing it all the time can you can you whistle on command which you\nKnow sure [noise]\n\n\n[laughter] ... thank you [laughter] you could you could you and Andrew Bird you know the ... so yeah he's a fantastic Whistler I'm aware I've actually publically offered to um battle him and with Lincoln and that offers stands but if he if he takes me up on\nThe war and to end this could happen [laughter]\nSo when this conversation does air we mentioned you're going to be in Los Angeles I'm your music is I think ... for another era in many ways and for Brazilian music from the Nineteen sixties and do you think you'll feel nostalgic for Atlanta\nAbsolutely yeah I Love Atlanta very much and um it's bittersweet tearing myself away from it because it let it has been so good to me um and show me so much support um during my time here", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "14"}
