Philly influence you in in your acting career fields ... and ... and influence at all or\nComing from Philly I think we were taught to ah [noise] you have this hustle about us in in in a row out and have this insane work ethic to go out and get what we want and I definitely helped me entering into the industry and being able to sustain a career in the industry um I like to say they don't see me come in [laughter]\nI'm not originally going to be an actress of what I understand\nIndustry um I like to say they don't see me come in [laughter]\nI'm not originally going to be an actress of what I understand they were going into law I\nI was I was working at\nI went to school for criminal justice graduated uh\nFrom Westchester university right outside of Philly right and turn it the da's office in homicide unit I worked in law firms that the law was what I wanted to do until I you know started and turning and\nWorking at the law firms and seeing that it was just not for me and then I had to really go for my dream and go for this far fetched dream that I had always dreamed about 'em but didn't really know how to make it come true right didn't really have people in the industry around me no one in my family was in the industry and it was just something that I decided to um\nStart doing in Philly and I went on an audition while I was working at the law firm and they fired me because I wasn't supposed to go\nBut little me went anyway [laughter]\n\nI went anyway and I got back to work the next day can log on to my computer they were like yeah we need to think human resources they fired me than my life because from that day on I started to travel to New York and you know take advantage of all the opportunities that there was in Philly and here I Am today\nIt's amazing thing I ask what that first audition was for\nIt was for a foreman mills it was like for you know the store in Philly yes we're print informing males and I ended up looking and I was in like all the former ... windows and you couldn't tell me that I made it at that point\nYou know each each each opportunity or gives you confidence east it's time you book as an actor model or just an artist in general whatever that is um\nWhen you book a job and you see that things are happening and it gives you the confidence to keep going so for me I was like well this seems to be working for me so from there I went to New York and I booked a soap opera um which ended up getting cancer and then I moved to LA I just try to you know make things happen locally before I um made the move to LA\nYou know I I Believe a training grounds there starts at home you're so right now is so funny\nYou mentioned that it sounds very similar to my experience it a lot of the other crew members experiences as well as we literally started in our backyard and music videos here yeah Atlanta yeah and when the industry started knocking on the door yeah bad experience\nAs well prepares you exact all the opportunities that I took advantage of from the acting classes to the print jobs to um the small I think he is and gigs and small commercials that I did in Philly it all prepared me to go to New York in the New York prepared me for\nYeah from the acting classes to the print jobs to um the small I think he is and gigs and small commercials that I did in Philly it all prepared me to go to New York and then you're prepared me for LA so it's about the journey is if it's a journey it's a marathon and we have to uh enjoy the process and I think the process starts out\nAll right so speaking of the process starting at home I Want to kind of go into your character yeah right um [noise] she is somebody who\nIs really similar to your own story she was starting out ... med school and you know the oldest sibling and\nThat sort of thing and then all of a sudden she has this tower area that moms out and she finds that those powers and those gifts that she had inside she said I'm going to put these two very good you are right at the fast and I\nDon't know what was going on with no you know what sometimes you are blessed with the script and you are blessed with an opportunity\nTo audition for someone I'm at for character or where where the parallels are very obvious and they are you know a connection\nUm but it's funny because you know when I think about the first season of black lightning and is this it is and you see thunder developing who\nShe is and grown into the woman and grown into the superhero that she is in the same you know same for myself you know the the the the growth and the journey of a following your dreams and developing into who you know you are and what your full potential is there definitely are a lot of parallels and no they they they didn't know all of this before they have\nThat kind of degrade yeah right um so obviously\nYour character is the first black lesbian\nSuperhero care I mean it's it's one qualifier during after saying I mean I find that people that take on roles that are first\nThey tend to have a little bit of nerves about them yeah you're saying I Hope I don't mess up or I Hope I represent and the way that I feel I'm is necessary uh did you feel like you had that pressure on you when you took this world\nWhere you started reading on script and he said oh my gosh are did any of those feelings come to you\nKnow what I mean it was a little nervous energy because I've never played a lesbian before I've been opposite of all men but and you know I just wanted to make sure that are bringing the foundation of love and not even to\nI mean it was a little nervous energy because I've never played a lesbian before I've been opposite of all men but and you know I just wanted to make sure that are bringing the foundation of love and not even to play on the idea that it's a woman you know is is a relationship and that the foundation it loved there and it's no different than being opposite of men on screen so\nI Would have to say that it was it was like oh I must play listening I'm never done it before but uh\nThere was no reservation or nerves about playing one I I mean playing a superhero upbringing that suggested I was like you know we all have a bit of a super hero inside of us and it's about just tapping into what that is and walking boldly in it\nUm but yeah I didn't feel the pressure to like bring the role justice or anything I just said you know here's a character here's our truth in in and bring as much as myself as possible and my true than who I Am to the character\nAnd that I Will be fine and again ah just\nIn any relationship the foundation is love so as long as that was at the root of you know these characters than I'd be fine and the writers ... kill and you know they obviously are the executive
