Jamie center right here\nSure I think that\nMy most resident memory of pride has to be my first pride which was in two thousand and one I was in the middle of a a fairly difficult coming out process and had moved from a small town in Georgia to Atlanta in June right before pride and I had really never known a community of out\nClear people and certainly didn't know that there was this vibrant thriving happy community it I could be a part of and it really it changed my life and a lot of ways because I realized that\nA lot of the narratives that I had grown up with didn't have to be true and that I could have a really amazing life as an out a person and you say I did I've never left right and how about you dusty what's your memory\nYeah I think is the first time it pride there's something just incredibly special about that moment for me I think it was Nineteen or Twenty years old a living at home and going to college and still sneaking a way to be with the boy for nobody knew I had and\nI went to Long Beach brought I grew up in Southern California and being able to hold his hand and walk around in that space for the first time\nDoing completely safe for who I was feeling really proud about who I was a was\nHonestly life changing and and truly made me want to continue you know when you're still in their closet is a hard thing to go through and for me pride was a step towards starting to live\nTo those were the pride parade about life in Atlanta and savannah respect as like how difference to where you grow up for you Jamie\n[noise] Atlanta very different I grew up in Rome, Georgia and land is very different in a lot of ways from Rome um I didn't experience a lot of\nReally visible or homophobia growing up but there were also not any out where people that I knew there were subjects from you know the church and other just just society and in Atlanta I think that's still exists quite a bit\nAbout where people that I knew there were subjects from you know the church and other just just society and in Atlanta I think that's still exists quite a bit in certain circles but we do have a safe havens and spaces together and pockets of you know a\nReally vibrant algae to life we have bars in space as together and that doesn't really exist in most small towns in Georgia\nThat and you moved to as you said to Atlanta and the early to thousands of these larger pride celebrations like those in Atlanta and savannah mean for folks who don't have celebrations in our small towns\nWell for a lot of people who come to Atlanta Pride a there from small towns so inland pride is a destination for a lot of people we're the largest pride in the cars in the south and about a third of our people come from out of state and about\nI'm a third of people come from Georgia but not Atlanta so you get a lot of people who are experiencing a space that they don't get year round this is the one weekend of the year where they can come and they can be out and they can meet people like them they can\nYou buy a lesbian the T shirt [laughter] you know it doesn't exist in their home town and so you know it's it's really a a destination for a lot of people and it can be really it can be really happy and exciting it can also be really emotional because people\nCan sometimes realize what they're missing or the difference can just be so stark but you know we I think that we experienced the whole gamut of emotions during your pride weekend most of us\nOn pride has certainly expanded I mean major cities like San Francisco New York then celebrating for a long time smaller cities Montgomery Tuscaloosa\nI noticed that in this year a number of really small cities in the Bible belt Auburn open like a\nAh Winchester, Virginia stark Phil Mississippi that shift to me and for pride it does say I'm going to ask you just because you're in a small city but you know a little you're surrounded by a lot more rural area\nWell I mean we're both a smallish city a hundred and forty thousand people or so so uh you know we're certainly better than a lot of those towns or rural Georgia but I'm just\nYou know I think it's been really interesting to watch your right there's so many new prides and with mixture being the fiftieth anniversary of stone wall a woman credible thing to see who sort of ... and reimagining of prides and ah your for for us as a smaller pride\nWall or what an incredible thing to see the sort of rebirth and reimagining of pride and for for us as a smaller pride and I know for a lot of pride it's this process of\nFiguring out what pride means for our community and um do as we're game are hitting the fiftieth anniversary point and knowing how much left there is to accomplish the rebirth of activism and pride has a really fascinating and wonderful thing to say\nLike Amy mentioned a lot of people from out of town for you in Savannah how many people do you estimate her from out of town\n[noise] we have a almost fifty percent of our attendees are from out of town and it's really interesting you know land to a gym you're saying gets so many folks will come in from\nA smaller cities looking for the big city gay experience we actually get a lot of travelers from Chicago and New York in Atlanta and bigger markets\nThat are looking to experience maybe not the really small pride but what a sort of more quaint um smaller pride experience is like um we are very\n\nIf you recently supported G.

me if I Would be interested in starting an oral history project um\nThe idea around it was a bit different um and so I shifted a bit and made it kind of Atlanta replace based um projects with ... activists\nHow far back does it go oh it goes back so it's been in the works for about three years now um but I mean in terms of dates like how far back do you go in the history oh so I I\nStories I'm from as early as\nA around Seventy and and the seventies um\nAs far as uh queer stories about Atlanta but of course all histories go back further because I'm the participants are kind of telling their life stories and they're talking about you know when they they first discovered who they they were they talk about coming out they talk about their family histories or histories and the south\nWhen we're in the region here in the research they still so we're not an authorized to play any audio but I'm Wondering if any stories come to mind that illustrate what drew el GDP cue people of color to Atlanta yeah absolutely\nWell I actually have a story I'm about I'm a woman who's actually from Atlanta I'm so\nA she's kind of remain here and remained a mom prominent activists and the community um but she told me this story about a a club on ... bridge caught numbers and the seventies said she uh she heard about and really wanted to visit a in the beginning she thought she was bisexual and started to\nThey want it to kind of explore sexuality would go to numbers um you know every weekend\nGet out of the car walk up to the door sweating profusely star to shake go back to the van and you

she's like yeah and so she\nGot up and left sister in law got up and left a she ended up I'm staying for a while and dancing with a woman in the club they ended up going into her van and said that points to seek and proclaimed an oral history I found out at that point that I was not by sexual [laughter]\nSo I'm\nJust all these kinds of stories of becoming all of these stories of I'm kind of finding oneself finding one sexuality I'm outside a lot of stories around clubs around these sites I remember in ways that I worry if those were places where al ... in the sights of community yeah\nDuncan for you you moved to Atlanta in the eighties where where did you come come from\nKansas City Missouri so what brought you here um I was coming here to celebrate my refund graduation from college and um my dear friend and cook them home and he sent for me\nAnd he offered me a two free week vacation but he also hurt a fly on her mind and so in two weeks that are arrived it was the perfect two weeks for me but calm\nSo the son of a second week was a Labor Day weekend\nWhich is now considered black pride but back then it was just Labor Day you're going to Atlanta\nBut a whole lot of um African American I'm gay and lesbian folks will come in town and so um\n[noise] but Sunday I was at a picnic on remake Terry backyard and I thought it was just going to be a regular picnic and when I arrived there were more than two hundred man and his backyard partying and there was some of the best looking [noise] um most um\nYou know urban and um or or brain I'm\nLooking in and they were all dressed to the nine ... we were having a\nOne day you at in Kansas City anymore in Kansas\nCity any more I thought that every blood to a person in America was in the backyard you started work

celebrating [noise]\nStill had has changed obviously so much in the in the community assay what are the kinds of stories and things that you were hearing from that time that make you think about that transformation and how important it was\nUm well I remember I'm having a conversation with Duncan actually after um we did his or history and we were talking specifically about I'm a black gay club on kind of the west side of Atlanta and talking about what it meant for black\nGay folks and that era to be in the club and and I remember him saying to me which is this still resonates with me he said we were dancing for our lives\nParticularly because um you didn't know who was going to be there the next week right you know companies are being decimated and I'm\nStill ... there's a moment particularly when um you you gather\nYou've dined together you eat together you share stories they're these particular moments of kind of activity that that really um [noise] that that demonstrate the power of what it means to be black queer and in Atlanta\nAnd community I mean I'm thinking that the experience for the race obviously adds a real dimension to these stories especially in the south to
