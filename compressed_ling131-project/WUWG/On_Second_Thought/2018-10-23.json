first African American woman admitted to UGA was Charlayne Hunter Gault in Nineteen sixty one\nShe inspired Mary Frances early to attend a year later\nEarly was the first black UGA graduate with a masters in music education and she joins me now to discuss her legacy at the university Mary welcome\nThank you very much it's good to be here will so glad to have you here you attended high school in Atlanta in the Nineteen fifties you were in the school band and nurtured your love of music what was it like there in high school\nWell with the same high school then showing and Hamilton attendance although I was five years ahead of them and I need to say that actually I went to University of Georgia the same year that Charlene in Hamilton when in sixty one guy not a year later\nWell I'm Glad you correct me thank you very much a like a good teacher and you became a music education for many years later but when you were growing up you grow up in segregated Atlanta what was your exposure to music then because it was symphonic music he left\nWants to them phonics and we couldn't go to the symphony because it's\nWe're up in segregated Atlanta what was your exposure to music then because it was symphonic music he left\nIt was a symphonic and we couldn't go to the symphony because everything was was segregated by what my dad did was he had to sit around on Sunday evenings together as a family and listen to the bell telephone our\nAnd they played like classical music they played opera and Broadway music and I learned to love music and wanted to actually have started piano as a result of that\nAnd before you applied to UGA for graduate school you're working as a music teacher in Michigan\n[noise] no I was going to school there\nWell I Am just getting my facts all wrong\nThat's why I was teaching here in Atlanta and John Hope elementary school\nWhich is on boulevard in the ... ward very close to Dr King's church but I went during the summer you know teachers have to go during the summer to summer school and I went to the University of Michigan uh two summers before I entered the University of Georgia\nWhy did you decide to go to University of Georgia\nI saw a riot on television little black and white TV showing Charlene in Hamilton being\nEscorted back to Atlanta so it's been dead for their own safety and I said they can't do that I wanted to do something to help with the civil rights that was going on on the marches and I knew I couldn't do the picketing and sit ins because I was\nI was employed by the state and I would have been fired but I thought I can go to school so I decided I told my mom that night I'm going to transfer to the University of Georgia from Michigan\nWell so that was a really quick decision and before you applied you a a you had to go through getting him it was a pretty lengthy process let's say that way and the difficulty with\nMore and more barrier supposed to discourage you and other African American students from applying what kind of obstacles did you have to overcome just to get that application and\nWell when they got my transcripts um they've found that I was black\nAnd they asked for my high school transcript which is very unusual because I had gone to college and finished I was in uh the master's program at the University of Michigan and what they didn't know was that actually my high school transcript was even better than my college and um then I had to go\nAnd when they didn't know was that actually my high school transcript was even better than my college and um then I had to go to the courthouse to get\nA signature from the the judge saying that I was an upstanding citizen I don't know how he was supposed to know\nAnd actually the clerk of caught find that and then there was a an investigative report that was done that actually I didn't know about until the year two thousand but they investigate in my background if I had a near you'll disease if I had shop lifted than a rats that uh if I had an illegitimate child ...\nThoughts um they they tried to find some way of disqualifying me but I was on the paragon of virtue are but I certainly wasn't doing any of those things\nAnd then there was a an interview on on campus and at that interview with the registry which was a required supposedly I was asked about living in a house for prostitution\nAnd that just really destroyed me in Woodley but I knew that he was trying to build me into disrespecting I'll sing disrespectful things that I I wouldn't rise to that challenge I kept my cool but I was really very angry\nSomewhat just taught you what prepared you for that keeping your cool being ... grace under pressure from what I found that\nMy parents they were my role models and\nAlthough we grew up in a segregated society they did not teach me to disrespect people because of their race or to blame them they just told us that you know you have to have character you have to get education that is the world to progress\nAnd you can do anything that anyone else can do if you're prepared and I think it was watching them observing them learning from them but I was able to do it\nWell despite ... jumping through all of those who do you did you worried and they did when you finally got to campus do you remember that first day what it was black [noise]\nYes I Do I had a white student in art students was graduate um she lives in the graduate program who met me at a local dentist office and we went to registration together um when we walked up to the registration line\nA very noisy and when we approached but everyone turned around and looked enough and it was very it was quite I didn't know what to expect\nWhen we approached but every one turned around and looked at us and it was very it was quite I didn't know what to expect and I think can I not been with the white students it might have gone much worse\nBut that was a very scary moment\nRight because you had seen images on television of riots a Charlayne and Hamilton deem new planted a pretty much chased out so be prepared for the worst\nI was in fact I was assigned to that same room that Charlene had been in right on the street vulnerable to bomb too rough to whatever what happened to her\nWell she was at the time when I went in the summer of sixty one she had gone to the political times I Believe as an intern and Hamilton had gone home and I think he was working as a lifeguard so that was the lone black on campus except for people and menial positions\nSo Hamilton homes I don't know if we've said his last name yet a Charlayne Hunter Gault in Hamilton homes to other African Americans were admitted to UGA before you you I'll ever were a masters student you are a had been to Spelman if I got no Clark sorry [noise]\nThis is a huge challenge and I know that other people that we've spoken to um women who integrated grammar schools or some uh lower schools have talked about the incredible loneliness of that experience what did it feel like for you\nIt was very lonely at the University of Michigan you know I could walk and talk with classmates white black it didn't matter and it was a very liberal campus\nWhen I went to Georgia
