... census\nRather dramatically and this has really been a an initiative of ours in recent years a led by the museum's director rams Suffolk since his arrival in fall of of twenty Fifteen\nUm to redirect the museums attention and resources um two are representing the diversity that is uh Atlanta that is a more states\nAnd um there have been great strides in in that regard and uh in terms of a A R audience and who is coming to the museum\nAnd reflecting um uh people of color certainly a that correspond to the demographics of the city of Atlanta I'm even more so whereas before the high was perhaps how to an audience of somewhere around Fifteen Percent\nOr people of color visiting a we're now forty five fifty percent which are certainly is much more in line with the word the city of Atlanta is at fifty one percent\nI'm already majority a representation and that's really due to a where we'd have shifted our programming where we have underscored what we have been doing and in previous years in terms of making inroads into the building the collections and exhibitions to represent that greater diversity\nThat find ransacked ... had to ask that museum director speaking to NPR about how they pull that off three times the amount of diverse audience when he started\nOur staff got together and they did a remarkable job of staying you know what you'd our voice be it institutions and they came back and say generous other institution we're very proud of that there should be more southern hospitality in terms of the way we engage with people\nPerhaps the more humility about the way we're talking about ourselves than with individuals that are out there and ultimately we came up with the tagline called here for you\nThat we just want to put it out there that

thousand five and what the museum has been doing in terms of the the territorial program\nHas been one to really show leadership hum in acquiring those uh works um by artists of color acquiring works um by a artist of a different genders\nAnd having a ... a greater representation there so that it it was in in many ways long overdue and what we had to do in terms of our task was reflect that in the re installation\nAnd uh where the collections were and what we're presenting was a you know where the museum was in the past and\nSo along with everything else that the museum has been doing per dramatically this was a logical next step for us to take 'em no it was very much a multi year efforts and a multi pronged effort in terms of\nIt's not simply one department doing something but it was a complete re installation of the building from top to bottom\nAnd an example of how it would look well one of the things I'm I'm I'm especially proud of is what we were able to do by changing the physical location certain collections and also changing the intellectual exchange between those collections\nAnd I think it's perhaps most evident if you go to\n... is our top floor skyway level of the a stent wing which is a Richard Myers building and the wheel and ... which is one of the rings of piano pavilions and you see uh the immediate relationship between aspects of modern and contemporary collection and our folk and self taught collections and are African art collections\nAnd I think this is borne out of a realization that we we talked about not only how do we give 'em crater prominence two aspects were collection which are quite important\nUh certainly uh all three of those collections as as well as others they have important key works um that are unique to the high uh that uh visitors here in Atlanta or visitors coming to Atlanta would want to see but um there there were works of contemporary art or their works of modern art and they all are regardless of\nWhether they were made in Africa or whether they were made in Georgia or whether they were made in anywhere in the world\nAnd I think it was important for us to underscore that relationship and uh certainly this is something that some of her sister institutions have been doing and I think\nAnd I think it was important for us to underscore that relationship and I'm certainly this is something

I spoke with her when the book first came out and asked her what she find so intriguing about the state she now calls home I Am\nSo ambivalent about Florida so I both absolutely adore it I go for a run every single morning outs and the prairie and I see the natural world and I can you know they're always snakes ... foot and amazing birds that I Wish that I could identify sort of landing in the

and the thing that I was looking at when I was trying to figure out how to put up with this story collection together um\nWas what how do I look at Florida itself um ... what do I think of the ... the name Florida what what does it mean to me in it to me it means\nPervasive ongoing dread\nCovered in sunlight hitting gold and beautiful stunning suddenly so the lord\nA tourist board is not going to make the spokes person well perhaps\nSay well if they want to make Florida even weirder than it is\nYeah the sense of danger underfoot especially in places where humans meet the natural world it's like a snake coiled in the bath tub and an alligator not far from the dog Penn is seeing coal at the edge of the suburb [noise] that feel like that to you that you could just fly into some other realm it does\nFeel like that to me but it also feels like that in terms of being a parent in today's world to small children right I mean if you like\nJust the act of having a child in the world as an act of danger right because suddenly you have the heart taken out of your chest and made manifest in the world and you can't control the world around the your your child so\nUm I Do I Do think that that's the way I feel about the state but it's all the way I feel about you know being a human in this\nCurrent environment um but we happened to be in right now\nWhat's the danger of children is in teams like part of the game here there's a story dogs go wall that's about a pair of younger sisters\nTheir mother all adults abandon them on the island and at first you know it's fun there's a big sister making up stories about princesses that potentially they're eating chap stick to survive\nYou are a parent's you're also the author was that your role with your little sister kind of keeping or going this story did\nCome out of a moment in my life and my sister was having a hard time and I kept thinking how I could protect her I mean\nShe's she's an adult now she's in her mid thirties she's a two time Olympic athlete she's fine she doesn't need me to protect her but it is also something that I've been theme at all\nIn her mid thirties she's a two time Olympic athlete she's fine she doesn't need me to protect her\nBut it is also something that I've been thinking about a lot in about the world in general is um how do we take care of the most vulnerable among us I mean we have to take care of the vulnerable people in our world\nHow do we do so um how do we make sure everybody is a is able to survive how ... how do we do these things so that the defense apparel comes from um a larger almost existential idea or in that story\nWell her answer to vulnerability is fantasy and and I can't help but think of Florida as Disney Princess land it and did you have those kinds of fantasies did you make up those kind of story when you were a kid\nI never liked the princess I've always hated the whole narrative of the prince of the narrative of the princes is it um your life basically ends as soon as you find love made I mean it's almost as though oh woman only exists in order to be an object of love or to to have to have a love story\nWhen in reality I mean I have an older brother and I thought that he wasn't fed these narratives um he was fed the narrative that you go out and you have your adventure and your life has your adventure and I resented the idea that my life and as soon as I fell in love\nSo I um I actually truly dislike a lot of the narratives that we are force fed and we actually take in a with you know our our milk with the media\nUm all around us and I I think one of the things that this question does is that it opposes a lot of these these narratives these narratives about what it means to be a mother and and to to seize that space\nWhat it means to be domestic were domesticated but it means to sort of resist the wild about why all sue tempting the wild and um you know I hate the cowboy Mitt those I hate princesses I you know I hate the things that we are told\n'em that our our our skeletons of our narratives and as we all know narrative is the most important thing if you control the narrative control everything around\nYou're reminding me of an appearance that I saw view from twenty sixteen this is on the Charlie Rose show I'm Charlie Rose we know what has happened to him sense that I just want to play it because that's pointed to something that you're talking about\nHas so much ... and I think that's in myself and I think that's an all out of my friends do you owe one holding your rage\nTrey so much rain and I think that's in myself and I say this and all of my friends\nOne holding your rage\nAnd it's not so much that I was unusual in my age is that women are not necessarily allowed access open access to our our fury on so white stuff yes women are not necessarily open access to their fury straight with\nThe bit of a part of their lord and girls yeah okay I was with the gas [laughter] also he talked about hoping um um but I Would like to say I ... I felt\nGuilty about this interaction the whole time I was playing nice um and I was being a nice guess and I could have just said\nOh women have so much to be angry about I mean when we make\nSeventy five cents on the man's dollar and less for women of color when we have to fight every day for bodily autonomy when we have lack of representatives in politics and business on the Supreme Court I mean everything everything we have everything to be angry about and yet I failed\nI filled all feminists by not saying these things to Charlie Rose\nAnd might not standing up I'm for women at that moment so I feel very ambivalent hearing that clip\nWell you just got to make it up right I did a Charlie Rose audience but being in that position a woman's blaming female rage to Charlie Rose\nWhen you heard about the accusations against him did you have any perspective on the way that he understood or maybe thought about women no\nBecause he was kind to me right he was being very nice he did he did interrupt me you know and uh I think I Am more used to that than a man would be um [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "22"}
