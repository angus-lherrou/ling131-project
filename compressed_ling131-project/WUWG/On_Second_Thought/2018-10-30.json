Prescott\nIn June of twenty Seventeen Rebecca Traister traveled to Georgia to cover Jon Ossoff raised to beat Karen Handel in a runoff election lending among the newly activated women campaigning for us off she writes us like walking onto the set of Thelma and Louise\nLike the awaken heroines of the film they had crossed over\nWhat they meant was getting in touch with their rage in her new book good and bad Traister follow the historic shake up since social movements from abolition to me to to the historic number of women now running for local and national office sparked when women's teary turns into action\nRebecca Traister will be reading at the Decatur library tonight and joins us now with more in her book good and bad Rebecca welcome\nFor having me for junior guy that clip [laughter] bring her wild [laughter] really does that movie is but you know the music and the voices\nThanks for having me for Jimmy a guy that clip brings wild [laughter] really does that movie is but you know the music and the voices it's very evocative\nAnd very very seemingly revolutionary at the time even though it was many years after the quote unquote women's movement\n[laughter] it's so interesting you know I was in high school in that movie came out and I really responded to viscerally and my feelings about it I've watched it several times in the years since [laughter]\nAnd you know there was a moment where I watched it and I was like well this is not very good and then I watched it again a few years ago and it was like oh it's incredibly powerful but at the time and I actually talked to somebody about this in the in this book I write about how a woman who slightly older than I Am Laura Miller I'm a book critic at slate\nI'm told me about how uncomfortable that movie made men in ways that I think are a very related to the\nWay that a contemporary politicization is making some men uncomfortable at this point I'm you know women's lives being changed as they become\nCivically engaged and I'm participants in a protest and electoral life that perhaps some of them hadn't been before my my former colleague Laura Miller said to me remembering 'em Thelma and Louise release um when she was as a few years older than me you know a young woman\nShe said the men around her hated it they were so scared of it they hated that movie made them feel so threatened and so uncomfortable you know and she was talking about a specific scene but you know that's something that I write about a little bit in the book that\nWhen women are a week into anger and begin expressing it and listening to anger in from the women around them um and working with the women around them it can be so just competing for the men\nWant that's the thing in Roswell in Cobb County stays are traditionally Republican suburban districts you write about women's anger becoming audible to each other and people weren't necessarily accustomed to political activism and and even said I don't know how to protest here's one of them Gen Cox\nI was afraid that it would affect\nEven perhaps my kids' relationships with their friends um we're all making a lot of assumptions that that terrible things would happen if we came out as liberals came\nOut as liberal and out of the closet and it has a realm as you point out many times in the book is something that many women of color grew up with or are used to\nWell it's so complicated and the roots are very deep one of the things that\nIt's in the book is something that many women of color grew up with or are used to [noise]\nWell it's so complicated and the roots are very deep one of the things that we have to reckon with and that that I I'm trying to reckon with myself and ask readers to reckon with via this book [noise]\nUm are the ways in which the ways in which white patriarchy his work throughout this country's history and one of the ways that it works is that\nUm you know you have a white patriarchy which is fundamentally a kind of minority rule right in which white men are offered all kinds of power political power economic power social and sexual power and there are a minority part of the population and yet they have a tighter grip on power than the majority has\nAnd how in a democracy does a minority power hold on when theoretically the members of that majority joined together and voted out you know or overthrow it or alter the power structure one part of the way you do that is by offering incentives to members of that subjugated or underrepresented majority\nThere are a lot of incentives to not be the troublemaker right and that's what a lot of white women who have been Democrats for a long time and it was in ... counties in in Georgia six that I first really began to hear this story and it was very\nMoving to me ... white suburban women who had long\nProgressive democratic ideas but hadn't when Gen Cox was just describing hadn't wanted to rock the boat they hadn't wanted to be those just competing forces right they hadn't wanted to make\nTheir communities feel like they were troublemakers or challengers or unpleasant they didn't want to even put out a yard sign 'em and that's one of the things that happens within white patriarchy where there is a reward kind of offered\nTo white women who don't rock the boat which is you'll be accepted in our community in our society we won't label us you know a troublemaker now those rewards have never been offered to women of color right they get neither\nThe the rewards or the power offered by white supremacy nor the rewards are power offered by patriarchy and Brittany Cooper who's really she's a she's a scholar and the author of another book about women's anger eloquent rage that is just so incandescent Lee good she has taught me about\nHow the fact that women of color and black women have never been offered any kind of incentive to support white patriarchy\nHas in fact permitted them to be the thought leaders the intellectual and organizing ground breakers of so many progressive movements\nThat have wound up transforming this nation but for white women who are there are so many incentives offered to not be dismissed\nBreakers of so many progressive movements that have wound up transforming this nation but for white women who are there are so many incentives offered to not be disruptive\nFor the moment at which the anger becomes so intense that bubbles over over which is of course what happened\nUm for a lot of women in Georgia six than all over the country in the wake of the twenty sixteen election and this isn't new entrance into a progressive political coalition and as John Cox and and many others have said it is a kind of language a personal transformation of coming out of revealing one's true self\nAnd when you reveal that self which is in part angry at inequality at unfairness that injustice\nEars finding people who may have been living on your block this whole time also trying not to be the disruptive forces in the community but it turns out that you were frustrated about the same things for very long and ... for a long time but now that you can hear each other and see each other\nAnd begin to work together what you can do is organized one of the things that you introduced was the idea that there's a concerted attempt can really shut women's anger down because it is considered disruptive to the social order because it is corrosive and looking at some of the words that are used to describe women's anger in the book\n\nElection night stay with NPR News I'm Ari

V. D. I'm Virginia Prescott\nOn my conversation with Rebecca Traister continues her new book is called good and mad and explores what she calls the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThis message that of course angering unattractive women but suppressing it there are several spiritual traditions you know the Christian tradition to Buddhist tradition\nAfter reading the book I went back to re watch Hillary Clinton during the ... and found the headline\nYou know Hillary Clinton shows yoga poise during van ... is the is there a kind of\nMoral superiority or here in suppressing anger Oh yes we're congratulated for suppressing our anger right and left ... literally politically right and politically laugh I'm Barbara leave the remarkable congresswoman from California\nI'm tells a story in the book\nOf how for years she was the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force in two thousand one after September eleventh and for sixteen years afterwards she has she has works to repeal that authorization for the use of military force which permits government to go\nTo engage military action without Congress's approval and she's been working at it working out at working at it in the summer of twenty Seventeen she actually finally passed\nThe repeal with bipartisan support it was like the only functional thing that happened and\nCongress's approval and she's been were had it working out at working at it in the summer of twenty Seventeen she actually finally passed\nThe repeal with bipartisan support it was like the only functional thing that happened in the government during twenty Seventeen and the federal government and and Paul Ryan stripped the repeal from the bill that it was in an overnight and the middle of an overnight and the middle of the night and she was she had\nEvery reason in the world to be livid about this and she had to appear in front of one of her colleagues to make the argument about why this happened this should not have happened and she tells the story in the book really movingly about how\nHer internal machinations to not show her anger to not raise her voice and she said I knew if I showed my anger\nIt would undermine my point I'd get written off as the angry black woman um they wouldn't hear what I had to say I wouldn't be taken seriously it would hurt me to show the anger that I you know she had every right to feel\nAnd so she describes that process which is will be familiar to a lot of people from a lot of angles and then afterwards she talks about how many of her friends her weight friends peers compatriots congratulated her on holding it together and how angry that made her because she said you don't even know you don't even know the work I had to do as a black woman\nTo hold that anger and and and how how unfair it is that I wasn't allowed to express the anger that I had every reason to feel\nBarbara Lee story is so instructive about how one has to perform this calculation inside of the head in order to figure out how bad can I be\nBut there's going to be a difference between the the power bases and the needs and the concerns of those women standing shoulder to shoulder right how did they here and not others anger issues are so different\nIssues are so vast so diverse and they always have been and the challenge in front of progressive coalitions is not to paper over the differences and in fact the Internet scene angers the anger and inequities within progressive coalitions\nYou know and this is something that Audrey lord has been was arguing in the early eighties I'm In her you know crucial essay the uses of anger where she writes about\nThe anger over racism between white and black feminist and she argues that the expression of that anger and the ... and the the act of listening to the anger\nI'm a black women about racism within the women's movement it's crucial to the forward motion of the women's movement that anger expressed between women can be generated can take us to the next place and the idea of suppressing it further even between would be allies is ... is what's damaging within the ... progressive coalitions as well and so\nThe next place and that the idea of suppressing it further even between would be allies is is what's damaging within the ... progress and coalitions as well and so part of the challenge moving forward is to listen for the anger of\nThose who share our frustrations listen to their anger about lots of things including if some of that anger is that us there ... your silence won't protect you\nAnd actually you write in a book about the period in which you're writing this book which is really concentrated period of time in your life has one of the healthiest the cause of your anger because you're contacting that anger what does that done for you personally [laughter]\nWell I think it's not even about contacting the anger it's about the fact that I was in this very unusual position which is I was writing a book about anger which meant that I was literally being paid it was my job every day for a period of four months which is as when I drafted this book to be\nAngry every day and to take the anger of other women seriously to take the history of women's anger seriously to take my own anger seriously and so mostly it was this like\nExtremely privileged\nExperience of living in like an anger ... where nobody was telling me it was invalid quite the contrary no one was telling me it made me sound crazy quite the contrary and\nI was just getting to express my anger every day as if it were you know part of a normal range of human reaction to inequality which I Believe it is but that's such a rare experience um and one afforded by my very unusual position\nAnd I was healthy during those four months I realized at the beginning of the book and I started to drafted in my introduction I'd written of course anger can be bad for you because that's what I understood right we all understand who wants to be angry all the time it's bad for you\nAt the end of this for months when I went back and looked at that part of the introduction I was like you know what I have never\nFelt better than I have these four months I slept really well I wanted to exercise without being on any kind of exercise regimen I ate better without being on any kind of dietary regiment I had good sex my relationships with members of my family were strong and communicative\nIt was a wonderful period of like I felt like a full human and I realized in retrospect oh maybe that's because\nI was able to express anger with the feeling that it was going to be taken seriously in the world and be able to express it to write it down to have it not marginalized or laughed out or turned into something monstrous then it's it's as you said it doesn't have to define you I sometimes think that in swallowing our anger\nA marginalized or laughed out or turned into something monstrous\nThen it's it's as you said it that it doesn't have to define you I sometimes think that in swallowing our anger we make it means\nSo much more to us so that it comes to defining us even more when if you can just be part of how we express ourselves everyday alongside our joy in our fear and our contentment and our exhaustion\nIt wouldn't looms so large and in fact could just be one of the many human impulses and reasonable responses that guide us toward action than engagement in the world ...
