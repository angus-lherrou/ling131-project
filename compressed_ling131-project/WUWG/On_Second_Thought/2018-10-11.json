but the idea that the solution to racial justice of the ...\nCritical thinking about the United states or his family left the south moved to New York and he rankled that the idea that the solution to racial injustice in America was to assimilate African Americans into mainstream white society this was the holding and brown versus board of education in Nineteen fifty four\nAnd Bob and said wait a minute why should we want to assimilate into white society maybe whites could learn from our history and our traditions white America's a burning house\nOther African American writers that Ralph Ellison Zora Neil Hurston you quote on the book and write about them and detail intellectuals and leaders argued that forced integration\nInspired art my gas and blues and created resilience and separate Folkways among African Americans was that an argument for Jim Crow\nIt was so uh as early as Eighteen nineties news south boosters like Henry ... here in Georgia Charles Bradley Koch in North Carolina\nArgued and this was the aspirational case for segregation\nShare it also included this franchise has been and discrimination but a lot of progressive said this system of separating the races as going to create a diverse society African Americans and why it's will create their own institutions their own traditions their own schools even though and art\nAnd this will enable us to live in harmony to work closely side by side but also to preserve our separate identities\nTill ... mansion argued that African Americans they didn't need to be absorbed into Anglo saxon culture and could develop their own with an idea of just by cultural parallel societies living side by side\nIt was and it was a right hand turn away from what had been going on in the south before the civil war\nBefore the civil war they aspirational case for the legal system of slavery\nHad been we're assimilating people from other backgrounds that are non Christian into Christian Anglo saxon white society we're helping slaves were carrying for them and there was this humanitarian project as southern proponents of slavery explained it after the war a new\nTheory comes up and that is we don't want assimilation we want separate development we want to create separate traditions separates institutions and a separate society and that will actually minimize violence rather than increase that\nThey have an argument made by Robert Penn Warren that the cultural strength that the south\nAnd a separate society and that will actually minimize violence rather than increase that\nTime they have an argument made by Robert Penn Warren that the cultural strength of the south with proof\nThat it needed to reform the Jim Crow system as a policy of this now wholesale revolution off at that this was all thrown man who have gathered negro folk songs and tails and and appreciated black Folkways and thought they needed to be protected\nPaternal isn't like this idea the happy negroes working on the plantation\nSure so this whole story can fit into a larger literature on the south and it can be viewed as a form of paternal as much as we are going to treat different people differently because we know best now Warren turned to African American folklore and wrote an essay Nineteen twenty nine called the briar patch\nWhere he said African Americans in the south or like prayer rabbit and then the folklore are the folks story ... rabbit is captured by a Fox who and warns telling our whites and he says the Fox whatever you do don't throw me into the briar patch the briar patch appears to be hostile and dangerous it's full of thorns\nAnd the Fox does okay that's exactly what I'm going to do he throws rapid into the bar patch and very rapid escapes why he'd grown up in the briar patch and still warring sides as a\nBlack space and here's the irony we've come full circle so the platform the movement for black lives matter black lives matter China has the coats who risks on James Baldwin and the burning house\nTells a similar story which is we don't necessarily want integration there's almost no mention of immigration and the movement for black lives it's about black institutions black traditions and black history or black narrative what this country is about\nAnd so yes there's a faster to this that it's paternal us but then there's another facet to it that's almost nationalist in a way and so\nIt cuts and a lot of different directions\nAnd Robert Penn Warren with also part of this group called death here today and they were kind of thing was themselves from northern or it's from deep math industrial culture that within overtaking the north\nSo how much of that idea of bi cultural institution it's also resistance to northern arms or to the government telling them what to do as happened with brown versus board of education [noise]\nWell that's what's interesting about the civil war so the civil war leaves southerners white southerners in particular where they real distaste for federal government a real distaste for the idea of centralized\nOf the civil war said the civil war leaves southerners white southerners in particular where they just taste for federal government a real distaste for the idea of centralized control and so\nA type of conservatism emerges and as conservatives was anti government and this is what Lewis Powell the Supreme Court justice talks about regents for ... which is I desegregated landscape where America is the land of ... institutions plural views and\nThat's important and we have to retain that because otherwise we're all going to be doing what the government tells us to do and they're responding to what the union army did during the civil war to reconstruction and there's an African American

information but for now we returned to my guest Anders Walker author or the burning house Jim Crow and the making of modern America\nBefore the break we talked about the Gulf between concepts of pluralism and coexistence championed by white southern writers like Robert Penn Warren\nAnd wanted to protect their once dominant culture and black intellectuals like James Baldwin and Zora Neil Hurston who thought a level of separatist them that would protect a culture that had been violently suppressed\nThese pluralistic ideas or cultural and eventually became legal framework\nThat get back to Andrew Walker\nAnd then how does this idea of preserving culturally identities figure into the current debate over Confederate monuments for example the idea that\nMany of them as we know were built in during the civil rights movement in opposition to the civil rights movement as symbols of cultural heritage yet a lot of people contemporary southerners hold on to them as symbols of their cultural heritage\nWells that have sensors in rubber they leave I think we have such as in my book and I think that aspect of southern history as something that the south can double down on and I think that's something we should commemorate and I think Confederate statues if they're contextualize correctly\nHistory as something that the south can double down on and I think that's something we should commemorate and\nI think Confederate statues if they're contextualize correctly\nAre important historical markers precisely because they emerged much later than the civil war Nineteen tens Nineteen twenties and in a weird way if you think about it to commemorate civil war leaders in the Nineteen twenties wasn't middle finger not just it's civil rights activists to but at the federal government so\nI think that we said we should rethink southern history and I think this tradition of diversity of something positive I think we should abandon the idea and actually reject the idea that the south had anything to do with the kind of ethnic nationalism there was going on in Europe\nHow that ended pluralism and multiculturalism become I hated reading northern liberals I mean even cosmopolitan is similar to the case in among the north ... from what is that men for the division of northern and southern culture\nSo the way most people think of multiculturalism and diversity is that these are ways to achieve integration these are ways to kind of achieve a plural society\nAnd that tradition\nAs far as I can tell really comes from other places Canada's one so candidate began to develop a discourse of multiculturalism to deal with the French threat of secession and so candidate began to talk about a different kind of society ... society there was also about quality\nNow the one thing that Lewis a foul junior does not do is talk about equality and in a string of opinions he rarely shuts the door on things like affirmative action reparations aggressive measures to achieve racial balance in schools\nHe strikes down bussing across school district lines and in that sense that say southern legacy which has yes on diversity but no on government programs to achieve equality\nAnd that we could say the negative but the thing is power writes the big opinion so he is really the source\nAnd it this is a ... trait that a lot of people don't know that no matter where you live and learn about the civil rights movement or at least can sound the broad outlines and the idea that America is supposed to be integrated and simulate all\nKinds of that have you had any backlash from presenting the whole point of view and his book\nWell I I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century and in fact people have been open to my artist\nBack to some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century and in fact people have been opened in my argument and I think it's because\nMillennials younger Americans are over the moment where we believed full assimilation into mainstream white society was the way to go and I think now all times not just due to black lives matter the movement for black lives but the Trump presidency\nThis is a low point for white folks in this country the Trump presidency is confirming many of the fears of many people had\nThat white people in America are native is their anti immigrant they're fearful of integration their feel fearful new ideas and if you look at the contrast between the Obama presidency and the Trump presidency the Obama presidency seems to be more aspirational more laudable and forward looking and less riddled with fear and\nParanoia and in a weird way I think folks like kind of has the coats have responded to this and said why'd America's burning house we need to think more carefully about whether we want to integrate into it\nThat idea that an American culture is being folly Dubai or get looted by outsiders by immigrants from email from Eastern Europe from Mexico from Central America is\nPrevailing that's movement that is pro holding on to whining sat there and traditions are American tradition that bumped up against what you're talking about\nIt so I think my book says if you really think about the American south\nDiversity is a core American values and so people like Richard Spencer who allegedly coined this term All right he was one of the organizers of the Charlottesville unite the Right rally he has said publicly diversity is ruining America we need to double down on a European heritage\nWell what happened to Europe and the twentieth century it committed suicide twice first in World War one then in World War two over what European heritage ethnic nationalism area and supremacy\nWent to the United states to develop segregation and what happened Martin Luther king junior emerges after World War two along with a Philip Randolph and other folks saying America's about equality diversity\nIncludes an opportunity and the whole world gets on board with this and so that aspect of this story I think is what we should recover precisely now and people are saying oh diversity is not an American value oh it is an American value and if you want to celebrate Robert relief that the value to celebrate\nTaint university law professor and just walk I thank you so much for speaking with us thank you and isn't it\nAnd if you want to celebrate Robert relief that's the value to

Henry Grady mansion argued that African Americans they didn't need to be absorbed into Anglo saxon culture and could develop their own with an idea of just by cultural parallel system\nAnd they didn't need to be absorbed into Anglo saxon culture and could develop their own with an idea of just by cultural parallel societies living side by side\nIt was and it was a right hand turn away from what had been going on in the south before the civil war before the civil war they aspirational case for the legal system of slavery\nHe pointed at ... among others have talked about the need for racially upon and they say you know for safety and for liberation\nAnd these were early twentieth century intellectuals or mid ... century intellectuals writing at a time like hip hop or Michael Jordan are Colin Powell were virtually I imagine that ball\nSo why did they re examination at that time tell us today\nBut I think it\nUs to tell a different story about American history\nAnd a lot of ways the south saves America and the Nineteen twenties the United states was going down to very dark road we were trying to create to support an Anglo saxon Protestant society there was this basic view that the American stock was Anglo saxon Protestant northern European\nMax Weber's Protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism convince people that America's the capitalist country was successful precisely because Anglo saxon Protestant said built it we enact strict immigration restrictions to keep out\nImmigrants from southern central Europe menu from a Catholic we enact prohibition to assimilate Catholic immigrants into Protestant society to Costa drinking cultures we support eugenics most states had forced sterilization rules for people who are feeble minded\nSo just as a homes in his famous statement at three generations themselves are enough supports this idea of forced sterilization\nAll of these things were pushing us towards a ... a road where we were embracing genetics immigration restrictions creating a ... a kind of race civilized nation so much so that the Germans started taking notes from us in the Nineteen twenties and thirties uh Adolph Hitler and his ...\nRacialized nation so much so that the Germans started taking notes from us in the Nineteen twenties and thirties uh Adolph Hitler and his men more my struggle to my top talks about the United states as an area nation it had used immigration law to keep\nThe United states northern European it'd removed all indigenous people I Native Americans he then appoints lawyers to study American law\nThey like the mandatory sterilization laws they liked the immigration restrictions they liked bans on interracial marriage but the one thing they reject desegregation ...\nThey say segregation is not going to work for us it's not going to enable us to create an area and state because that'll mean that minorities do as Germans will have their own institutions their own traditions their own society and the undermined what we're trying to do\nIn a way that's what happens African Americans successfully by the end of World War two\nNot only indoor Jim Crow then prevail they emerge some of the most eloquent exponential of American ideals but those ideals mentioned nothing about [noise] Anglo saxon Protestant supremacy their ideals about equality racial justice opportunity democracy\nAnd if we think of America in American history through this lens then the south\nThanks in part to Jim Crow but also to the African American experience really tails and ascendant hopeful story\nMy guest is an just walk on his book the burning house detailed arguments made by black and white intellectual ... twenty century to protect that print cultural traditions and Folkways which for African Americans ... ... now\nFinally got back out those notions of preserving heritage being distorted today [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of every once you listen to cover the rising cost of programs we bring you ... if we didn't hear from you during our fault fund drive there's still time to support the program\nAnd the participation of everyone who listens to cover the rising costs of programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life please take a moment now to make an on line contributions go to ... dot org and click donate at the top of the page\nYour contribution at whatever level is right for you for help cover the cost of the programs you love on cheap ...\nThank you so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting support\nFor CPB comes from you our listeners\nAnd the Atlanta Opera presenting west side story Bernstein's classic Broadway musical of love trying to conquer differences November third six nine and eleven at the Cobb energy center tickets at Atlanta Opera dot O.

I think we should have statues of my book [laughter] and I think that aspect of southern history as something that the south can double down on and I think that's something we should commemorate and I think Confederate statues if they're contextualize correctly\nAre important historical markers precisely because they emerged much later than the civil war Nineteen tens Nineteen twenties and in a weird way if you think about it to commemorate civil war leaders in the Nineteen twenties wasn't middle finger not just that civil rights activists to but at the federal government so\nI think that we said we should rethink southern history and I think this tradition of diversity of something positive I think we should abandon the idea and actually reject the idea that the south had anything to do with the kind of ethnic nationalism there was going on in Europe\nThat ended pluralism and multiculturalism become associated leaving northern liberals I mean even cosmopolitan is and more sophistication among the north ... so what does that meant for the division of northern and southern culture\nSaid the way most people think of multiculturalism and diversity is that these are ways to achieve integration these are ways to kind of achieve a plural society\nAnd that tradition\nAs far as I can tell really comes from other places Canada's was so candidate began to develop a discourse of multiculturalism to deal with the French threat of secession and so candidate began to talk about different kinds of society pluralistic society there was also about quality\nNow the one thing that Lewis F ... junior does not do is talk about equality and in a string of opinions he rarely shuts the door on things like affirmative action reparations a aggressive measures to achieve racial balance of schools\nHe strikes down bussing across school district lines and in that sense that say southern legacy\nWhich is yes on diversity but no I'm government programs to achieve equality\nAnd that we could say is a negative but the thing is power writes the big opinion so he is really the source\nAnd it this is a slice of history that a lot of people don't know that no matter where you live and learn about the civil rights movement or at least can sound the broad outlines and the idea that America is supposed to be integrated and assemble a big\nEconomy that have you had any backlash from presenting the whole point of view and his book\nI I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute\nHow did that have you had any backlash from presenting the whole point of view and his book\nWell I I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century and in fact people have been open to my argument and I think it's because\nMillennials younger Americans are over the moment where we believed full assimilation into mainstream white society was the way to go and I think now of all times not just due to black lives matter movement for black lives but the Trump presidency\nThis is a low point for white folks in this country the Trump presidency is confirming many of the fears and many people had\nThat white people in America are native is their anti immigrant they're fearful of integration their feel fearful of new ideas and if you look at the contrast between the Obama presidency and the Trump presidency the Obama presidency seems to be more aspirational more laudable and forward looking and less riddled with fear and\nParanoia and in a weird way I think folks like Tallahassee coats responded to this and said white America's burning house we need to think more carefully about whether we want to integrate into it that\nUm and then to sort of like buy kismet encountered again when I was just digging for eclectic weird stuff at a record store was that habit a digging for aquatic weird stuff that record stores kinda I I remember on that particular day I went into walks three records in Decatur, Georgia still a very beloved record store for me\nAnd like yeah just with the intention of I'm finding something that would like it seemed like a really cool obscure reference for me to drop the future [laughter] you know I'm a teenager and trying to cultivate I don't know it personality\nThat's a musician a John who are through the magic of radio is with us now but when you hear this she will be living in Los Angeles she's actually going to come back to Atlanta next month on tour for her new album which is called water music well a couple of years ago it was ... that band performed at the early and you've got to perform with them is that how did that come together\nMy God those maybe one of the very coolest thing just happened to me and my life um I have a great relationship with the URL they have always been very kind to me\nMaybe one of the very coolest thing just happened to me and my life\nUm I have a great relationship with the URL they have always been very kind to me over the years and I just sort of begged them I was like can I please from frozen to choose\nAnd they were like yeah that makes sense um [laughter] they answer [laughter]\nSo uh so that happened in what came of it was um the the original founding member who is in that version the band says she does listen to my whole set he reportedly cried during when I sit in front of the sound engineer as their enjoyed my music [noise]\nAnd then he brought me up on stage for their encore song which was one of the first songs by them I'd ever heard any these fancy ...\nAnd I like wept onstage while singing it with them\nAnd triumphant beautiful moment ah after that we stayed in touch and he actually asked me to join the band wow and a ... oh my God it was so insane I was getting like my visa ready to go to Brazil and rehearse with them\nAnd it would have been my first time going to Brazil ever a as a member of my favorite band of all the time and then unfortunately it just kind of fell apart their tour plans just didn't materialize the way they were supposed to and that plan just kinda\nDissolved sadly but you still had your your cry fest onstage at the early on you and I got to know that uh that was what I just thought of me in that way as kind of a member of the family and that\nI don't know it's just something I'll treasure forever that's beautiful and you do thing in Portuguese or at least you did on your last record ... not on this one and so why not uh yeah it's sort of um as soon as just happenstance but I often do right and sing in Portuguese uh I like to think of the language is sort of another instrument [noise]\nBut um as it happened with the ... the songs on this record a lot of my head space was more in kind of an American soul music from the seventies and eighties and also I'm drifting more these days towards composing\nA within intention to be more just sort of directly communicative with my audience and most of my audience is still at this point English speaking ... um [noise]\nSo I'm kinda working a little bit harder on like the stories and what am I telling you and does it matter to you and things like that um but there is a song on the new record that's in French uh it's called mom now\nMy ocean [noise] uh yeah also my mother near ... can you give me that they're on depending on high school\nFrench uh it's called ...\n... ah yeah also my mother near ... can you can be that they're on depending on high school yeah ah so it's a love letter to the ocean\nWondering if you if there's a kind of a different version of yourself you singer songwriter or person\nEach of those languages can you inhabit something else and another thing yeah\nActually sometimes I use it to like this guy is a little bit\nLike if I'm writing about something that's I don't know that I'm just not really ready to\nTell you in English I can kind of have the little secret but no one who knows me well really you know decipher like especially there are a couple of really sad songs that I've written and I don't really like to be publicly sad\nI feel like it gives too much power to the thing that hurts and and I kind of stand by that even though I Know it's not what like a yoga teacher would tell me to [laughter]\nSay to these on their act with the human side and um do I feel like I'm doing my version of that but then I have a couple of songs that are in ... that are about something just really personally really sad and it helps me record it and remember it\nAnd if you care enough you can you know to say for it and share that experience with me but\nIt's still kinda belongs to me in a way\nSo there's a little bit of a mask that I mean I I mean in the artistic sense I'm not saying that being phony or anything like that\nWhich gets cast aside and your new record water music the first thing are you are they from that water music album is called your habitat could you say your habitat for I Would love to be\n...\n[noise]\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nHabitat Meigs in\nMumbai we're none\nWe're in a non\n... I\nMean a\nLot of things you\nKnow living in this thing Oh yes and we did and oh\nYou could and said please tell\n\nMe that you did to me and maybe in Italy and\nYou know\nThe big\nBig emphasis\nOn your habitat performed here in the DVD ... by a drawn from her record called water music\nI Love that ... and if you have trouble believing in the sentiment at this time you could pretend it's the second day yet so that calls to mind for me a sort of slightly faded a film clips of couples walking along over bridges where the leaves fall down and yeah ... what\nAbout like that intro credit you know that Cooper bold followed [laughter] yeah yeah some some bell bottoms in there somewhere that kind of thing when\nThe seventies that ... is it that does that sort of California Sound of music maybe I feel like there's the embrace of the sentimental\nI'm In that area that I relate to\nGuy that we got a little bit jaded about sentimentality after that for sure yeah and I feel like it's starting to come back a little bit I feel like the kind of um [noise]\nThe the craze for like distance irony of the nineties in the thousands of like just starting to dissipate a little bit and ... I don't know a lot of my friends are into some like very very earnest\n... you know on the sleeve music nowadays which is refreshing well beyond the singing and\nMm I don't know a lot of my friends are into some like very very earnest off you know on the sleeve music nowadays which was refreshing\nWell beyond the singing I and I hear that Joni Mitchell phrasing a little bit in there you said you were really a court and spark wasn't big record it really is beyond the singing that you make a lot of sound you didn't and this one but whistle that that sounds less humid and more like a tropical bird how did you discover your talent for whistling\nI'm great question I have no idea\n... I cannot remember starting to do that um I Will offer that I'm just sort of a person who habitually\nAnd it sounds all the time [laughter] um weather just like in the car in the shower I'm just sort of like screwing around was just like sounds all the time so have a quite a few like weird little parlor trick but mostly but whistling is one of my favorites and I\nI don't know maybe in my teens I just started doing it all the time and you can you whistle on command which ...\nOh sure [noise]\n\n\n[laughter] [noise] good thank you [laughter] you could you could you and Andrew Bird you know ... so yeah he's a fantastic Whistler\nI'm aware I've actually publically offered to um battle him in a whistling offers stands but if he takes me up when\nThe war and and you could have happened [laughter]\nSo when this conversation does air we mentioned you're going to be in Los Angeles I'm your music is I think ... for another era in many ways and for Brazilian music from the Nineteen sixties do you think you'll feel nostalgic for Atlanta\nAbsolutely yeah I Love Atlanta very much and um it's bittersweet tearing myself away from it because it let it has been so good to me um and showed me so much support a during my time here", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "11"}
