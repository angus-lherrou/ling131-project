thousand ... many have other cabs\nBarrier to calling a special session some how extraordinary is that\nUm it happens it regularly but it but it has happened on a number of occasions in the last few

have seen it or not they're not American right on it [laughter] and um\nI mean I Love that when ... was running and then ... and early ... house and it's just stuff up and when I start watching reruns

people seemed like a white people so I was like this is not realistic this is not something that is currently going on in the stuff I'm doing a ... a little research has like New York has the most\nUm

I Love her\nUm she's she actually came from Kenya to America to go during ...
