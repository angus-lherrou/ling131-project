glass\nOr win for best actor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and John Randall director of the year in town so\nThought process when you look at a script and decide to do it in the case of playing on a or we know it's not the gods money so one of the personal considerations you apply to the decision\n... shall we start with Bill let's start with Julie [laughter]\nWell\nAh for me it was I'm Alexandra just the mere mention of fire name and then the mere mention of bill are winds name and I would have come and read you know Goodnight Moon [noise]\nWith those two [laughter] and I didn't realize I got I got grand up to the sadness is that we we've completed the gig in just a few short hours but so I Would like to come to her so every day with the scripts I'll hold you\nTo it [laughter] you know when you look at a\nIt speaks to even as you're going on sometimes you don't even get it yet I'm I'm quite sure what's happening here but you do get a sense of a ...\nIt speaks to even as you're going on sometimes you don't even get it yet I'm quite sure what's happening here but you do get a sense of a wood outlined in polls this line and I get an excitement out of the I don't even know what's happening yet but I get a certain excitement sometimes you get the prescription terms you don't [noise]\nAlex has his play ever been produced snow this is the first time I get to hear it read so glorious lay out loud and this is the world's premier production who let there be many in the play the husband and wife referred to each other is bill and Jenny\nBut in the cast of characters in your script they referred to as a wife be the husband what was your thought process there [noise] oh well in writing they seem sort of iconic in terms of the kinds of\nCharacters that might inhabit a very long relationship so it's a envy All right so in your play a says it's too late for me not to be fifty out loud you know what I mean\nMe doesn't want to know what she means can you talk all of a little bit about that moment Alex [noise]\nWatchers me to talk [laughter] I Do watch turning fifty wavy line on TALK because I'm a social work not near as now if I didn't\nQuite a while for someone so young that you'll have somebody inside his daughter and I if I die [laughter] you know and I I really\nHave been forty one and not for that many years I I've just managed to be forty one just for a few years purely window when say out loud what age you or is it verboten in show business or people pretty open about how this is something I kind of love about the Internet you can't buy anymore [laughter]\nSo you know just like so what you just are the age you are\nUm [noise] uh I'm\nThirty nine [laughter] I Am this year fifty fifty so I've had this exact I mean this was reading that that was just so funny that thing when that a A R P card come see you next\nBut there is a serious life altering decision made in this play but the plays also accommodate clearly so Alex would you say finding the humor in situations is something that comes naturally to you\nFirst I suffer than I laugh [laughter] pretty much that's how it's reflected in my writing [laughter]\nWatch special about writing a short play and for that\nAnd then I laugh [laughter] pretty much that's how\nIt's reflected in my writing what's special about writing a short play and for that matter about acting in a short play and directing a short play\nFor me anyway is the director of the uh\nYou have to just get right to the heart of what these characters need and and try to figure that out immediately um there's no there's no breathing room there's no time to to spend developing character and the best way to find is through exactly what they need\nI seen this play or the fame Jenny she needs for freedom she needs to live again\nAnd be is doing everything he can hold on\nTo hold on to what he thinks is actually going to be the rest of his life\nAnd what I think what's great about this performance is that it's a real conversation the natural conversation painful as it is and it comes out of the mundane like the revolution happens usually over the kitchen table and a cup of coffee [noise] and also\nThat idea of that if you come clean about something like that little lie at those couple of years that she was shaving off with all those people it's sort of made her whole existence a bit of a lie so it's like if you got honest about that small thing\nThan it was impossible to be dishonest about anything else [noise] oh\nYeah I hadn't even noticed [laughter] just trying to read the paper I guess [laughter]\nYou know about what was grand about this experience who's the ... version\nOf the whole process that usually it takes place over some weeks now and so John just tough in this up the first time we read it through a couple of lines lobes but we're\nNot looking back to you and I realized oh we were in a kind of a with full G O I guess we're seeing but then on it Alex toughened up in the yeah various takes note that there were that many but ah so that it's it's an active fight to get what you want how scary\nIs it as a writer to reveal what could be interpreted as a personal thing about you\nCertainly being honest about where one is in one's life you know it's [noise]\nIt's risky but if you don't take that risk you're really not you know contributing as a writer I don't think it's great to hear on my fears you know act it out\nIt's risky but if you don't take that risk you're really not you know contributing as a writer I don't think\nIt's great to hear all my fears you know acted out fears concerns and also a lot of my friends are going through stuff like that not mean of course and I feel for their the humanity of the struggle that they're making this transition as I Am into honest older adults would\nI like that you call them a and B the universality of it it's like when you're really young and like when you have a child you always think that your child is maybe the you're the only person who's ever had a child to the older that you get the more you're like oh we're just All right here\nAt the community pool waiting to jump off the diving board we're all in lie by each other I mean you take your number yeah\nWhere it's all it's very similar and I mean wild things are might be a cliche of this woman saying hey I got to make a change because I've still got life to live and I need to live it honestly I didn't\nMake the the the whole play ... make a whole plan going to make an add some musical numbers
