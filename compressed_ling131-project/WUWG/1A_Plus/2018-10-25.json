past few days\nA series of pipe bombs were mailed or delivered by careers to top democratic figures from LA to New York to Washington\nThe bombs were wrapped in bubble wrap and manila envelopes they're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donors George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz listed as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bomb that was sent to John Brennan was sent in care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort [noise]\nI just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and then send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nLater during a rally in Wisconsin and in a tweet the president once again urged unity but he also blame the press for supposedly stoking political divisions this morning the president tweeted quote\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposefully false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nImmediate that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast unquote this story is moving very fast and again there's still a lot that we do not know including who is behind\nThe suspicious devices and what message they exactly we're trying to send will keep to keep you up to speed as quickly as we can do get more details of course on your NPR member station and online at NPR dot org\nLet's get back to our discussion about the Trump family empire and the true nature of President Trump's wealth with Susan Craig and must beating her up in New York Times we welcome more of your questions about this investigation comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nFactor in common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nOne they sold the business ... business is all over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more men devaluation can you give us dissent Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worse factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a value is\nGreat lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus would get a valuations of you know five ten million but on the same man when they had a charitable donation um\nWhere they were a pie valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nThen of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of tax the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce wrote on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich has engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer\n[laughter] those are those are very good\nI there are some of these some of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorney ...\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grand jury attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties [noise] there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose when pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start a kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's\nPatently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kind of things are a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said were\nWealthy people to really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam in these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who ... who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nJeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people every she'd benefits and her father I see this ... story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal that said uh reducing your tax bill through

W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this isn't there\nDot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this is their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on this [noise]\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of the uh the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS get pushed back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does the something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people of course where where problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw evaluations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things to move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix up they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of\nThese allegations or is it is it too late or or their statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told\nThere is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason\nAnd the forties or say based on uh the the recording that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted they'd all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which they don't ...\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred\nThroughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid\nTaxes on it because in America when you have you know lost his you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is it how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble Russ there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that\nTo us so that was in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a a money he owns owed to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling ships took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rain down to ... for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the Trump might have faced at that\nAnd make an example of them how much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted well\nBig one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they've and pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only ... taxes but penalties in interest on the money the toad so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities 'em and other authorities could be looking at um\nWhat it is because they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yet those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought\nAnd freedom and Jay tweeted
