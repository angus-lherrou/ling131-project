of a massive\nCorruption scandal and it's stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current

Fernando ... died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including both in our owes near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also

here pleasure to be well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honor is here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAre both scenarios a retired army\nArt or let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\n... knows a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow um but despite having sat in Congress\nFor so much time and he he shows open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress has different dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists in and other\nPolitical opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages are resonating a lot more with people\nWhen they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed\nLike just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nNineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people suggest that most of the world uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit ah we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... an hour with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to do ... in the Philippines likes to Wade guns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatened to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for an ... of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nTell what we know about going on and he's not a ... member of the Workers Party the tea um he's someone who is ...\nOh about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the tea um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow um is this anti PT vote so\nThese elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend\nThat we're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Palo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls or what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a\nDecisive in terms of for going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up or we may have less of a proportion this time or\nOne important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday or we're both from a win\nFifty percent of the salad devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday [laughter] uh we're both from a winning more like the according to the late ... that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil a\nRegardless if they are the last from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up\nWith politics with politicians and that there is no alternative to because there is not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm\n... has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or the eaves\nAt seven o'clock but don't wait until the closing minutes of this one drive to a a make your contribution make sure we hear from you know eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight or TPP dot org\nAnd only takes just a couple of minutes it's not going to take you a lot of time to do that to go ahead and do it knock it out there to do list and go ahead and know that every time we take our supporters which we thank our supporters a lot for talking to you when you support CPB now at gp dot org or when you give us a call at eight hundred to two to four seven eight\nPublic radio is a partnership everyday we do the best job we can to bring you radio programs that are informative and enjoyable but we can't do it without your support listener supported ... most important in a reliable source of funding we're committed to you and now we're asking you to make the commitment to us\nJoined the public radio partnership today with your contribution online at gp dot org or call us at eight hundred to two to four seven eight the drive ins tomorrow they don't put it off until the last day or the last minute cut a G.

T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know things that the the workers' party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMatt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states of Paolo ... makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star and not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top are now terrible recession arable corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics and was and was on the way up\nRocks in Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined can be great\nAnd forgot to do the necessary things you'd do in order to build the country or one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers ... was led\nBy a man born in poverty a that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics\nA man born into poverty or that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics there is this sense after Brazil a\nA basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international law makes me producer of commodities had a wonderful moment poverty was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a\nThan reality hit a ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a\nLot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are\nAnd another thing that this poll showed the positive is the fact that the states in Brazil he's basically broke\nThey only have run off the money ah\nAll that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government says run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff and on popular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to go from the ships\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion\nWell if you look around right now the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring [noise] um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program\nI feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned touch the degree of cynicism the degree of\nThis is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you mentioned Todd and the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail months of\nCivil civil liberties and and and other things I I in my time I'm this week\nUm I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile guy and this just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule\nNineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was a real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and you know maybe", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "04"}
