I I ... she is literally leaping out for sure go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe mansion that Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes he's in college his voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced\nHe was voting yes on the coach of it but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because states afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision that we don't know necessarily what this procedural vote to me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote\nIf those positions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe for ... senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this\nVote in the next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nThat goes on and they'll bring that debate took clothes and they will set a time most likely tomorrow a and which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any minutes I mean one of the things about this at it as it\nRuns anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have a senator from Montana uh uh the Danes whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk down the aisles so ushered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out campaigning and\nHe'd noting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners is because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible yeah not\nOne of these votes that you do one of these what you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly has his uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one years forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes\nBut his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nAbsolutely I think everything or just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea that David Brooks tapped them\nTo today in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um an concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but we haven't\nSeen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that\nI mean if I if I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the cabinet nomination to the broader side in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate\nIs is also hedging on this that if Manchin were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes have him losing that state so there are different they're different issues here one is what what is the future prospects of\nA the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the cabinet or nomination itself and this lifetime appointment but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "05"}
