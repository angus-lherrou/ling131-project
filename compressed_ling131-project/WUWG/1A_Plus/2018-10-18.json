A. M. U. dot for them and I wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked Casey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning\nPeople off you know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts\nAnd going as hard as they can I ... in their political corner so I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activists they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact\nWe're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest for seeing high turnout in primary than in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nI Wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential play but for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with it\nTake is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats the Democrats need to flip the house\nChurch that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing that they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there's a reason for that typically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections typically older whiter and more Republicans ... Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark won or for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get above sixty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up of some ten feet or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three as turning be the house bill in the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\n[laughter] you know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering impossible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nThe minute let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do well when\nWe look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the ...\nOur nearest polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballad who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of Kavanaugh\nYou know that confirmation battle enthusiasm Republicans and it certainly did only six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that\nAnd you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\nTo hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about them in terms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the go I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left in ... in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with directions with not having enough\nHoles in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own and then for and you know with a razor close or not if a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some calls to ah to divide and it it actually changes my boat Nepal change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Domingo that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nUh I get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to [noise]\nAnd the and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues\nVote your conscience\nYeah

I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for\nTax or the Democrats who have done ... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's point that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush [laughter] yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy\nThat Democrats are firmly against and it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with\nUh as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties saying for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes what's the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Katie\nAnd I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs a Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because the defective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it is a memorable\nAnd it certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here fact checkers [laughter] that's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L G T two candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to stay on those strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected moment talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for a for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those hundred and eighty three has been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running aren't that would be bigger than the record previously of all women\nHas been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running aren't that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined do or nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo because I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman but nominees\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll\nAnd you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nThere are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean there is on the Senate races going on right now between ... and send them the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have\nA female senator in that seat I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative women\nFrom the local those local level seats all the way up so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list a group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when female candidates so there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "18"}
