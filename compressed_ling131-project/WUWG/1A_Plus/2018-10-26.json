A. M. U. dot org\nAdam ... before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet\nFrom Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already said beliefs how do we break out of this show the people that does you disagree with are still human\nAdam [noise] boy uh I don't know\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mono culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believed to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe that but I think\nAnd in life and what we want government to do ... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe that but I think\nIt has increased in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then you just the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nGuess that's because I'm a report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd usually and I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program is on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listen to I mean I understand the idea about the division but\nIf you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one aid to criticize us if you hate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize it\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it\nAnd it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nGoing to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend the increase just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions about\nWhat has happened there already been some details of this story that had been clarified or walk back so that's

take is on the use of the word nationalist versus the patriots particularly because words like nationalist often heard\nOr take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriot particularly

to this proposed changing the definition of sex by a church as in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he is insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit casinos the people in the room clearly do not want her there what do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on the street just cats you know it's been really\nFascinating see or is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for

for not a being a a boat advocate of the transgender a community and and center has been\nA critique for parents that have just noticed that one of the things that most fascinated by a I think this

writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it was just one of those amazing moments about how different Americans here different banks\nTo get to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed when was the meaning of gender

remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place\nAt the Washington National cathedral shepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the October of Nineteen Ninety eight by men who targeted the Twenty one year old University of Wyoming students for being gay his death was a wakeup call for many Americans to violence against the L GDP cue people today's ceremony drew hundreds to the cathedral for a musical event\nThat included several of shepherds favorite songs including imagine by John Lennon\nLet's get to some more of your comments including about the refugee caravan and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan as a possibility the care of it is real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by way of misspoke when I brought that up Bryan emailed\nIs this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on our door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the caravan of what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by a two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand also on right now is lots of your commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there\nIrrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump to use the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American\nAnd Matthew tweeted or match tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism seems that came to the right rounding socialism up to ... both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his time\nSo let's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nAnd this and I hate to say that but I don't think he has a point [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to his base maybe trying to expand his base because the original tax cut that he promised\nI don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out\nFor this election and I asked them how do you see it\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now and I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit\nBy even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh bought them all in all Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happened to be in a big group it's more
