A. M. A. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nSilly Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics is always welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nJoshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them\nIn the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas with regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... and just 'cause turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds to like sixty percent\nTiger in eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state [noise] Michael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd more expected this morning we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots and\nBrian ... what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's ... there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know a mirror saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me sick with you how does early voting works in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out is Kansas handled voting early well it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county and the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request steady and you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who liked early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option we heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to\nFor early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballots Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how this early voting work\nWell basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you say you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here to Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to ... ...\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm a you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nGlad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November sixth tens and I I don't know how it is for\nYour three states but every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is um jak mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day and not a postal carriers hand ought election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day do you have to la\nChicken we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan for\nAll practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early uh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to\nSupport for TB comes from you our listeners\nAnd the George alliance lighthouse foundation the

branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt

through the ... what would you say the trucks call was that a kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting as he is ... and then proposals three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um\nYes ah particularly a problem too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a a barn storm of a\nBallad I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays for signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians is propped to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Fay he's twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures again grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is ...\nFour hundred fifty thousand signatures again grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which if past will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de ... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures\nAnd who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan does tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out well\nI mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm [laughter]\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get the money from other device organization just last week or putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is the promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races and Jennifer's in Colorado and she left this voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nOne twelve on our ballot this year for the increase the distance between new oil development and any building that\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that\nIs designed for him and I see it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me that the ads me see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by the company and they say you're going to lose all your job all your schools are going to close\nFires going to rain down from the sky it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that Jones says she's ... she's been seeing on TV ads\nSure it will be a ... to put a fire point on it right now there are also a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells\nAre just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's homes schools places at work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh they admit pollutants um the oil so the other side of this as the oil and gas industry which is which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site a but just how difficult that is well you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
