Hamdani from Georgetown University welcome more of your questions and stories as well especially if you were directly affected by this conflict we love to hear from you if you or Yemeni or Yemeni American or Saudi Saudi American what does this conflict and America's role in it mean to you\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at\nOne at a or email one a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to a Yemeni friends in Sana'a and saw the are living in hell and they ask why does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSomeone before we continue in before we bring our next forces on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex complex\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that it's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that has he got ... at the ... the government and sign on that announced itself is actually in fact\nA coup government that is run by a militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power and Yemen and now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no so see I'm bullish on the ground\nAnd on top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in a sense that at first they had to share power with\nUh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven young and had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with her knees and was president for some time but uh the hair power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had to kill them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nPower with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the hook English I had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies\nAre for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is it is suffering and and need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want us all the above the population on the ground but needs help I just want to before we were next wars and also didn't want to be clear this is a very important to you know these\nThese are the rebels kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslims period aspect to this also there's so many versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as ... and it's really different from twelve or ... which is a ... form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sects of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the CDs or the who the sect\nOf of what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they do use them as it is it seems like they're trying to politicize say DSM into kind of\nAssociate themselves more with the Iranian sect of Shia Islam and the ... has struggled to maintain its effect as it is with the influence of well how does them instead of them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the ...\nHas struggled to maintain its\nEffect as it is with the influence of well how does that mean Salafis them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two are fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country and the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost secession\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground and human but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact was ... she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen\nLeast laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working bear here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago\nWe've gone to welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that he steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as four king ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd killing everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation and I'm sure was deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right [noise] last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history kid came in and they were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the work work that's being done\nWatery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the heroic work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of and how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months\nOn supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely what we're saying for millions of people in this country there are immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections had water borne diseases including color\nAnd just by way of contacts lose mentioned that there are fourteen million people of the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of contacts at least give me a sense of what a mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now\nG.

A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask\nThem if they were tracking with us and one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too is the nature of this secretary and aspect like several of us and we have a an array of of age ranges here students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of ...\nTerry and aspect like several of us and we have a range of of a dream just hear students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sex within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make ... these people are with like why why does the second one is the sex involved matter to this can you just got him simplified force\nAbsolutely so when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned um the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say D and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the\nChef ... they're called ... now the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation of religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about the chefs in a conflict\nIt's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle East that are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian if she has them\nAnd Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of ... and so as soon as she our is pretty much\nKind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started we know that the U.S and then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrifice damaged by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate\nThat today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nLet me let me was I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said ah so I've been granted diagram everybody here ... been watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam swimming\nBut you just said ah so I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... you've been watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and she is laments his old centuries old fight that has been made political you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow Iran is kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim faith\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of noise that itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith\nAnd that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\n[noise] care yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that Kennedy's have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi Iranian sex for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good sums up all around or if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard for\nUs sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our T fan but your reporting has involved some people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you describe the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June but kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\nTelling her story is one of the race for the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just to test steaks and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in ... and which is a product and sort of in northwest of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd that and it's ... and the in the town of hijacking the capital of the pilots there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen\nIs controlled by the who the rebels and uh and it's mountainous in the in the town of hide in the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man\nTall desperately thin\nRushed and with the with the tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was hit eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too I think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctors about and it was absolutely a\nHorrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so\nAmong nourished they also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get food to the ... and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in\nUm we spent some time they're filming with my ... speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school\nBut whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stop to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen once those salaries stopped", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "24"}
