and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem so technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions\nIt was ... with a policy solutions won't we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewables carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period that elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling

opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation in Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that season and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe it and you know\nThis is the pizza around recognizing how difficult information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like the earth to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to that that science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that is actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nTo the the way that we unpack\nThat it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust and empathy because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [laughter] I anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions with shanta into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just digging a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit because they're not going to be around it collects you know what I'm saying like it just feels like\nAn intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWhy one so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.S Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line on it the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive shift we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet\nOur courage by looking at the story that for example the water protectors

website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try\nQuestion on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change that do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that they will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have to the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is\nAn imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean [noise] bad things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that ... those protections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate\nTemperature and carbon concentrations in ... we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess you should not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise] [laughter]\nYes and there's so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season Audi of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nPeople get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate where we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... authorizations between glacial an inter glacial states abrupt warming and to enter glacial\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons of Sarah\n... logging into changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial state last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like like bringing on earth for me\nOkay so in the last ... million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states\nWhere there's an ice on top of North American and erasing continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate um and then in inter glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift this um this piecing this I'm off the leash and it's called it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate\nAnd that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric\nIn earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you just yeah heartbeat this first heartbeat between whole too warm or Cold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it\nTo us is that what you're saying that's exactly right on like ... okay that makes a youthful pattern\nThat's been a ... that's been happening for the last million years\nIn years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that things that they are at like ... okay that makes a little full pattern that's been that's been happening for the last million years\nWe uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern I was saying well we're on a super high cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood\nPressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever\nThat will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distrust individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied
