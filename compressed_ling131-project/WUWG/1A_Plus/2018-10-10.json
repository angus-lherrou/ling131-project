listen\nI thought [noise] ... ... ... and that I failed to stop the the way round\nI pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world that is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still\nMore companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of on the inevitable path um two thousand four to you will be here before we know it and we will reap the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Amy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted China uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference\nConsidering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a ... actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax or all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWere some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest um solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker\nThe spectrum ranging from Ben Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers\nAnd of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder carbon ... plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nOkay and they just connect to the organization or use it as a spin off but is there still a connection in any way or completely separate\nIt is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by\nFormer Republican Senate majority leader Trent law and a a center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder before it let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically to find this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um [noise]\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and ah in in in ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of\nEvery kind of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time when\nI'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost that once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon pollutes\nUm create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters have carbon dioxide no we do\nKnow a lot of carbon cruel it's going to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car Baker do I pay the talking about pollution from automobiles does the carmaker\nPay carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone that term actually\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm okay and and and and ... so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S. um so in some ways this this is sort of um\nYou know an intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would\nDrive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of a moral sensibility but because actually at a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon difference plan is based on four pillars of the first is a real bus carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any\nA leading emitting country all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan\nAnd a third pillar is that where you would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon\nAnd this plan and a third pillar is that where you would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulations simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nThe law just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of of a dividend is that what you called\nYes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs or planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "10"}
