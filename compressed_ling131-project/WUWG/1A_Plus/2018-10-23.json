Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal\nUS ambassador to the un and the author of Reagan at Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions like what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty\nIf it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's and Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty those are good\nQuestions uh and uh it's unclear and the constitution would Congress's role would be in getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ratified\nBy the Senate uh and uh in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump presents in Nineteen eighty seven a but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty or is the president's discretion and Congress has no role in that\n[noise] can you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there is a threat from North Korea there is a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to inch closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where is where does is it\nJust is a pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against a whole class of nuclear weapons okay to me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear uh treaties and nuclear threats are\nThat are bound by treaties is the nonproliferation treaty which really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons to spread\nAnd are by and large that's been pretty successful Joshua or the fact is in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy there would be twenty five nuclear weapon states\nBy Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six seven and so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to ... uh to me the best law\nSix seven and so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nAnd the ... the liberation of nuclear weapons was a disaster that did that and so and so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact of the treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know Internet connections are a little tense right now\nRight it was and certainly the weekend in record back in October eleventh and twelfth Nineteen eighty six that document and my book and thank you for mentioning it or that will be turned into a movie probably soon a\nIs an exciting roller coaster of up and down and motions up as it got\nUp and down views in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produced the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy tug\nOf for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night\n'til six thirty the next morning going over the details are vast and I could report to the president the next morning on the type of job or twelfth Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night\nThan we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians [laughter] it was just a ... weekend\nBefore we move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if by way of wrapping up our conversation I could ask you about the leaders who signed this treaty Ronald Reagan and we called Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with it [noise] much minister general secretary do my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise]\nMaximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify\nCheney and some of the city is you end up all\nAt every meeting [noise] from the meeting\nIn Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allowed this treaty to come to fruition\nThough when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of\nGorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua\nOr in the sense that um [noise] you know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't agree with the policies\nBut the decency of the man the humble ... the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs probably sorry are probably some who CAD openly quality and the president or they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua\nAnd or the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country is a whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having ... at any time and he was very intense ... reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were classic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump's but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend in record back in Ninety six\nKenny it'll ... author of ... forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik an extra wide I'll work on it I think very much very got back\nTo Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal followings they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and the revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nFill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nThat's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula no one checklist that defines all leaders\n...

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nQuote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in rules and people who get people to do things that even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous we think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThat day I retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day than a short conversation\nHe just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better sometimes that's not the leader who\nI think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nPushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end if you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot like typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our wheat demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd their leader can use them on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is change the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nFor the second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty tend and [noise]\nI thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and how would therefore be to star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhat I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part\nAnd so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation of putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we\nSpotlight following the leader no matter where they are all the other things in this situation putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven tour so he kind of he kind of wanted it that way\nWeights very calm and I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like ... the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York to co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are [noise]\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city":
