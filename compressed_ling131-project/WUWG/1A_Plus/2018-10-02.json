let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're

program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote an unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have ten and colleagues itself just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips and pride of of ours\nSo I'll just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nOn my own experience king you sure we'll just what a recent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um [noise] you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nRougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise and um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nOften to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I find the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but [noise]\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so he really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame [noise] I'm In what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which\nAnd about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends and you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on [noise]\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor Ford what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor records set\nIn ... in the head the campus is the laughter for is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nWere full searching you explain for us from a neurological perspective why is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has a separate parts that are involved too in code fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react\nWell escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart costs you know it's really emotional\nUm but for get other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are relevant in the moment the assault is happening so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nKind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you describe that it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walk in drawing in house you forget all the decor but the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin derives bats wouldn't codes that I Would have great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Laurie I bet you poured Lawrence Taylor\nYour adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes no more you said that a moment she's mia Lauren and Lauren Taylor these moments that in code so intensely are there ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with some\nThings that kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ...\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self

Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into\nName is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth which she weighs thirty six years of it it really happened it must be a lie and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone\nYou feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and covert and so it shaped\nWhoops thanks very much for sharing your story with us more geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the\nComes after that it's been like that after an attack like that\nWhile it's powerful um [noise]\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault a it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number as friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social research or you know any shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel like huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe it belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but caring for them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it\nMakes me very angry and and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment\nOf that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from Lawrence [noise]\nI just wanted to\nSpeak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very honorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone\nWho feels unable to tell or who makes that choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\n[noise] Sarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend on top of me still inside me\nI never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me\nWhen I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently
