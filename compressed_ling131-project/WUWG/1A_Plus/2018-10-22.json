A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida\nAbout what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the richest part of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state Larry\nThat is a such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impacts of hurricane Michael [noise] ah we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of trees come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers\nTo the western panhandle just west of us to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nUm is there no consequence there for liberty and and they were part of a of our state they is often been\nForgotten forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help the defining economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nWe add one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels as climate change progress is\nAnd it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building\nMatter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures\nOf homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the homes that were were standing and homes and weren't we're we're we're tooth picks basic that tries that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf\nBut it is not safe to live here you know it's\nIt's such a fair point an ... and ... and ... and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and a lot of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increase storms I'm particularly the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't lift that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean\nWhat less than right now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes\nI'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an and resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nWith these increase storm at a dance and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there is a panacea I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be happening to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments I Want\nTo reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda senses to take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly loved to have him on the program [noise]\nWhat's that one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a a Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nRadio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a a Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to know that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the VW well around listening area including Palm Beach Florida in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nOne Luis good to hear your voice again a I'm a to 'em and well aware and thankful for you remind you at the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government ... um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together they help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money and modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update\n'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a Oliva\nI'm here and I spent some time together for two years or making our way through 'em in Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now that don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together may be able to afford about housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get\nI also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party\nWith the speaker of the house in with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part is and you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue but in public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville\nUh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform one of the critical points have your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these

I think Trump won ten thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages [noise]\nUm but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted in Yvette\nI'm I'm buddy quest for getting them I'm a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... doll\nEr which way it really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies and just to give you an example of I think how waited impacting us\nIs that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voter turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins and the one who get one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of this day so I'm prepared to go there\nWere gonna win because we're going to get voted a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners press will have a chance to talk to you again but one more a matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... to make two questions from two of our listeners by email GM emailed\nMe or Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard at their till the stand your ground as it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine\nBut I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders 'em up onto the property right\nI'm Sorry I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between we're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home or at war is stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel ... anywhere you have a window right to be just to anywhere\nYeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCatholic doctrine already production your home there's already common last self defense which means I in places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force\nThere's already case law on the books where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is is is it is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children\nAnd black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin case of ... the case of murky smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and they're seeing\nA book criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both had weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover\nFor for legitimate illegal practices that our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with ...\nPractices that our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to ... stand your ground as a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ...\nSo I Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these radical how was to buy the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nIn case you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic [laughter]\nThat was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was worse than decency here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency back into it\nAndrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate you making some extra time for
