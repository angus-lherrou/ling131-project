A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren release this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing this story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump to in some of these arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could have Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nIn some way or it will just go ahead go it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook him out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's ... that's ... in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll\nGive you the way in which um you know parochial editor you I've been around for Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections sounded telling the gifts so they brought up a typically these people you know our presidential runs for ...\nAnd for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling the gifts so they brought up\nA typically these would be people in our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... and Alec Baldwin and\nWe haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who have drawn the most attention of the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear lose their favorite but sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again this week the Democratic he debated his Democratic challenger but so O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used the President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or don't use what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably ah throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lion tad um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat at the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can access\nHe wants to take in his campaign whether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some pope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was gonna ask you whether or not what you read was on whether this could work I mean the ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nA rather progressive Democrat like over ... has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators Neal reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in terms of typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gaffe\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nI don't like Sunday of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think and under covered aspect of this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in ... for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even as better over ark has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically towns that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically don't forever Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that uh it won't be as easy\nFundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers out raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than sixteen democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars the courts\nIn the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans ... raised thirty million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nThis is by five thirty eight they're Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nGather still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town and Mexico beach has not reporting given any numbers um of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nSupport for G.

A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely in Framingham party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nOffices for a long time he's in his late thirties he family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester awesome stuff for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nI'm Betty Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time lived estates a enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief [noise]\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of it\nUh I was a fairly big job he a random enforcement division and he's been a police chief [noise]\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has\nYou know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways tried to cast Chris Pappas those you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've got to see the nationally uh you know Chris Pappas is hardly a radical guy or you know family run restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um [noise]\nAnd uh this race is one where the seat can do either way and both parties believe they have a shot\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway here at the Republican government Governor Christie new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she's won a Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number the latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican\nThree to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to helped campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened was here ... brands listen listen\nHow family now we're going to help people to be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for a family medical leave and how important it is for people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working\nBut then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that most when they're needed notes\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test when she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge to somebody covering their first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute\nIs vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\n'em in the Democrats believe this is a need for that works for Raleigh Kelly by doing to have her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who worked her way through college and that you know Christian new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy [noise]\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know their wage growth for people to lower end of the scale\nThere's not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race whoa I'm ...\nYou know Sunni should win or do we have to your terms here no governor's been promised after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nHere polling indicates that the new news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers in Mali has outrageous person and he's three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but this is a race said Democrats feel they\nHave a chance to win if if a blue wave of and she waits and they think that Molly Kelly a bite in her background but in being a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking of nationally\nKnown names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator Gillibrand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is there's speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty [noise] um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously I there's so many names being kicked around or\nBush and about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate is is the big question I mean obviously there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed ran as one of the people that\nThat people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nA that she makes 'em is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nPlus to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars gets a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo ... a trillion dollars the deficit ... trillion dollars\nNo Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being\nResponsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\nWe haven't seen that yet certainly and in fairness Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out do at this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nUm it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "19"}
