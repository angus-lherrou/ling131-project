I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the block\nThe man who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... tech after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nHere certainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book that\nI you know for those of us who were industry and for a gift in we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we're in history for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis who organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest\nA sabbatical important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of history together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organizations to like what a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain\nPeople certain leaders to become more prominent\nWas concerned about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIt's it's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked to like it's public that\nSo it's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked so like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the ... portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it because it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of this and when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of wreaths for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits than we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first I was a database of police shooting contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I'm a salary from this stuff's so we try to do it it's like it\nWould just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit uh\nAnd with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um\nAnd it's not like some you know huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a\nComplex to like fund our work to do this really well and you know it's a guy at\nThe way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a\nKnowledge at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly it's only a couple of months ago the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've I've since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their rights second parents that thought\nMy second parents after the past three years right so you know so that's not as as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable [laughter] but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives and like oh I made ... billion dollars and ... and it's like well now you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like the me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before you know that they their income and wealth is pretty significant though um\nSome people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are

I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name\nAnd one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave and I like that is something I've had that sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like\nWe're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it out that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty rates that or any other aspect of identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know\nYou think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect to they ... they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew what passed for and what not to ask where I knew that when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know about a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up\nAnd it's sometimes we still only the uh world of constraint semi constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my mother never seen the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never eaten any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nHere you know one of the reasons I was important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean amount for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way\nTo do this or it publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from the street that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real frantic times in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important though there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collect evidence to suggest as are the work that we need to do without talking about\nThe work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like ...\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they ... and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and you know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he'd actually been\nSexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important [noise] um but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to\nBe in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were appear than we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attributes where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my identity and they have to be\nHere you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that they're not two ways to be gate and like\nThe pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right so\nSo yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like that I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves that unlike other people can feel like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like\nYou know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re\nFelt like I Know that we know we're working with the research right now and trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that it's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or their their necessarily afraid of the results but that are that they're actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns\nIn a nervous about seeing somebody went to high school with things like somebody's cars and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right\nAnd like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like direct she cares about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'd say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's not helpful but I don't want to be like a safe spot for your eight\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quotes\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding
