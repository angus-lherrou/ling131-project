Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program [noise]\nThank you Joshua no I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such a stern did it has to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\nAbsolutely dash law I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that\nSome of my fellow officers were actually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and there for I began and operation dumped operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use that term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately bad to\nLead these officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular\nAmong the rank and file within to Chicago\nAnd that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nOr they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nOwned or one vote is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement in my family but I've never taken a ... I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because the drugs all of us do why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\nKill honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct\nOn his police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence is so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there's this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nIn corrupting the officers who were working with me not to back me up or they would be the next Shannon Spalding\nSo out of fear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and\nEasier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to\nDang it ... it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officer didn't want to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\n... let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the corner McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin graph\nI Do I Do believe in something about the last several years of use this case one thing\nI Want to remind everybody ran for millions of dollars every every every year\nSupport for CPB comes from you our listeners\nAnd the west in Hilton Head island resort in spot an oceanfront resort sediments pristine beaches information on planning a meeting or then at the new grand ocean terrorists it's available at West in Hilton Head island dot com\nAnd Kennesaw state school of communication and media master's program in global communication hosting an open house October eleventh it's six PM more information that Kennesaw dot edu slash N.

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin shed and Spalding Patrick Smith and judge la Doris Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is it very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun\nHowever Galvin had these questions Calvin writes the question is what is reasonable disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nAs a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot while they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions\nTo Cornell maybe you should respond to ... and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable and this is\nThe uh\nThe Gulf and how do we saw so you know minor sense what reasonable mess\nWe said well this is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers dating experiencing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it\nBut but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is quasi militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a\nPatrol and and take care of traffic issues why\nCan't that come from within the community why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim ... disagree with you or just by way of doing some places we're a lower level of sworn in law enforcement officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nCure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not\nTo say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWhen we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers so don't turn the Amazon or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on that for example ... shooting so that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nIs very little sunshine and police say we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history discipline is very very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that those tales with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland list in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have\nAnd experiences where you know we should simply you know would rather have conflict with uh with I mean rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the guns for the first couple of months but bleach to buy cheap\nIt's out of the community without guns make them stand up comedian before she might have a dialogue with the community I think it'd be a lot better uh which serving their communities\nWhere she thinks we're calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that\nBut if I could first if we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners what Scott ... wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in all people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict them but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nKnew what would you say to folks who say that police word\nIs inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to make it home at night so I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know\nThat was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue the when you develop\nThat left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving and you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge courthouse had come\nOut used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWhere you know none of the people who are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship [noise]\nThis goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important where the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political political through the unions and its political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides may come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it",
