I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh ... worries some folks that you [noise]\nSure well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech than when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read [noise]\nHas been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against tells you ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat hatred is being supported and bold and from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody on the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite\nSometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he highlighted\nGeorge Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into\nVery old anti Semitic troops are so we yeah\nArch conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic ... yeah I I\nI'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that a lot of talks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil\nOf anti Semitism and every other form of people and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nAmerican people [noise]\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nSupport for CPB comes from you our listeners\nIf you're already a gp sustain or thank you you're reliable monthly donations provide a steady stream of support for the programs you enjoy an gp be\nNot as sustain or yet there's a gp dot org and become one right now you were secure ongoing gift of five or ten dollars a month will feel great and it'll keep gp be strong for you and your community\nThat's G.

Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope\nAfter the massacre [laughter] it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is he could be as prejudiced and rude as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money [noise]\nBase in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant ramps if not you who make America kind again [noise]\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like\nHearing the comments on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI mean it's on our air we will hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd close next to the state of Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small school here in the city and far in this in the suburbs and a lot of us didn't do feel uncomfortable on college campuses and feel that um\nYou know if they express a\nStrong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views\nThat they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you were home schooled deals with it\nBut I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we mean there are students who are you know are not typically\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um but our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left and that if that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we tell we do kids probably shouldn't have made to shut up you know they set up by the you know you can't argue with every that's\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing to pick\nTheir battles I sent me an I ... I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that and not\nThe non federal everything will David I'm but can be it can be very hard to even let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs ... what do you make of David comment\nThank you day that I wanted to respond best to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say that the first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you let it be very clear that there certainly is\nBut of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred and for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself as a\nAs a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which is not you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism [noise]\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy is we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store and had your store in a synagogue [noise]\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a British racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and\nRiling up his people to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation as many of your calls as we can as well as the sea run on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nTo return her Facebook page yesterday's interest for your service in Pittsburgh\nThe world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nAnd wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship held to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better\nIndia would you react to that I feel like part of what worked I hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIs it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pit and a lot of the people who live in squirrel hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers account ... dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community\nAnd it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta it's just four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis news written the capital Gazette", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "29"}
