I'll child journalism and and so I I started taking political science courses and communication and I was like oh I think I'm going to be a diplomat\nThat's really hard to\nOn so then you know and then I did it was like okay you know what I'm going to figure it out maybe law school who knows um and then yeah and then I kept on trying different things until I got here\nAnd did you did you take a acting classes or did you just start auditioning like how to transition happened\nWell I went to performance art high school right on when I was a kid I when I was in high school and so I was very familiar with the arts and I really loved it when I left college I started taking acting classes so I just went to like beginning acting and beginning improv and so I kept on taking classes like that and I moved to New York\nAnd I I joined us a school that was sort of like a cold\nIt was scary um but it really did prepare him you know hey\nIt held yeah yeah there were certainly a big on thick skin um oh yeah they uh they made me cry every day somehow I could not crying a damn thing [laughter]\nSo I what I did was I just started auditioning and then I started working\nYeah yeah and this is graduation season and you just gave a commencement speech at your alma mater Andrew received an honorary doctorate ...\nUs out it was it fun oh\nGod it was great it was great yeah and I and I I've been doing more of these um within the last two years I've been giving talks a different universities um\nBut I've gotten better and so this one um it was special because I was actually getting a degree along with everybody else and I actually didn't uh get my degree from rate is when I went there I was like a semester\nUm it was special because I was actually getting a degree along with everybody else and I actually didn't uh get my degree\nFrom rate is when I went there I was like a semester you're ... yeah yeah she credits so this was pretty grim scene but of course all I I went to a Catholic all women's college now it's not all women's anymore but you know all all of my um the ... there were still nuns teaching our professors\nA and they all came up to like this is nice but you can finish [laughter]\nYou can finish you you just have a few critics left him like just leave me alone on line classes call me later [laughter]\nYour big acting break came in two thousand and twelve when you were cast in orange is the new black as Murray to re most a Bronx bread character with Colombian roots\nNow it seems that the show managed the impossible it's a huge ensemble cast where everyone supposedly liked each other uh what is the secret ingredient just just\nBe around women [laughter]\nHave every wouldn't be a woman [laughter] and I\nYou know from experience of foods are really great environment you know it's funny 'cause people I Would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women riding\nHis you know the scale is the competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women in in spaces where it's like\nFemale run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really love being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nGap and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old they were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage yeah um\nI you know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider looking in and you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind\nYou want and the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that doesn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story\nUm luckily I thought maybe my voice could be an asset stare at it that way because\nEspecially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and and different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf we can move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWas it was like cats at a bag and they had to do all this work [laughter]\n\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh here's the rub it in all and I'm like nobody wants to get me a job [laughter] you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on and and here I Am putting myself in his vision now do all this work on top of this work\nYeah and it also led to obviously you decided to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah a cold in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah and that it is called my family divided one girl's journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy book um money people come up to me all that\nWhat is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy\nBook I ever heard that um people come up to me all the time it's like mom to your book I read it in one sitting it's easier and\nI I uh the younger students [laughter]\nStudents have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult\n[noise]\nSo yeah that's why you found it easy [laughter] and now this may more your story is being developed as a television series well trying okay I'm In talks\nRight now of developing 'em either a series or a town I'm I can take in many different directions but that sort of like uh when I'm getting into right now animated series on all those yeah\nYeah I Want to make it into a children's book actually I'm very interested in that and then you know or the
