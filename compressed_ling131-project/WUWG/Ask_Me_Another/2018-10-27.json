journey yes\nVerify with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nI was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title in Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nYeah that hurt that when I heard a little bit I've gotten over it but you know what they were talking about it oh no they\nThey said the the name of shepherd shift and you just said we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm other guys I got this audition how cool is going to be a and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands\nI like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincident it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of ... voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do it\nYeah as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure\nUh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know\nWorking on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad and I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um\nAnd the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina land out of the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice is pretty important [laughter]\nI like to cook or\nYou said you're you are studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did you not\nYeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah\nI had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of his workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I've I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid and DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and he said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious bad\n\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moment so\nThis show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you weren't jumping in the air\nFor what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been already has shown me up on six wow yeah

[noise]\nUm but yeah I mean like\nAnd I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he was like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends ended up his community\nIn front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one\nPeople tend to be taken over by their fear and buy their hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and wet sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\nThat feels really like a\nAll right are you ready for an ask me another

sat on the idea that was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right um I and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\n... and his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom are threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking
