we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind existential threats of being ...\nMy argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nHas since become relevant just because they fired a risk for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nAnd it actually doesn't feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow the when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran somebody called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly and a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nOr used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation we were kicked out of the America\nWeek on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at no point in Google or any ...\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at\nNo point Google or any ... only to fire Mary Landrieu\nAnd we look at how corporations use philanthropy to shape the public debate and that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\n\nIt's freakonomics radio show that explores banking died of every ...\nHere's your house and got married\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine\nWe were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses though we had a real inside look at how global positioning actually works for the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe the corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated\nThis was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation and its project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWell yeah the work going and we did it with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty six chain\nWe had a number of folks on the hill trying to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she is on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms\nIn the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms out lots of companies depend on for survival by physical apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with that small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nAt least two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risks of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who is now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to\nLeave Princeton and and become head of New America which was a big move because I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton or was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future\nAnd the digital age but as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the five permanent plays and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is ... is um [noise]\nIt was new or work a new American problematic for Google Google Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the boards at school was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair\nOf our board Eric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years she stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn ...\nAnd if Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years she stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is a relationship that goes back to the early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we release this statement and support of the decision in Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty ninth I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're\nHeadline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us similar version of events he made it clear that Lynn's statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous in supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by their treatment\nGoogle and New America was very generous in supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly outraged by the treatment of very and I can't resigned from New America because I'm not affiliated with them and not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nI pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we do the evaluations of the grants that we make\nI Want to invite in outside experts as well and I would want to find ways in which to organize a foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we were doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a former foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic habits of corporations were purely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often and their philanthropy\nI'm trying to stimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies or frameworks ought to govern and structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question\nWas the Stanford political scientist Robert ... we also heard from Anne Marie

choking as worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation\nAnd that's the on by luck I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\nSo I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're\nMost likely to choke I really think that any situation where there's expectations for success can cause choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure

...\nWhen psychologist think about choking under pressure they consider a variety of thought process that may be subtle and hard to measure\n... look at choking differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar\n... gave the best into view of the week\n... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that for pay you more you'll put more effort into task into second assumption is that more effort\nWill lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of cooking might be that I can push you so much to to try so hard to do will actually backfire unique perform worse\nBeen easy co authored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large steaks and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nReason we wanted to go to India is that over there are money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment\nSo we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they'd they'd perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead creative one was for example to back pieces of metal into input books in an efficient way\nSome tasks for cognitive\nAnd memory game in which I Would read up numbers and you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic throwing a dark like Ken bowls so bold a on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars and ten daughter\nWas about what they made during the month over there I opened it to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you who work much harder rights and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and the more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent of the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the middle of packing game\nUnder low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded\nUnder high incentives nobody succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might within five minutes\nThe researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as their research subjects some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you do it for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers in ...\nWhen you think about comes to stuff probably rich or Baltimore behavior to your best and very fast and now he's really really making it high incentives you might actually start being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for their keep pressing task when you increase the incentives from up to thirty dollars up to three hundred dollars they sweet for about a forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to add up numbers more cognitive one\nWe see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent [laughter] so when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into this get him to the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n\nWould seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke or probably heard from a lot of people over the years coaches teachers and counsellors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way\nThat's obviously harder than it sounds so\nHow can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble\nUnder the very circumstances that matter most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success\nUnder the very circumstances that matter most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and it leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess your buddy up on on the back and say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke\nWith we also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so rarely inoculate yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practiced taking time pass a\nYou see this with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see let's see if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium\nUm and this is true in\nReally big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it well people are watching you and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all
