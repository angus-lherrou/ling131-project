President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just fall from the skies\n\nIt's freakonomics radio show that explores banking side of everything [noise]\nHere's your house\nThe world Trade Organization was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain woods conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world bank and the Internet\nIt was founded only in Nineteen Ninety five but has its roots in Britain woods conference in Nineteen forty four which also gave rise to the world bank and the international Monetary Fund these institutions were set up to help resuscitate and grow the post war global economy\nBut the political timing wasn't right for a global trade organization instead an agreement between twenty three countries called the general agreement on tariffs and train was signed in Nineteen forty seven when the number of signatory countries reached a hundred and twenty three the agreement was formalized and given more teeth\nWith the establishment of the WTO\nIts mission is to quote ensure that trade flows smoothly predictably and freely as possible but in recent months global trade has become quite a bit less moods\nAnd much less predictable with the U.S threatening or an acting massive tariffs against a variety of countries and industries with retaliatory tariffs quickly following\nThat's where we begin the conversation with regard to as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and I was ... was that WTO headquarters in Geneva\nSo we're in a particularly noisy a trade environment at the moment it in the headlines all the time\nConsidering the threatened in actual terrorists emanating from the U.S a and considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently I'm is taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U. S.\nBut you're talking about the largest economy in the world\nSo it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with a actions taken by the United states also because an accent that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time\nHas to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies you know ... that was a a not right and then found a direction that didn't ... that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and uh if\nHe is the result of a very real a situation in American society and in the American economy and or if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis\nAnd I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single force\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that terrorists are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their governments that subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nYou the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time they industries like protection they want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seeing this I'm a prize in what we call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of or insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nTerrorists you include on your spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there measure you don't know when they come to know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nSo not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of\nNickel barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer or it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure\nA Chancellor Merkel I recently was in Japan it's all too reminiscent Robbie I'm a I've\nBeen covering a lot of ground and we've been talking and they're all\nThere is a recent news that are the leaders of Russia and China have gotten together and boosted their newfound strategic partnership I'm curious\nHow you think about um [noise] you know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists and other countries respond by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage or some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the political sensitivities in in many of these players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um\nOf course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but are they are very very Frank and uh we explore\nShare with you the listeners or the content of those conversations but are they are very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I told them about the importance of the system and not to compromise the system\nAnd I would say that pretty much everybody was talking to us tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be new going the line when others are\nComing up after the break\nWith the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask them to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nDon't worry Roberto as if they do have plenty more to say\nWe'll hear it after the break\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart a new podcast that explores the work of change makers across the country and highlights

train waters were considerably less choppy than they are today\nSo you are from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective\nEngineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a love story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic\nIn nearing like solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand\nThe basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and a figure out a way to make them work personal\nChemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that you're forever learning how to ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and themes that will be the case released another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\n[noise] this tension um that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative\nRelationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose me again or many are better off with a with a trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and uh you cannot ignore that [noise]\nThink what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before\nWeb producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for the government send for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor\nInduce structural change and I think if we don't realize that and if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\n[laughter] okay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric [noise]\nSo

I'm a professor and\nDrew reading some very inspirational economist which one was definitely Carl Marx\nMary Annette ...\nI'm a professor and the economics of innovation I'm public value at University

and also the special adviser for kind of low that should their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board for Jeremy\nAnd I resigned because of Brexit\nFears special advisor to the secretary general of the CDs that right\nYeah so the city's currently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a group\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that true yeah\nI didn't realize one of the whole and yes\nThere's actually even like thirty mark\nGoing to be that one university economist has the ear of so many governments in institutions\nFor a clue let's get back to ... months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about mark says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but\nActually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic aspect of capitalism which is technological change\nWe shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that is constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption\nWork and marks really talks about that quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it in the most dynamic kind of always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nBut it's not just technological change interest smart to cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change\nWhat do I mean by radical stance consider the titles of her

make sure you know they treat you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they show me the price you know today gentlemen or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw it turned out to be the most expensive wine that\nAnyone who read that article to call me a Soviet socialist right so\nTo someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad but someone who says that you say what\nFirst is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not free from the state\nFree from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or for I'm an active the visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the state was involved in almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of ...\nUh the state my point is actually the state was involved in almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public actors plate\nWas really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yeah\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA but also sister organization in more recent times called ARPA e the national institutes of health which continue to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nHere some evidence of the government funding that ... is talking about DARPA for the defense advanced research Projects Agency
