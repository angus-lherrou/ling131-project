Gerald Ford of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network\n\nAll the predictions the pundits have gotten wrong in recent decades one of the most compelling has to do with the city's cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back\nThe decline of urban manufacturing\nThe city itself decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city\nAs it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic and holy ... predicted rise in urban is happening here in America and all over the world [noise]\nOne problem many of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and it's not so easy to retrofit an entire city so building a new city for the twenty first century and beyond scratch\nOur mission is to use technology to really redefined urban life and the twenty first century\nToday on freakonomics radio look at the city of the future with a man who's been rebuilding New York city for the past few decades man some people call a modern day Robert Moses controversial mastered builder of decades past\nI think if somebody says\nIn meaning that they got a lot done um then I think it's a compliment I think if somebody says oh you did a lot of top down planning and [laughter]\nA lot done then I think it's a compliment I think if somebody says oh you did a lot of top down planning and you this place lots of people than it would be an insult it would also I think not be true\nAlong the way he learned central paradox successful cities all the question\nIs how do you actually manage supply and demand\nA conversation with the major league credentialed urban is Dr awesome\nSee get comfortable that's what he did oh\nI Am sitting and leaning back and looking for a car pool\n\nFreakonomics radio show that explores inside of every and\nHere's your house\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do read the name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project I'm Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nGrew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up\nThis went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York to host the Olympics and the eventual you that that idea became a bit of a movement it drew\nThe attention of Mike Bloomberg what the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less beam air which says you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way\nPresident Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal\nSmart self made fiercely pragmatic\nA spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about he was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack less than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred and eighth mayor\nBloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term spite preexisting two term limit he considered running for president he considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and do all you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today as CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nThe end Dr off was ...\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and\nYou ... the first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money a recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you\nRoland thanks to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money a recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage\nTime you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage a you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics um\nYou pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could finally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee sounds pretty nutty doesn't it you know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then it would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out the the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite a science of what kind of region will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself that we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision\nTo get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera now the second question you\nDeadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera now the second question you asked was or we better off having now

right here on a point five ...\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ... damn doctor off\nStarted his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York\nWho then joined the Bloomberg administration help New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed\nWhich Dr Ralston chairman and president\nShit I was just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you\nShed I was just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least [laughter]\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line the second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that let us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something else\nThat's exactly right it's like a transformers really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. Sony and Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters [noise]\nFrom what I can gather the shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage the big city like New York\nA great way of saying it you know another way of expressing as say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nThere is with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen\nIn the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera that enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change\nI think that is a very different notion of cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught\nYou know when I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down\nAnd the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent on ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and amenity\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because the government is really hard um and just getting anything done and often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or New Jersey city to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near cities you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because\nYou know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms and institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to or companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been the bride companies to stay or bribe companies to come uh we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world\nYou know sort of this optimistic sense that produced this incredible energy I'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYou know you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people are maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nDuring his all things considered this afternoon the five right here on ... point five to see the Atlanta you could also

from an a plus\nThey have developed the capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information that was delivered to control the pricing which products are delivered to us to control us as

more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U.S that something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated that almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern\nWe've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined we're seeing the birth of new center of power real power\nWe depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful\nAnd fascinating but they're making significant decisions you know laterally there's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days the Internet there's old is really smart\nEngineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes plus the exact combination of things that will

[noise]\nUm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books or talk about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is eliminated and I got a younger brother named Josh\nWho is a science writer who wrote a book called mood walking\nWith Einstein and it's actually\nIncredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah\nI'm sure it would in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be no for her own accomplishments right but uh you know our our parents didn't do anything\nThey didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut what are the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and it was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was at slate one of the very first mainstream online publications or just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nWas a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence

I Love\nThat I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things are good we make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the candles and incredible invention in the eye pad and yeah and the iPhone were incredible innovations and so\nAre incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention in the eye pad and yeah and I found were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic but this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist\nOregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so\nAs we entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next\nAnd I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard\nAnd co founder of Facebook\nAnd he bought the magazine and to me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media who had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back\nAnd I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship in the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen Fisher is way to get clicks was to post a clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and he slapped the headline on it and he may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right yes\nHeadline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success here so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nThat's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the reason the history of the Internet [noise] over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet to the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines and this the technologies were incredible Amazon is an incredible company has now", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "13"}
