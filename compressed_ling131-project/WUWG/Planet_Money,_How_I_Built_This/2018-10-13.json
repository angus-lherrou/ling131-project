coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of them are determined\nMaybe we should say a were you\nKnow this is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know I find you wanting to get my name is yeah [laughter]\nThat's probably the easy question I'm Catherine Rampell him at home watching\nCatherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is perfect place to show this thing that in Syria [noise]\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I can see\nDown to board\nThat on the leading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it\nWhat Katherine sees here is one price on the board\nAnd then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's bees and service charges\nThat seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet fee sometimes in the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort to buy that way anyway Catherine brought her iced tea\nInto the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompany should be competing based on price and quality and not object ... a and the fact that companies do compete on application it not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want\nEveryone has a used car salesman\nDoes not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want\nIf everyone has a used car sales [laughter]\nI have a very good friend who's a used car sales so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nYes major league baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up the game little things like limiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter and that's fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up\nThey would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nUh my name is David ... is a professor of politics at New York university do you like baseball fan a but Donna rabid fan [noise] no\nNot one who's willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose yeah\nI Know I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah like guy you want to catch up what must it on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a pro\nBaseball it works is follows that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're a bad then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand [noise]\nWe went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch ... been in place how things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games so bad and the average game\nTo prove it been in place how things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter what\nThese games are better than the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game\nWhen our most of the game yes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which he thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance so\nHow have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime [noise] well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's also\nGot a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like they're blowing up every single sport\nSo yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be the only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game Mike\nHow you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] well see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't\nGo to any baseball games anytime soon you might get thrown at you [noise]\n\nIs there a tweak that you would like to be\nYou can email it to us we're Planet Money at\nOr if she were also at Planet Money from the twitters and instead you're so his\n... marches are supervising producer Ryan or set his our\nChief episode tweezers I'm Kenny Malone and I'm there for [noise]\nAnd\nWe have one more extra special guest joining us in the studio today\nJoined introduce yourself it's me standing room lieutenant Danny Roman from the negotiator in the flash and uh you you apparently have a two week for us today do great what are you got\nNever say no to a hostage taker manual eliminate the opposite ends of the only option it leads to shoot someone understand\nNever say no to a hostage taker single manual eliminates the only option at least to shoot someone understands it gets that sort of makes sense I mean I don't\nI don't know that technically qualifies as like a week is more like a fight patronizing me ... let me turn it no uh no offense you know again I'll kill somebody or I was in um I think they were going to end this interview\nReally too bad today was just starting\nWow I never say no to a hostage taker did right now not the kind of advice I Would expect from from you've ever

company had its share of near death experiences\nOn many occasions I Would tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law to have a chance\nTo see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law's sun and Meg was calling from the house today mom don't do that what your wife\nWas telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because it sounds like she maybe she didn't believe in it well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane [noise]\nShow that

has had more ups and downs and really more downs than just about any other ... and it's pretty unlikely tail to begin with and\nTo ... hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company\nThey start small milking their own cows making their own yogurt selling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin and sliding into deep dad you know over the years Tony hill that had a slew of near death experiences\nBut it never quite died and in\nFact it grew and grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states\nAnd one thing about stony fields cofounder of Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days they were probably\nFifty shoe manufactures in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and uh so how many\nFifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so how many people did your dad's company employ\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were at twenty eight hundred while he's are true company towns of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they think because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities did as well [noise]\nWell it was really a three a free for the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my ah\nSort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a\nIt was a wake up here ... yeah I um my father a got a began drinking um [noise] and so I had to sort of confront all of that and yeah you know my mom became a single mom with five kids I was the oldest so dislike\nAnd then I went out to our lenders\nHave the hundred and twenty five gay\nI said look I'm willing to take stock in this company and we did our first private placement\nThrough a dart at the Weill figured out the value of the business what value it at the time\n[laughter] well we\nThought we were going to value it at a million dollars but then\nIn Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred and fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England\nWell by eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries were selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a an independent grocers seven stores and uh this\nWill give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night we were having dinner at the Caymans after milking and the phone rings and a Jack and to move the nephew of the owner of the militias market basket\nThey were having dinner at the Caymans after ... ...\nAnd the other phone rings and a ... the nephew of the\nOwner of the militias market basket and chained ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling them by competitive than not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time is up and said well not to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some more\nCows than he slammed the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we went out and grew are heard even further and then so we now\nRealize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed\nTo lease a small refrigerator truck and started delivering actually to the market basket warehouse how much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about Mm three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt at a case of like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court and\nSo by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed\nIn the sort of half a million dollar range but you you were\nProbably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I kept me not\nWeekly cash was not daily casualty I kept hourly castle is yeah I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out\nFrom you know send me I wasn't paying 'em so now we're on very short terms with everybody I mean my fundraising skills turn out to be you know maybe we'll be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family's unbelievable\nAttention to detail they were perfectionist but we were also we would also be nowhere without my ability to keep from getting credit and cash because it was burning I mean we were on him [noise]\nWhen we come back in just a moment

Samuel ends Tony Fields are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nThose days it's a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little free store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part a hopeless and they had one store in Cambridge on prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Melissa market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty four\nAnd um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack\nBread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the TPP would there what do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in New Hampshire to point would you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth\nOh you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] what you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old\nUltimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yoga and that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nOr getting all kinds of requests for yoga candidate when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivery that afternoon I'm about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt so\nShe took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles is last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get people's miles and then they're going to ask\nFor it and run around the time you meet Maggie would become your wife right yeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus and we had our summer no sometimes\nNortheast organic farming association conference in I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very adorable\nOr organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there a waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg\nAnd her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state so she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later said well I think we can increase since she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money for friends and family money mhm 'cause they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some harbored MBA with with with a tie\nYou know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful oh yeah you know what happened\nIn this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAnd by this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so I'm thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would\nOn many occasions tiptoe over to the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law signed and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo that what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well 'cause she didn't have confidence and then they will look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out the ...\nThe power would I mean we're in the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was make things do you listen to ditch the thing that's bag it I mean or or did you eat because it sounds like maybe he didn't believe in it [noise]\nWell she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in and did you think that means you are you are what two three years into this thing and not only are you making money you are\nIn debt that big time yeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more forcefully probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\nYou know she had given up her job done in her farm in New
