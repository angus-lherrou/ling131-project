couple of things to know about Tommy Noonan he lives in Reno nevada he likes to juggle weird things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and they'll have like an avocado and de onion and or a bottle of water\nThat's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah the story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews against around two thousand six Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nYeah yeah the story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews against around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds Monday Tommy was hanging out with a friend but he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um\nGot it so you got to Amazon and keep putting iPhone cables [noise] um yes so we had ... over twenty thousand ... stats allowed you were the\nAnxiety starts so we're going to click on the one that we like All right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into vehement okay and then I hit my report and events that were part right and it's a show\nComputing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever it's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flag about these iPhone cable reviews of him\nSo for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average these\nReviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average view is way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nAfter them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example\nDoes that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo younger them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the courts do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you should see that and more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews to\nAn end in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means with seven people feel that way [laughter] well seven\nPeople also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect there is the correct for hours [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software random about a dozen different tests center iPhone cable reviews and his reports it out and adjusted invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and he adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after Ken reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they leave you say actually the scandals that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm so like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop we of\nCourse reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they sent us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admits that they do not have the fifty states you could do this when I was like a non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm where have you made it itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even said with high confidence whether a review with fake according to an\nAmazon thing it's not necessarily different from what time he told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural fire Amazon that as a problem\nWe have hundreds of millions of views on Amazon and of that total less than one percent or an authentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own\nOn that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and all of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\n[noise] so it's complicated right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time where there was just too many fake they'd be sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up\nOn the Internet shopping and we'll go back to France\nFrance should [laughter] we will go back to Iran from Brenda right [laughter] well there is a point where it's just

people could hang out for a long time maybe even have a PTA meeting or social gathering in really linger over that bagel or ... soup\nAnd this is the famous third place concept that both Howard Schultz and rom shake wanted to tap into and that kept ... became one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in the world in fact if you invested the seven thousand dollars in Paris stock in Nineteen Ninety nine\nYou'd be sitting on more than half a million dollars by two thousand Seventeen\nNow the thing is if you met Ron shake say in high school this is not the pad and you'd have predicted foreign wasn't even interested in business his passion was politics as parents were raging liberals and Ron grew up going to rallies and volunteering on campaigns all over New Jersey [noise]\nEventually went to Clark University where naturally he majored in politics\nIt was a mess you know we didn't have a way we were making Spanish west side we buy the spinach frozen we didn't have a way to to get rid of the water and somebody came up with the idea well let's let's buy\nA dozen dryers like hair dryers are no clothes dryer San Francisco but but the Spanish and the clothes dryer and um that will dissipate the water from from\nYou know I was like well that was a great idea frozen spinach into clothes dryer and what we let it prospered\nWe've put frosted spit inching enclosed dryers letting it run off the water was a great idea until one day we blew the top off the or the drier and ended up with the spin engine in all three\nLetting it run off the water was a

and this is ex Vietnam veterans tattoos all over his body working in the bakery comes over and starts to do mouth to mouth resuscitation on the pounding on his chest and then all of a sudden this guy

about Ron shake and the story of how he eventually build an Arab red is just how\nMany times along the way he sees new opportunities or best to improvise adapt again and again and again\nRon comes to a point where he has to make a big pivot and transformed his business and in Nineteen eighty five three years after Iran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called old won't pan a business that's really struggling\nHe manages to turn things around with his partner Luke came but it's still a small business in fact Ron himself\nWorks at the sales counter during the day\nLike doing that actually helps them figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nChief duty for Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant working [noise] and I'd have a customer walk up to me going and what I have a baguette I'd say sure and they say slice it cut hands and the ... and they call out of ... from the local\nFor a walk up to ... and what I have that back again I'd say sure and they say slice it I'd have them do both and they pull out a bag from the local\nSupermarket from a local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe oh she's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard NBA to say wow\nThe real thing here is that the bank act is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the purse French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston he decided to you we're going to make\nThis a new experience I knew from Penn experience where people could come and eat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery two bakery cafe right and almost instantly fist broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you serving there\nWe were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our Britain course on what they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey every cheese and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we have the language for back then but what the big recap I was [noise] was an altar of between down and dirty fast food yeah and find yeah men for\nPeople who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to cough fashion casual\nThis was an attempt to do something that was better but then a quick service mode\nSo once you know surf stones idea of creating cafes and bakeries it was up to the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were\nGoing to begin a pretty rapid expansion well ... ... you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe\nWe saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one in French crickets and we found we developed big competitors [noise] All right so something if something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is\nAmong panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based\nSomething something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long ten acquires this a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy a dislike small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ...\n[noise] no I you know I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from\nThat I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis Britain company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis doing ... almost as much as we did with old bones pet but doing so in suburban St Louis and it\nStruck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis for a company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while old bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis bread company or did you initially did you immediately ... you're going to rename this thing\nWe rename than concept [noise]\nAn air bread in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it their bread because as we went to new markets people often thought from St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses now than it is with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight ... you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond the original Nineteen yeah by Nineteen Ninety eight\nWe roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was
