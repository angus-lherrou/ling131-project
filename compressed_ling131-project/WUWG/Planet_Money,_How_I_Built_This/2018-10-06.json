Fitch and he says the government could not just released a flood of surplus cheese onto the market because it would crush she's producers\nYou can imagine the the cheese company that's when the business selling trees is going to say what's the deal here you took away my customers is important to me\nThis leaves a couple of options you could destroy the surplus but that looks pretty bad\nOr you can try to get your surplus goods to people who are not going to buy it anyway and that you won't be flooding anyone's markets\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered milk we can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid but she's just\nDoesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese the way through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like brick and\nIs what people will remember as a government cheese when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nAnd this is what people will remember as government cheese when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThing great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities which needy people lined up to get the surplus this\nFootage one hundred is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed the bricks that or she is and it's on the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on it and\nHe's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people and get a taste of today's to\nThis moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the cave full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military medals\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nOf any government cheese\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz\nClear the government chief from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nWe bought\nGet we get a like a blood in them wouldn't be something that she\nMay be government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with\nWould change his government\nShe became a symbol of a crappy government handout tend to be fair was process cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're here to them but I'm not running down bell veto but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with ...\nTastes like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThat is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better\nParents doing the dance ... doing the\nDance strain but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nMama by the way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\n[noise] well I think there's there's a two basic lessons again economist Andy ... which one is\nIt's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically sucking the lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese [laughter] I mean that\nWas the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it costs for that I'm very very expensive\nShe's been to the government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nAnd the thing about price controls it once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked the economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was to gently get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally\nAn unnatural amount of smell one part of the solution then was to gently get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like have people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... Bush told and we've created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk ... mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk moustache is\nQuite a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese of pollution that is until last July the White House\nIs coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump diminished ration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs for the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learned some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distribute it to places like\nSchools and food banks got to be fair [noise] that's probably not enough to start selling caves which again but there is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government cheese Kay [noise]\nSo it was produced by electing ...\nThey found in hand reign of going back to providing producer is Alex ... mark ... editor is Brian hers that\nKaren Duffin I'm Kenny Malone\nOkay ride was coming up next on your show today I've had built this really mad at the guy who founded this company which I'm\nI have heard of it yeah I see him\nThey are today on how I built this really mad at the guy who founded the shoe company which\nI have heard of it yeah I see his shoe everywhere right but even when\nHe was a household name Steve Madden why isn't convinced that he made the cut I'm not one of those odd to print or is that thought he was going to be super successful you know I was just trying to survive and I'm very negative very pessimistic\nUnlike maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the shows yet total I'm sure they got that you know that they're going to be I'm thinking gave me down to me I think I've gone out of business every other day [noise]\nBuilt that show that innovators entrepreneur Taylor\nOn guy riding on today's show\nAnd design them low in prices\nAttorney's name three billion dollars ...\nAll right so you've got this pretty good business going in year one what do you think you know you're thinking okay I mean did you have ... at that point all ready to make this into something he'll\nSo when I ... I started the business and geologist but really don't have much money I'm just sort of working hand to mouth and a friend of mine who I grew up with went to work for this brokerage firm and they were raising money for small companies just says Donnie ... Danny ... yeah\nAnd uh you know we're going to raise you were going to get you\nWill raise you six hundred grand and to and he said to you hey you need to expand your line really talented I've known you my whole life you know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know hundred thousand was like six hundred million to me and then he said well not only will I get you\nLife you know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know hundred thousand was like six hundred million to me yeah and then he said well not only will I get your six hundred grand but I'm going to get your six million dollars when I take your job\nAnd I laugh get him you know because I thought he had thirty thousand\nDollars in my to my ... and so of course you're like what thirty three thirty something like that yeah and you're thinking we could raise me six hundred thousand bucks that's right so the right and so so so Danny ... help you go yeah and he helped make up public in his bottom\nWas called strap no mine a very famous saying for anybody who's seen it will do for Wall Street did [noise]\nIs Jordan fell for the year I turned twenty six I'm forty nine million dollars would\nFive million a week\nShe should explains friend of mine was just like a cul de dum dum for they used to call them ... and they were basically hell he would tell really crappy companies they would ... get checked up later so all the shares make tons of money I Would lose their stress and so they\nBasically were wanting to do this with Steve Martin right they want it to do it with Steve Martin the perfect guy for them because because you know I had a company and it was small and they could do their thing with it you know it fit the profile\nThough if\nYou don't know me ah\nOn the bar scene and\nWith me talking in front of the ... it was very accurate we should explain the scene where people haven't seen it you you go up in front of all these um these like traitors and this ... year I started talking about my shoes thinking that they would really be interested OK really weren't I was just a piece of it was just a piece of paper and a piece of meat marry they could sell it\nI Want to just to digress for [noise] for people\nWith budding entrepreneur is I'm not one of those entrepreneur is that thought he was going to be super successful you know I was just trying to survive and I'm very negative very pessimistic on like maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the shows yet total I'm sure they got that you know they're going to be I mean can get me down to me I think I'm going out of business every other day\nThe strengthened sail goes the company goes public ... public yeah all of a sudden it raises\nMe and I think I'm going out of business every other day\n... go to the company goes public ... public yeah all of a sudden it raises how much money for you I think the public offering was about seven million bucks wow so\nWe use it I I took it and in very short period of time from a half a million bucks I was doing forty million a year fifty million and what did that money there within thirty six months\nIncredible so okay you get all this cash from from the initial public offering yeah\nA ... and it's coming to ditch you ask any questions I mean these guys were uh they were totally breaking the law I mean there at that point they were artificially inflate in your stocks did you\nLike where you suspicious at all about Danny and about Stratton they didn't did you did you think hey you know one of these guys do it\nI knew it was too good to be true yeah I Know so I was greedy and foolish\nFrom trying to figure out you are just creative guy create choose you design issues\nAnd you've got a really successful and grilling business and then on the side you're doing this these weird stock trades that you are shady and ... ultimately ... illegal why would you even do that stuff on the side you know already had the creativity to now because you just [noise]\nYou just get caught up\n[noise] but it is a certain point it can't be about money it has to be about fulfillment and\nYou fulfilled by just the creation of your shoes and and senior shoes out in the world [noise]\nThat's a very heavy question\nOne gets fulfilled [noise]\nWe're still grappling with that today you know so there are moments\nWhere I'm very fulfilled you know and there are moments when I'm not I was raised to think that money was everything you know money is the center of the universe\nAnd if that's what your core beliefs is you know you'll do anything and you\nBreak the law you know second money like a drug\nAs the Madden pays band\nAs the Madden pays and pays hard for his crimes\nAnd eventually he comes back to the company
