the houses appear to be deserted\nVery few lights are on um gas stations are indeed opened there are lines but earlier\nBut kind of harried jammed crush that's just not there I also saw earth movers for the first time at the rama yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall that was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Rob and there is no mass government mobilization\nOne week later that is absent this is a do it yourself affair of full of good Samaritans\nYeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes in buckled roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and\nYou know you you take it in with personal stories of people\nTo take it in with the man who sits and describes to you and he's with a far off looking as I um this complete conflict that he has inside his himself said he ... that that he survived but at what cost\nShe kept saying things like it you you may think we were selfish when we just ran\nUm because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left a father behind he said he was he was praying in his house he said we had seconds to to get out um and they were luckily on the street he looked up terms or saw wall of water coming at them\nAnd just ran its you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous and miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building

the equipment here to do it yet\nAnd that is part of the mystery of this place I mean it's really not known how many people perished\n[noise] we know a French rescuers were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're thinking that that might have been a gas leak or something that they the there is no life there but you mentioned the lack of coordinated government response\nSo long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water\nThey don't have food they don't have

at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen and joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHow you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest\nThe mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid representing the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nCalling senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the land where people Obamacare because it would hurt Nevada Dean Heller is a no\nYou're right now I Can't support that we shouldn't be the most Americans [noise] but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there to be held her\nJust promise and voted for repeal deciding to stir how how\nBig of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making a quite a mark here you know this was the vote about about a year ago maybe a little bit more\nHeller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you've probably ought to tell people why\nJust for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue [noise] what\nAbout Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver\nTelling me what you're going to do and just doing\nThe hell are getting things done already pieces of legislation to help veterans\nLegislation\nInteresting to know that all the people speaking that had are women yeah that really really does stand out\nLook I I don't trust falls but by the latest CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jackie Rosen by fourteenth points over hell are fifty two to thirty percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women [noise] what else do\nWe know about ... other than the fact that he's sort of straddling between ... supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally [noise]\nYeah that's really the the kind of become the central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste sight in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste ah for the country [noise]\nUh the health care issue he seemed ... reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire uh got

like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect that Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this show that features these people were supposed to be top journalist\nSo of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown\nAnd because he's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state to actually make an appearance on this show so we've got a clip of that uh let's let's let's say\nAnd I also assume you've had previous secretary always theory absolutely for four years I was the secretary\nSecretary has a very large organization\nHave the skills computer male female [noise]\nI Do have some experience with [noise]\nAlways makes you wonder is running as nothing again I get out\n[laughter] no I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails editor right um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was a she is also appeared in a an episode of Madam Secretary that trauma um alongside Colin Powell and I'm I'm a ... and uh other political so\nI'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump ism the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back against some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitor shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nSteady original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real\nAgainst the monitor shape with a GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nSteady original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life meets fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential\nElection Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown for having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quilt criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\n[noise] yeah there there's a\nA there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets in them responding to him I think we have\nA good time you were [noise]\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivery of the effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival I I didn't I found\nSome of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech defined by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a ...\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like it kind of wish to show 'em ... these people making a kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweeted them\nA while it was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of this show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that have been saying things like this for so long on TV including most of the late night comedians that we have you know Stephen ... Jimmy Kimmel and\nYou know that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nIs so different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and they weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times well what about\nThe idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was\nSo the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was there before\nYeah I'm In a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots\nI'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stories and Boris politics\nUm there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that uh fans had kind of missed it and and ... will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slap living near the show a over it so\nI'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't minutes syndication for a long time so ah you know I don't think a lot of younger people leave a familiar with the show and because the the the ... version of it\nI'm Still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nTo NPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow but the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh\nHas prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most have changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexander less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes\nReally bad memories come up Alexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties they called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women\nJohn Paul free is head of school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nWhatever amount is right for you as a write free for us we are looking to hear from you listeners have turned to public radio as a source for news for years over the decades the world has grown more complex but there are some important things about public radio that have\nNot changed like the idea that thoughtful quality journalism can create a more informed public whether you've only recently started listening or you've been listening your whole life TPP dot org or eight hundred to two to four seven eight\nThat's eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight or G.

nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nBy creating a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Jeremy well let's start with a number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today as\nYou mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough months\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's yeah most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\nAbsolutely and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten or ... the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment when we were ...\nThe the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get jobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where\nThe issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict go to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting\nBecause the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's it by all accounts of very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages [noise]\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about it overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you factor\nIn Tempe is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and this John Connelly also came out the his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIs supposed to be a Democrat stay very big surprise\nDid that surprise you hit the Republican Jim how you doing when he's facing the Democrat Dan ... those are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nHe's facing the Democrat Dan ... both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn for this week's district profile cast and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and cats are in Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen but the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\n[laughter] well it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are started the city had\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six came when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time right well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat\nDan the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and industries that he built himself as an independent voice\nYou can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment Bruce ... what's the harm\nTo the point that means nothing\nLeader corporation\nOr cats or Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the district to run [laughter]\nUm I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWill not at the Republican Jim ... in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington ... ... or so certain Rosen a Trump pulling them\nWith their health and the regulations bomber chair\nCatherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's this on on that well he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on this\nCatherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump puts us on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and ... is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Finn he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats or I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really did stuff for Minnesota Senator Al Franken for in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior\nBaby that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the of the accusations we've\nBeen hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics\nThat would the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he\nLeft office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that and this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether I'm he is taking responsibility for his actions", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "05"}
