his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nBen Bradlee junior welcome to here and now\nThat you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\n[noise] this is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre um it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time [noise]\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them [noise] well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host\nAnd learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person or we do to another I ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on twelve or who stories\nI decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nYou talk to a number of people who are kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you'd you'd dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related will speak like huge big league or big league may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes\nRelate a bull speak like huge big league or big league may have turned up voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earn county [noise] but I think people\nBase most of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a ... generally like Trump on most issues [noise] but I really liked his style they just like to say is moxie his feisty and that's how he gets up every morning and um that has a tweet storm\nAnd I'm six it to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward than that he was talking down to them no on the contrary\nThey felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah but interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you're really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump still\nCatholic done majority so this is a rising evangelical population Trump's um\nStill predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population\nTrump's evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion and his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty eight team this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county [noise]\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict the ripple effect is a more widespread and or the county coroner [noise]\nAnd down there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness\nAbout it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving this brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and a boy working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\n[noise] maybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nThere with the individual mandate has been repealed but\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nThere with the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first eight years\nGoing up the budget filed in February ... shows a seven trillion dollar increase so Republican Party doesn't seem to care\nAbout what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to\nDo they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's a personality over or anything else [noise]\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump

little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to groups so few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe cast and\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in our predominantly white school that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school ended the policy question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of spelling in college and historically black college for women\nThat ... the director of the little at school has said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise]\nUm I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful [noise] talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter calls wire all the black kids sitting together and the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter calls why are all the black kids sitting together and the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\nOne of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not\nA bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on\nThem and so they might develop some oppositional behavior slain that sure well if I Am a young\nAfrican American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person and a white dominated society one of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that the honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like than you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower tracks maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher attracted a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation we'd end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability\nThe result in re segregation we'd end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings perhaps\nBecause they are less well prepared\nAnd maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper tracks and you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing they'd have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white school\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs\nLook at the performance of the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not um echo but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white\nAnd the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly yeah you have things like that going onto unintentional yes\nI mean that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in a school yeah but there was a ...\nWell intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong to that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved and uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nUm the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways [noise]\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together and the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\n[laughter] film I moved from a large software to re why does a billboard map what forms we've ever were on the radio

welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story seems that we that are now in our minds\nYou write a tidbit I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets napping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say\nAlthough I Love the ballets and I am championing none of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius\nIn that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer I think it will\nBe fabulous well start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial of

here now done or what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got to the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live\nPianist over on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial court lead friendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance use thirty dancers and all and it had the\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of down to say [noise] had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because it was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nTheir bridge out excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes she called it Ninety minutes of hard

minutes after he was elected in November twenty six team\nAt the appropriate time I will ... like right now I Wonder who came out and nobody cares deal like here's is you know you and a few people that have some questions\nObviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI call on the German away from age just stopped delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans as being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law in taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHi Jeremy [noise] so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress could require as the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's her ...\nA upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner [noise] um but it can important agents such as a staffer outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee it would probably be very wise for the house the full house\nSignificance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees connect unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWhile I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation to submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote their committee would would resolve to do this\nNow again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is the tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father and there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest that New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story [noise]\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that\nIssues about potential conflicts of interest but New York times also raises the possibility of fraud and that story [noise]\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it's searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOr the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed at that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal long it's where they were\nCarrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal\nInvolving some high level executive branch officials are the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the press in it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply a retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge administrators from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration pushed through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues there well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going\nHere and there were issues of well\nHow would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly\nJust as the executive branch already had [noise]\nDo you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see [noise]\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest can their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first dude filed returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax but\nPresident Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it it it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law\nBut I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
