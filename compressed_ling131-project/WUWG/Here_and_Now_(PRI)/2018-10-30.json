German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which ah reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where in they reside so how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\n[noise] very good question though um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but as the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms [noise]\nThat's a pretty high legal hurdle to decline when something is in

said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who was an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national their home country they're claiming that people

Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nOr ... or ... or ... or ... remember short term interest rates and\nThat's what the market sulfur store for turned your treasury milk and sugar\nWhich remember a short term interest rates and\nThat's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThey impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the and back to the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America history which he co authored with Adrian will drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWe have more than two\nIt's more directly related to\nStructure of economy for example the so called rust belt\nIs populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of who very you know\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation threw out the country of Tibetans obviously whether to run for re in areas where as sort of been prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices a little one everyone talks about the one thing about this country which is very diverse\nHundreds of times where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of the new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWhen you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nBasically because\nYou know when you deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence\nIs basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book insulin I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook as well\nUh just inclination to take risks\nAnd the book insulin I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook is all about how we say that the issue the aging of the population\nHas consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nOn gradually and inexorably driving our gross domestic savings and the economy dollar for dollar\nUh so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit\nWe're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nWhat this is causing this there's largely the demographic issue\nThat the population is aging right now the official actuaries other Social Security system\nSay in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance\nBenefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFor civil drugs that gets going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation has the major problem out\nSo long as you're don't do it is a good cause the debt overall total government that over a rise indefinitely\nAnd that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation is a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates since ... century bc Greece but not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that\nInterest rates will rise if for no other reason that the below the long term human nature determined stability\nDo you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we should've rates low\nPoint employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace\nFor the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move\nIs that we didn't see ... ... ... signals and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling\nBelow a brief usual expectation\nWith ... to the rousing as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh\nThey're not ... kept falling below four percent was the no impact on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that\nWhat we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand noted [noise] 'cause there are two conditions are hard for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic asset live\nSecure drugstore mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages are financed\nWasn't there for them to\n...

it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve per kid breaks down\nDuring the period of very low\nWith I was more the period was\nWas having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that ... one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation\nHire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that data is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nBasically it's it's not lower productivity\nBut it's the issue\nWhen you get to sort of tight labor market\nRates begin to rise of necessity\nAnd it's the wage rate rises which\nThe cost of production\nHence induce corporations to start raising prices\nBasically because the costs are going up patch where the problem\nHasn't really been growing up [noise]\nI

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers ... what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill says\nWell this is really sad day in the neighborhood um I Know that I'm afraid in July ... the community that diverse diversity in the community and squirrel hell\nAnd um he loves walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and a godsend churches\nUm that own made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yeah the scent Hebrew and it doesn't have the language is spoken and he walked down the street at community\nHe actually learn ...\nIt's actually criteria decent Hebrew and it doesn't have the language is spoken to walk down the street community he actually learn ...\nThey did get where do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\n[noise] um\nThey're not just neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of ... neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood and ... make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd ... seconds electro community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nThat word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nIs that the nation me\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it means\nMeans\nGetting killed\nSort of surprised way what happened you know killed that every man\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now\nMany people are talking about a\nAbout it you know\nI'd rather talk about some other day\nHe\nSet sound a courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers as he doesn't feel like a picnic or as she says that's okay\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh [noise]\nI think one of the things that you got a call\nAll the emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh [noise]\nI think one of the things that he taught us all lift that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone for children the message was that\nA grownup for there to listen and I think that the message to grim now we're\nListening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the help her stay the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses every one\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who are cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers [noise]\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence little some\nBeen terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing races\nCleaned for your protection\nSupport\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nVery young child to say\nWithout a mean overwhelming [noise] what\nDo you think for Ed Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nIt it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFor ... said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend [noise]\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would\nDo would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions to the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um\nYou are listening to here and now an

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch or against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed [noise]\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminal\nOr for your child I mean we're not going to let out for their first it's my turn outrage minor and they get out it's my turn on your ... going to get a shot out or if it's like\nOK here's Cordray getting a word and\nAre the worst Steve in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports that we have the highest increase in November of last year and he stays in the nation sorry [laughter] so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for for anything that will change\nSince ... last year and he stays in the nation sorry [laughter] so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis Fisher\nIs we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people\nWho have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind but the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters or we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either\nThis year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly now we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I had some effect on\nThat's showing goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning a plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us now says Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nA lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nSaying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going\nYou could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that is happening in my mind goes to a a crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes\nThere's a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that health related flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nYou're listening to hearing down [noise]\n\nSupport for G.
