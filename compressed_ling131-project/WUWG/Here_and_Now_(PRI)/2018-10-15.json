forced to have an auto\nThis year and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predicts just tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do\nPolitics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways yeah\nUh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race bat uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts and saying please tell me what's gonna happen next\nOne the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that got it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong you know ... ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters and one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other domains [noise] is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other domains that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIs the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's going to happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nAll of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\n[noise] this is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nAh there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe\nI'm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask yourself is this person just trying to get me the straight good to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory [noise]\nI always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with the population bomb by Paul Ehrlich there was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mask global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise]\nUm well it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong [noise]\nI can tell you from experience the people kinda yawn because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThe forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because there and tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often it's heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen you\nUp and you know look it's a there's an old saying about mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat saying gardener who is author of the book future babble and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here now dot org\nNow to the environmental fallout from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the

Trump said he spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia\nRegime denied any knowledge of it\nYou didn't really know maybe I don't want to get by but these are sort of the world you know\nPresident Trump also said he's sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia let's kick off the week ahead in politics with NPR lead political editor demand ... now identical good a good morning or afternoon we'll start with the missing Saudi journalist the president picking up on a theory that your colleague NPR's Jackie Northam\nTold us is popular in Saudi Arabia this was broke killers\nBut in a consulate you know even Republican lawmakers want punishment that the president seems unwilling to carry out in blocking an arms deal when\nWhat do you what's your sense of what's going to happen here\n[noise] well it certainly complicated geopolitically was president he seems to have real himself pretty plainly as somebody who wants to talk about you know specific transactions are very transactional person this is the way he was with his real estate deals and the thing that kept coming up for President Trump\nWas the fact the last night on sixty minutes that\nHe said look they we get billions of dollars in a you know these weapons sales and he doesn't want to hurt jobs when it comes to re fi on or any of the other uh ours maker\nSmile and and as others have said these aren't really commitments for sales are more like promissory notes it you know they they may not happen anyway but and some of the most us did happen under the Obama administration but you mentioned the sixty minutes interview he was also asked about that die report from the inter governmental agencies are\nClaiming that a climate change is real and time is running out to do something about it\nThe president said he's not denying that climate change exists but that it could change back and that people say the storms or as we just saw it with hurricane\nThe president said he's not denying that kind of change exists but that it could change back and then people say that storms as we just saw it with hurricane Michael were worse years ago let's listen to this conversation with Leslie stall\nThey say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just said with Michael says that they say they say that in the ... what about scientists who say it's worse than ever\nSupport for CPB comes from you our listeners and Ogle Thorpe University in Brookhaven working to make a private college education possible for more families in Georgia complete information on their new flagship fifty program is available at ... dot E.

happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um [noise]\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nWell others are pushing forward in fact they're fighting there saying that fighting climate change can be job producing and that we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change there's just about a decade left\nTo take unprecedented action to reduce to reduce the extreme impacts of climate change\nThe report recommends reducing current emissions being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already out there what's known as negative and missions so let's take a look with Gregory ... a professor of public affairs and environmental studies at the last ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the carbon dioxide out of the areas plants right because they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take the two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove billions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing in all of these\nUh schemes to remove the uh to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that land that potentially could have been done something else with\nAnd and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with if it's if that's something else as growing food um that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects even things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nAnd also we know that trees only started cutting for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] you know there was a permanent issue with a story in the ... too and\nI'm In trees that I'm not such an issue for storing it underground for example\nDon't listen to some of the other ideas kind of capture storage what are some of the ideas here\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid the will to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions or the way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy it takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops in a power plant and instead of putting that suit to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use the stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could a Korean food security issues which is something we want to avoid one\nAnd by the way I just said Steven thinkers curious akin to knock it as a new book a night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yeah we're going to come along but\nAbout the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technology that we aren't you know we don't even have yeah we're going to come along but we're not just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the ... to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the ideas could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to that's in the air\nCapture that seem to compress it and then store underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nThat almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a primitive Lee expensive so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes crime\nOr actually sway started up and they say the concept between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kind of fear to capture I'm getting another company in Canada can protect crochet fifty per metric can fix Pakistan\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to\nOver the whole world now I think the number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then the ... you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about those technologies is the concept come down so as you say claim works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of see what to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of C. O. two\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada that has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat that uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with cost it seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the lemon juice impacts\nAnd with costs it seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have a lemon juice impacts\nOne of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of CEO to by mid century um and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned\nThat's it for the whole world in terms of commercial director capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to\nSomething like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] [laughter] well um you get the investors excited about that [laughter]\nYou know that that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes set the more speculative and this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up C. O. two was weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve more CEO to either water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis by plankton and again ... the atmosphere in different ways where do you say though\nTo how her tag I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in effect that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing the of two emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah yeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes\nCalled a ... term for it as moral hazard this idea that\nIf you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't produce the missions uh enough [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "15"}
