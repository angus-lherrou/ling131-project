the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent\nDemocratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably is most progressive he supports\nHiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system will have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need\nA con sort of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs and others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however\nIs to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republican Senate refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to healthcare you said you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that's right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who was also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nOn his Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime my city\nSaid to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's in\nTallahassee is the eighth largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate the missile defenses described how community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's eight clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what is the middle east do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we'd Institute or restore to justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law this uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality\nI Want to see that President Trump down in your debate with Ron dissent is knew he was just too much for the president he made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his Ruth is with the leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nIn terms polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nI'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do it\nUh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals referring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd Mr disasters is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran just said\nAll the Jews but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of get a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nDoes ... says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and Alison money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the things that this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with a take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail\nGovernor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct\nAnd the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars I'm\nGonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to sell reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm\nTripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the of Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new car she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrate going into our groundwater\nWhen we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to\nBut a protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nAnd we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes but in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida there again thanks so much for speaking to us\nOf course to take care part of our\nTalk with Andrew

exciting races to watch who talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump and a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing\nHe had the Democrats and\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson as luckily not let's convene are

closer to you I mean your status I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU I Ryan hey Robin from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said has been sending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it\nAnd his race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said has been sending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it hard for this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum responds awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies and the story but I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers questions\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nUm ... democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissent is on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president ... minutes straight and Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which has been a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on him painting Donald Trump\nI don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying or\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being just saying this was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate well\nEnrique as if they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this as he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to have like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border to kill December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's\nResonating where you are in Miami\nTank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm\nReally see the impact all the coverage and all the attention described and has had in the last couple of days and then they will have a in the run up to your mid term election will see that on ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that a reporter was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states and the last ... made got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were except in into the country so that there is that but I just [noise]\nOr then that made you got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so that there is that but I just just to underscore this every day we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida is a great example Robin you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr someone just state in two thousand sixteen now you're Puerto Rican so many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the ... over the new ... have seems ah coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and just the Latino communities ... come in at different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling uh shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nWalker Nelson\nLike high taxes [noise] um [noise]\nAndrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nThere and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher tax higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd here senator Nelson responding\nSoil for governor
