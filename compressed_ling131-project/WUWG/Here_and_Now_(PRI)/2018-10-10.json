shooter in an area that\nWas December second twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie ... who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at her home where she showed us some of them into she received during her recovery including a story of hope from one of her nurses\nThings get me to death and nice people\nEvery time he runs marathons he saved them some people call [noise] so [noise]\nIt can graduations and loyalty or 'cause I got an award is a day\n[noise] and God Bless keep running\nWe've been following her recovery ever since ... recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over and Julie ... joins us to talk about it ... it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over it because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just a quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical [noise]\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am a responsible for all my medical care from here on ... and ... how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it says it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind\nAnd seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct but our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county um even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing\n[noise] but now you have started taking classes in graphic design a you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking my dogs in exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area are you doing physically after all those surgeries [noise]\nI think I'm doing better now\nI'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start from our interview originally you had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police and he got a hold of me\nAnd we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the from the ...\nDairy healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nSo great and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings [noise]\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement maley how they can improve their responses for the victims side [noise] I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that but just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\n[noise] I recently met a I'm a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who\nRun into the building to help save people during the shooting and after I found out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know do do I thank him do I say a great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWater those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice I think they expect to see\nCan't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened it's not\nNow I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done that it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um more maybe I don't know natural\nOr it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\n[noise] there have been so many other shootings since we last spoke as have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for Cape PCC Hi Mary hey there\nSo let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of the state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influences Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be unaffordable for a lot of people uh Scott knew some has a big leap\nCan't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving sounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be on affordable for a lot of people uh Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him or the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking they are now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when he has to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats\nAnd so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd take a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are couple areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood\nAnd during the recession the funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ad that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump but the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nSo I think that what it's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property\nAre way way out of whack\nTo move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meaning if you don't have this kind of wall\nGrew in California can do it\nJust got a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year\nScott a\nThere are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWhile in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nAre their problem and he's really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races and you know there are just issues and affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference voters\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nLet's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the cabinet or\nHearing she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to do\nThe challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media are paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo ah and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know it's I haven't seen\nBroadway but one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he listened to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nFive things that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to ah to California to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is for scientists actually for a younger voters here in California\nAnd daily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know we ... bind or rewind back to twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California and many of them are young people

V.\nThe corruption of government distrust in government and why the second generation\nGoing more democratic [noise] I think because of the American values the lottery is Korean Americans that grew up in second generation uh tend to grow up in an urban areas\nAnd I think that's part of the process in urban areas tend to\nFocus more progressive thinking\nAnd more of the conservative suburban ideal ...\nSays one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is the immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nThe thought of eliminating that because a lot of my relatives came here through chain migration so the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump the matter what they believe they came here legally\nOr a majority of them\nAnd they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my\nFriends I mean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republican or so\nHave definitely some qualms about that key issues\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like tan and sunny new and we met them at a cafe sending owns it in orange county neighborhood called Saigon and he told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I and I think you know you do get generation one which is our parents and and I we we're one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nWe were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the difference\nBut it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it starts to finish\nAnd not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so freaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government\nSo stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of all digital family show when they\nSay you know what you don't want to say\nWe have our own strategy that we don't want to share a best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations they're known\nTo be very fragmented\nRight and you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and [noise]\nAnd being an American or\nYou know and having it includes city I think that's one of our reasons why we have grown because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em or Christian parents said look we work closely with the city we're sharing best practices are sleep sharing best practices that entrepreneur\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to watch together and that's one of the big difference from generation one\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county it's fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nMy family came to this country we came late on me\nWe want to be out the kidney America provided to see it on our\nOwn young mom raised by the sea register for her consistent record opposing tax increases and waiting for fiscal responsibility\nYoung Kim for Congress there hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex Kim\nYong Kim of course locally here with him and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related\nAt all you still cameras are very popular name a Korean American Muslim or figure quarter of us are occurring victims including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because his more not just about ... about also this next and this is a definite connection and having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter the general Republicans I Would like to see a Korean American older than\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Pam knew when\nI started a business owner of the leading cause of the ... American first before being part of a party though Republican or Democrat\nThan to marry in food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace and education\nAnd how's the Asian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from our where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages did speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish I'm and I'm you know my family's been here for so long that\nIt's it's those types of questions we always get it and so it makes people feel that\nThey're not really accepted or they're not really American [noise] so what do you think that means for the upcoming election [noise]\nI think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice but also how important it is to educate a the general public about the issues that we find are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "10"}
