think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from both parties but it also has to go down to that our representatives in Washington are men governors

people trying to get on and it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together\nSecret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise]\nMy experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing [noise]\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's back it and finally O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things that is a\nQuote from Jay and cuts say from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named

first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lower like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know we can't explain to them oh the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dog to sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating to me and then he did more afterwards\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs hands because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's a whole chapter is where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something he's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking\nThere she has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning [noise] she doesn't do much besides take care of that was a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody else where the party are near the woman who is in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and\nPeter ... is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow [noise] along the way I I I kept thinking I should ... should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight and they all wanted atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic Lee they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um but he's a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does have seemed to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who weren't dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [laughter] soy could be boats\nOr maybe the friend is the narrator\nNow and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married or she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like\nShe says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats to dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says there almost two poignant and their relations with the person that short cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me [noise]\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNow dogs can be unbearably poignant she said although remind you of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat with trying to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's [laughter] that's very moving\nWell and so was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for those who want to wrestle a story to the ground\nA piece of advice that I really like is the symbols

second leading cause of death the Americans in twenty sixteen the car accidents Glenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that pushed for this law for years and tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm In diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching\nIn upstate New York so we wanted to make sure that you know each district could determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban areas in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island\nMay have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out but a small town in upstate New York shortly may not be as widely used\nAnd there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has the taken into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nHave a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of uh\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts me through the state department of education\nTo develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school into high schools\nYou've got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people are here now doubt or an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum day and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nBut this idea of talking about feelings that fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes as the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S a bit less than half\nGet treatment this night also funnel people to we'll treatment as opposed to education and it you know there's opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nThink what we say in response said look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like that\nBasic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's cleanliness and he's the CEOs and unpleasant mental health association of New York state one of the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just
