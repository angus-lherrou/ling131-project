I Know the are the guys dealing with it would have been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get a lot of footage to view and foster very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or is no we've gotten to people from the footage\nSo would use many different techniques like linked serious discussion Web I Would take time for the folks each until we moved to ... ... scientists and appearing mostly because of a soup recognizes will recognize that person that we've got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if the ... and then we can start seeing is that the person can full\nNow London as you well know it was one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there's something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you is the detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nThey known that said ... which was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps\nAre pictures of suspects the oath I Would always look into the suspects sometimes ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... people will will kind of cases did you crack a very good one was there was a mouse\nIm persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... fun people well what kind of cases did you crack a very good one was there was a male who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... enough just to suspect I'd never met them before about seeing a picture of them full solve going around in the ... you give me ... we lost at the same\nAnd he'd been stopped several times other police officers who had recognized him on London's most wanted but luckily struggling cops when we took him back to fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell them how you found them\nWe did get quite often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate is a very unique skill\nJosh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nFor the science says we think they just sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability\nWe found some very small differences in the way that the brain function and I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going in future\n[noise] is it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think is a different function is is quite an interesting question that because people have done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition of let's say they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average\nAt recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams and numbers in words and things like that so it does seem as though it's a unique skill but these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact it was the opposite because as you could imagine in sort of pre history people if they've been very very small communities\nLeading to know a large number of faces with being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the ... and it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nStrange situation as far as the ... and it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis less and less notes the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces as well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is\nA human beings still beat computers I think in the future will will the situation's gotten so bad it's the best algorithms working with the ... the super

his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and I in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHas a maintenance I was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctorate level [noise]\nWell in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells\nAnd those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases and part of that break process\nAlso impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break\nSo to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer and so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\n[noise] well this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to insides and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gyms team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options [noise]\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out and might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had the moon shots program really giving a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year [noise]\nAn estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches the screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy

I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter] um\nWhat I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender I says chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tender eyes the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another track okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the breast pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there you're not an over or under\nCook it you've got a little bit of money here and some limits so that was so you would yeah that and I like it out a\nLot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken for fried show yeah and what's right with the honey isn't the hunting brings out the sweet flavor lives there but it's subtle to kind of pulls it out that's\nFavorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again\nYou can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having\nNot greasy food is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying\n's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go wrong and\nSo I saw is ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nSo you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispness\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\nI spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way authentic well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nWhich gives you a thousands of hours of\nPBS shows all the masterpiece dramas including the new season of poll dark all the seasons of Downton Abbey are on their nova nature all your PBS favorites as well as ... original productions\nFor you to stream on your tablet your computer or on your smart TV [noise] our thanks to you for supporting gp now is eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight that's eight hundred to two to four seven eight\nLooking to hear from you and five others by two o'clock thanks\nSupport for TB comes from you our listeners and Hartsfield Jackson airport offering a new ATM rewards program participants can earn points for parking dining and shopping and redeem them for miles hotel stays in more complete information at ... dot com slash wards\nAnd G.

found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out currently welcome\nYeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there in ... county\n[noise] we definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years two years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled\nJust this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students um this year we don't have the total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nDollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you're working minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nHere incomes going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that\nAre leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and once that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing an issue where people are getting priced out of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and\nLike I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes a little for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off there\nFamilies that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them\nUm it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go with out until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um\nAttention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nYou noticed that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lotta times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expects me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to ask\nThem and a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\n[noise] it's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different\nBut I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help where you get it\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to have\nThe resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations I Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive\nWe'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them closing that they need some times we've either ... medical supplies\nSome set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness\nIn school or eighty seven percent more likely to drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle or through class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students um their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing a potentially well and what they potentially could be [noise]\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had no self value", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
