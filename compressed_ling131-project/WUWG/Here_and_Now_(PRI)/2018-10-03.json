Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize\nLet's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas\nBritish scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize\nLet's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university uh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates\nThere they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nThe laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery to the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\n[noise] well uh being able to identify a process within a cell\nAnd to have that sell live through the next generation continuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of natural selection it'll survive if that new process improves the environment for that so\nWhy is this work significant\n... the ability to actually\nGo into a simple cell as we might think of it\nAnd to do some fundamental chemistry 'cause actually a lot more complicated than it sounds as if we do\nChemistry in a beaker a flask who we control of fewer of uh the the variables sun and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we'll alternately observe [laughter]\nBut you know you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living sell a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker and ... the real breakthroughs here to be able to\nTune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary processes is really what so spectacular here and now we're\nReading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also\nThis is really what's so spectacular here and now we're\nReading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals are what are some of the real world applications of this [noise]\nWell to be able to use the ... the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule because where the real creativity comes in [laughter]\nSo imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells and have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex\nChemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment [laughter]\nUntil really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker for doing it in these um these organisms enable us to\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example I'm of a natural process\nGod created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the war on generates um ethanol or alcohol and a production of beer or wine\nOkay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou you're away from him so perhaps somewhat protected protected from the immediate ... says can happen today\nI Can't reach the [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nOr as a friend is Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna stripped Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] well I'll also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry\nWell also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year [noise]\nUm and but you're absolutely right and the case of professor Arnold ... she's the first woman and prior to that it was ... Hodgkin's in\nNineteen sixty four that was recognized and then you start going way back to Marie Curie and Nineteen uh Lebanon and actually her daughter um several of two decades later so\nFor us in the American Chemical Society where we're at the center for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically\nFor folks from all different backgrounds and perspectives across recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic Peter door how is president of\nThe American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas Oh thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a ...

largest unsolved art heist in history was another apple pie August\nHere and now it was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that\nThat was what threw him back over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cast treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling but then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline report it is the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls a seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline cause tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like it's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls\nWelcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been a very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago ... say on friday or calls were a little more than doubled from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call you right now what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact and we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault\nUm so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if they are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and\nIt's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this the head of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl we all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd his friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help but when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about is the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen and we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways\nChoked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically one of three ways we are going to fight\nOrgan experience fried or we're going to fleet and ... the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes some back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define a frequently what the worst part of that experience wives\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender\nBut we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way that trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma and incredibly intense way well\nSome of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that\nMoment that was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to any without was exactly like for her yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nTeddy Davis President Reagan his daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her list\nPeople including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her let's listen to little then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd Brazil again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhen you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victim blaming and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma\nIs being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and as a so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors\nAnd it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault with her that assault was\nFive days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years really lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to a victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city":
