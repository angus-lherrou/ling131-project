years ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen\nTrump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment\nWill story Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that at bake you know Ninety seconds and uh back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that and the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I wanted to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSuddenly like ... ... people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nAnd like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold it so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I read\nIt might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called allied or when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor [noise]\nWhat are you able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know [noise]\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had no inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a\nA feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that I was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot\nWriter and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never sign a nondisclosure I'm not stupid [laughter] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy\nWith you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out but then somehow got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward and\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise]\nUm I think we're about to find out on what is the December twelve [noise]\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it you know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of names I have a pretty thick skin being any adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWill you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal\nThey're in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reasons for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal um ... because there would be a record and so I figure it nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lives mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they are awesome [laughter] but what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel on how would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all [noise]\nUm no not not much ice does stand by that feeling you know\nAsk anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their biggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have companies and people at high power um\nAnd then the other thing about that is that people who grow very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today\nHow would you describe him today [noise]\nKnow I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night on now with him he can make complete sentences [noise]\nUh there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your uh let's\nThere's a report in the wall Street Journal this week that or just the Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nActually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\n[noise] uh actually the exact opposite from running for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over\nAnd over there not following politics closely things yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially thing away from anything about me where you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote [noise]\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can get done how fast can get print that how fast can this happen it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publisher smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nThat in itself is a

run the whole gamut and what would you say is the genre overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for pop\n'em but it definitely
