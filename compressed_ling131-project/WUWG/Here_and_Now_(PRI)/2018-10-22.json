from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month [noise]\nLike millions of people across the globe\nAnd I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night\nBut what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nGuy and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha hide so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families and their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nThe yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we owe the ... the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about what had happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram boy yeah partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative\nBut also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise]\nFor about six weeks it was quite well they um ... still processing what happened to them so that was part of it it wasn't for us we're not count says to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to buddy ... any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly\nThough twofold I think the government also wanted to manage how the rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is the full and association with down and they were really\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to us\nAnd and they were released [noise]\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would order it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his uh they did give his diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that law enforcement goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWell the coldest and the full Boko Haram treatment [noise] uh and in the film what we do is the uh the bills that the girls who were taken was actually just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by by her um who are free to speak\nAnd they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as\nWell so such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid says I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the phone is that you kind of had two options in the forest either he marry a soldier for either come slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier to the Gulf felt like they you know we're right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say see you know as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my maybe of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well a year and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will say well ... has been kidnapped and children but also older\nAnd here you have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with the car um and and they tried to take back territory they will ... uh people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kicking up but they've just for their towns out of fear of Bulger run they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention\nGlobally yeah is this phone saying I think older folks is being on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they called them id Pete camps or intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his book her um you know they don't just kid not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers on that with the food aid is going to see how if you want food and he wants to live that's why you have to run\nAn ... but then a lot of the I Love the town of displaced people end up living within the community say\nDespite the fact that they can die as some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled ... Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan [laughter]\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and he just nuts\nSo when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was six suicide attacks\nIn one night and he just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women ... to ... they stop them up and send them you know towards checkpoints so they manage to make it into ... said the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I say there's a lot of mistrust [noise] what about\nThe girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future or the government is making it possible for some to attend college including a some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your from\nNot let him\nMany ... he's alright ...\n\nSupport for G.

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy tomorrow\nAfterwards where do we have fought for less than ... take on the same time we'll buy but we can't we can't say whether you\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google thing\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now and John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with ranking behind the ...\nThat's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and also trying to reform at some of the advertising in two brand of content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn it let's take this first change Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty second breast or I'd be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods ... what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pod so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty seconds units which are actually a second year this I've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a\nMarshall pods so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you'd as they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it to ease the pain of watching as\nThe also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRain arrives right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much so is Fox ... thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industry is\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest than they'd is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nThan your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day and so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using their cars we already own\nAnd they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day and so getting around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own set of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nWe fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority of the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specific how get around works right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days he picked our car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to a Tesla to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there is ... uh which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\n[noise] you know we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more this market grows for all players\nSome of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat do you what do you think about that I mean are people really eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs I don't know the methodology on the clock study um I I certainly know what we've seen in it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers is that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of public transit car sharing en route\nPeople are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership does absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and in you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to ... or so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWill speaking of super and Toyota neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one been\nSort of very aware of in fact I taught him was cars that trove is to the idea of getting around which is if your car could drive itself what'd you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day he'd probably the other people use it and maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just you know it makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people all the different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road I told them to the ethical are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\n...

Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how\nA condoning what happened or even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a

newcomer Bob ... in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our senator record this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race as a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nThe ... election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race he's a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nHi Jeremy so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in Mr trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since ... at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy he was you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office is critical\nDespite all of that uh there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just drop several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to [noise]\nWhat about Bob ... he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAt the end of the day is a question about just\nJudgment you want sitting biting\nOff you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not wise with three times for those cancer patients politically need that\nHe has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also\nAnd it's for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[laughter] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade shooting would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know ... settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the\nCampaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the the Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's ... he's the first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nAnd from the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[laughter] yeah I'm a you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank will be on does retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate\nIt is because of ... support and the party and just as you know popularity previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with a federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why rock of member station WBUR democracies and K O W reports progress is slow\nWashington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represent survivor who's Weiss wasn't hurt\nDidn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offenders still on the street\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested it didn't solve the problem now there's a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water two cases emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process more quickly this here Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow core doors so this again this is the biology lab get any laboratory supervisor Christian flavor\nIn front of the rooms are last window on the other side scientists is testing of rape you can see the white box that's close to the window sill with the paper bags\nWe'd ...\nThey're filled with material and Q tip like swabs of body fluids elected by a nurse after a rape\nSet this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are robots have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and key can the robots do three times of the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency so is another word you might be unfamiliar with\nBut do it three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency so is another word you might be unfamiliar with guys and sleeper explains that they basically did a hack us on using a Japanese productivity philosophy called ...\nRape kit testing follow something like an assembly line and the idea was to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked it used to be that it\nCould take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next up\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence for many sexual assault cases testing the kids helped uncover three hundred a serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nYou're listening to hear now [noise]\n\nSupport for G.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shapes on a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decide but they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\n[laughter] well there is certainly is\nA ration who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\n[laughter] well there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens I'm outta smartphone now and it is because it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post the lights on Instagram poses so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but\nGeneration Z or our job is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds\nSo say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds that's definitely more common among ige and then it was just take ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy issue this generation\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last\nFew years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\nThrough 'em but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nOur companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nHad they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's there's such a big a generational shift\nI think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors they're very interested in\nPhysical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on it\nAttitudes and their behaviors they're very interested in\nPhysical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think as well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these\nPotential voters will actually vote Generation Z people [noise]\nI Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics than teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do there's always the\nPossibility of a you know something new to say on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... said special I saw that in some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nAnd say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard some\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them so absolutely\nThey're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think ... is definitely not the
