now it's a quirk of Florida politics every Twenty years around three dozen people gather together to come up with amendments to the state constitution Florida is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nYou live in Florida on election day\nTogether a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace or you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military [noise]\nThese two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did is it packed\nThings that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's how Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandated State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between motherhood Napa by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom than some legal experts see it this time is different\n[noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans or Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not ... was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see\nShe says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection game is offers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nThe thing really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that\nFor the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission wanted to stop voter fatigue\nJust meet this short or an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat he needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you unfold different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the road the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami whether you're a\nVoter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThird example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all take who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nThat's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nOverall the total number a statewide measure as has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measure\nIt measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\n[laughter] so what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with\nElections and voting [noise] yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting marijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year\nOr other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThey process varies by state the number of senators required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand in a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives so does that\nMean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be gene\nTo voter there are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group but a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as a sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and\nUh the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove the rural and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part\nThe citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the page has blocked the implementation\nAnd there is an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface the response to twenty six the initiatives was\nSupport for ... comes from our monthly sixteen years and

Olsen and yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument that the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is Rudy session like some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating at a certain moment some of gyms quibble like make the audience go oh this guy thing where they kill us but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like five you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going well I did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players\nTo be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of cars they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night in single is standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the book that which they kindly gave was for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's the she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana damn it every night as I come down to the moment of the play where decision has to be made you and your character have not made up their mind until the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nOther it's often you if you publish Illinois all every night now that are going to be talking about post show deeper\nBringing money [laughter] single wrote in my book thanks for having John's back all I can\nTalk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalists\nAre thirty one step closer to thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or\nNews for me to say at a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs given to the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nOr the difference in or the or an artistic peace being written in an effort you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty for it because you like the way that number's sounds and gave obviously this that you care just not a bad guy we're in real life\nOr home about a guy anyway he's just he's a writer as an artist\nBut in your life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed them and they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles for reading articles for New York times he's reading the looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nWith his own world effects to choose from the wrong facts getting the way of the story\nAnd you have a says there on fact what does that mean exactly\nYou got to be aware that we have a presidential ... person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts you're nodding cherry\nInteresting because there was a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and it frequently gets applause the argument is basically that\nIf you were reading something all watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time this person and so forth and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going to a completely you are going to father didn't know the difference of math as you go to Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it true or you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain play give single do start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's planning in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes\nIn in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense\nYou do both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talked about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is what it\nSaid was strangling each yes yes on ... you know winning that fight [laughter]\nIt's not a U.S strangling Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a

communities worldwide learn more poster Smith dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nSit here and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nine is because one state\nThe rats guy does not have both the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWent over well with a straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they ruined candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments are in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\nWell they run on issues like ah lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also wrote on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes\nI mean to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans an edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and hit a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines in most cases their own state legislator lines that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade\nBut yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election that tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nAnd less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impacts throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year a water the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of the state house as\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be sort of a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind at their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans I'm for a variety of reasons the Republicans control about\nIs it this would be sort of a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans I'm for a variety of reasons the Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislators seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they are basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\nSince Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures of twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats and legislators as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're printing into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators due to most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are ... is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and\nYou know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota in Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican\nUm there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to ... million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big
