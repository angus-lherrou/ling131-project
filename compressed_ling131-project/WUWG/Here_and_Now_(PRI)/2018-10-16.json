Jeremy and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we do it as a fully hasn't come out yet a there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king ... the father a mom it's been ... on his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a broke group of people may be having a ...\nA and then that's what the Saudis are floating at the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they're they're facing the threat of sanctions and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and when\nYou said the explanation was being crafted does that imply that my ... the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft the explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out like Mike Pompeo is there a while if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered a that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses\nThe president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something\nEngages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia are not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the uh economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nAnd reform and you're listening to here in la [noise]\n\nSupport for TB programs comes from our listeners and Hartsfield Jackson airport offering a new a tale rewards program participants can earn points for parking dining and shopping and redeem them for miles hotel stays in more complete information at ... dot com slash towards\nOn the next fresh air growing up with an accent mother who is addicted to heroin and raised by grandparents who gain legal custody the captain Jared J. ... about his new graphic memoir for young adults\nHey kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction it's nominated for a National Book award\nThe lunch ladies series China\nFresh air coming up this afternoon three right here on eighty eight point five TPP\nTonight on gp teeny taken magical journey to another world through some of America's Best love novels or middle earth to little put trials and tribulations of these alternate universes help\nUs better understand our own world that's the great American read tonight at eight [noise] funding\nFor here and now comes from W.

Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now thanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal [noise]\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start [noise]\nStart it somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than [noise]\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama but the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president and you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term mad after you know I started a post them more and then I heard the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\n[noise] you also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest crowd in history was really an January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean I kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other than that that the picture was what prove what was true yes\nI Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's a very rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is a minute\nVery rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me as if um if there is uh my uh Israel and followers\nHave my back and they they end up coming back to the end they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know is that Russian botched but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in science around feed just\nAnd saying what they want to say\nIn this book you've got a often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one I'm looking at right here\nBy President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community it staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf\nAnd but to to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know tell me in cheek hook poke if I guess what's\nThe one that you're most proud of\nThe like I Can't believe I thought of that\n[noise] ah the the [laughter]\nI have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nMe you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a which I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps a in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a witch at a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which\nI I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he has more integration and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox\nThe theme of a President Trump saying that if more people that have been operation and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News beat every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty Times Union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up\nA ... and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest in history [noise]\nIt seems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened to show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\n[noise] ah yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to\nEspecially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was when he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling and little rocket man and rocket man and\nYou know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nYou know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and it just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nUs ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the ... you\nKnow these are all the pictures that were previously made public or in the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next door do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of presidents\nTo do that so [noise] so what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next door do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for [noise] what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise]\nUm because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day [noise] um someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nThe highest figure since late two thousand and you're listening to hear it now [noise]\n[noise]\nGeorgia has out dated voting machines they've made

[laughter]\nI don't know about special in this but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves and the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms in it for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group\nIn the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nIt well you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students\nThese what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity of developing that\nBeing part of a larger group having colleagues is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for ... kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced having\nLook we search also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience and let's say the teachers are white and the students are black and\nThey have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student is not a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nThis is an unheard of in twenty

reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there is\nIt's probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated net you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I Would say two things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice is what we've done for nearly a hundred years\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these are students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room\nAnd the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school but look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to expand it what's going on\nAnd we will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what it what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the components of students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all
