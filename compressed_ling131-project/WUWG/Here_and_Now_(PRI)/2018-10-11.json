immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to us\nCities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there was a work of plenty that's not something that I see that uh that you should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act he's also known as the sanctuary locked and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union Los Alamos city manager Detroit Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue [laughter] how do you respond\nTo some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on the major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation [noise]\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and seen a phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I'd probably the best example and the real life example I gave us ...\nSeen a phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism I'm fat guy probably the best example and the ... for example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years\nAnd wait and turned to get into the United states that so you know that is the way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or race is\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with Los Alamos in defined the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest I\nHe said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be that it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue pages I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods [noise]\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them so they were talking about criminal\nOrganizations that are doing this\nBut he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on or about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so are the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary\nFifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so are the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our presidents that they're going to be treated respectfully with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them\nWell we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response and there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did [noise] other than to send a political message\nThey're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who enters our city and that's what it means to be a century city\nAnd when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nIs a liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law the land oftentimes talks about [noise] a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable cities than than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you were only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that a city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we respond ... responded criminal behavior irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice say makes their job more difficult what do you say that I\nAm so federal authorities hum are you know that they have the mandate to um to enforce federal law\nAnd more difficult what do you say to that so federal authorities hum are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law that we do not\nAnd so that they dislike lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and they do that so [noise] um the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to college for help\nIf they're not calling the police who are they common right so um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in what the residency status were not respond and it's just the folks to call for help\nSo that the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues for here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place it detain Iran\nUnfair treatment and you're listening to her now
