majors many of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls to big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded to charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those that help to go to college in Boston was an athlete named Catalina\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married\nNow ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the DR\nAnd it is building a charter school that'll teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors she says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of young prospects to not finish high school\nAnd then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life\nThey don't know what to do so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed ... you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too of course\nIt happened to my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners and we should say you come from a baseball family you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a\nLittle league and the DR that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had by hopes yes they receive a really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one she play in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so both of them were signing sixteen\nAnd they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to define themselves in terms of life and okay so I was released and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit in a classroom with high school kids [laughter]\nI'm I'm always exposed to this type of situation is because of what my parents do and because of ... and they just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives what could you do for somebody who's older like that\nBeen released and they don't know how to go back to society to their lives what could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping our young people who\nMay hope to go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance so what we're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm\nTechnicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means nutritionist professional trainers massage therapists positions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back\nAnd get a job either with another team an ... or maybe at an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball players\nBut is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids\nCould be realistic and as American all thirty teams of ammo will be have academies where they signed the players so there is a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many things that's going to be me one day\nAnd do and Pedro when you go there and you go there are a lot find yourself having to say to young people [noise] yeah I really hope so but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut grounds them what do you do when you say which is exactly what you said that baseball is not everything\nThat there are other options in life yeah but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent of fathers that did not make it and it's becoming more of a cautious conversation topic and the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your route Thailand\nThere's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layers double A. that doesn't like you\nIf he doesn't like you he's not going to give you play time period\nYou started wanting to be a sports broadcaster [laughter] being married to a sports star you are now in charge of this

now I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I represent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand or maybe two thousand\nAnd that other kid that I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four ... percent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand\nThat's what it means to me I can help and other ...

I'm Peter O'Dowd ... now authorities have taken one person into custody today in connection with the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump twelve packages had been discovered so far the latest address to senator Cory Booker and to the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's Quil Lawrence has been following this story Quil what do we know about the man who was arrested earlier today\n[noise] his name is ... or say arc or fifty six years old he's from uh Ventura Florida just north of Miami\nA possibly born in New York but has lived in Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including\nA theft and fraud charges um and what's perhaps the most telling about him if uh the the media reports and the victim of pictures we've been seeing of his van are in fact his is just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van in stickers ah where he has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump\nOr and also against George Soros\nI'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic Kennedy and Andrew Gillum down\nTheir police were said to have known about this man is he said he had a criminal past you know what it is that led to stories directly to him\n[noise] there had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from\nA very quickly and experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have been left behind because these packages included tape and plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA um so it's already is we're we're moving very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida\nAnd we can assume that they tracked from the the or possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these packages might have been sent from [noise] but it's early days\nAnd we'll do you have any idea and just how he was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nHe was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nWe know he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of a shopping center a plantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\n\nSupport for G.

spit of sand known as east island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals today it is mostly underwater hurricane will lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally wiped Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only slippers of land where the eleven acre island once stood out\nIf it earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\n[noise] well it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a block I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that that might be a\nHead into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures that here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you [noise]\nWell it's a beautiful place hum my research team which consists of\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical because the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um things are nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one uh that remained what\nAre the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this was very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they\nI have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the dune area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turned to the north to some of the other ... there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane did this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured I'm\nAt this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence I didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very\nStrong chance of being intercepted by hurricane but of course of climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new area of new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nJust twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\n[noise] yes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands [noise]\nUh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category since last year hurricane season in\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking with the growth in hurricanes they're getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's down to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves may push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding\nThey may push that stand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the Saudi Arabia or don't exist\nTo fluctuate a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us you\nKnow the conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because the focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in rent and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that's shipped about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what did we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do nice pair comparison right we are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth states in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution all means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about is\nThis an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like\nOh in fact there is like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans then meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important ... believe it or not that our individual consumption enjoys and what\nKind of movement I mean like when you give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat anymore but you know instead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nHot springs in the area where swept away by the ... and you're listening to here and\n\nSupport for deep ... comes from generous listeners like you our reporters have been honored with national awards from public radio news directors incorporated for our use of sounds soft feature and our coverage of breaking news thank you for your support which allows us to keep you informed about stories that impact your life\nAnd show your parts of Georgia you don't otherwise hear about count on us to bring you comprehensive coverage of the state check out our website a gp news dot org GB news stand with the fact\nWas a little more than a week ago until election day it appears the conduit for governor remains a toss up one of the factors that will tip the balance Ryan camps or ...\n... as the raised some issue flows literal rewind insiders will be here to breaks out every step of the Bush to the finish line and we'll look at what's happening in other races on the ballot for\nCars and statewide offices joined us today [noise] funding\nOn the ballot for Congress and state wide offices joined us today to\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

one of the new piece change in the air\nEh\n\nEh Mm Mm Mm\nUsing is refund phrase music as good as a model for the album hit the top of the charts early this year we spoke with Bill for example about the album this spring appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around that's\nBeen a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment are picked up a guitar oh there's the social aspect with you don't have always been a shy person an awkward but with that guitar it was like this magic wand that seem\nBringing every one together and so all along the guitar has been about interacting with other people\nI Know there's you know there's just the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore was for you know but it's something that sort of hanging out there in front of me that I Try to\nI'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take us\nBeing out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech caught like talk about a nightmare situation\nIf you could only have hadn't interact with you yeah yeah I mean to be able to tell a thing as long as I've got that in my hands than everything is cool so then why another cell album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself and dear\nTo another level yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's a because over the years it's become\nJust another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and\nIt was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so\nA year later I tried it again and then I kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually\nDo this and it started to feel like music seems like every time to talk about I think for\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time like this what comes to note or sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you're done usually it's just a\nMelody just a very simple you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nPretty stars to shine and\nThat was something I quote unquote wrote that book and the album ... and then made the when I wrote it\nI recognize that it was a very very common\nCore prior to the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York and I was like some of the music that I Would record and I played that song\nPlaying at this club called the stone in New York and I was like some of the music that I Would record it played that song and a guy the club ... one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of Jessie\nJ what what do you talk about some just to play you this recording that was like oh my God that's Hussain\nSix almost the same malady and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional songs like probably hurt the cheap to treat you play it when I was five years old or something\nLike a mock isn't making them back to be in trouble now but I think it's you know it's like a public domain kind of thing and that there's so much music float around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing or am I remembering it or what is it\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to ... to ...\n... ...\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one or that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen sustained and the other\nProcess so they're sort of a drone\nDown\nWas originally from the guitar and then that's going on like a larger Otto pedal because she\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for just\nOne solo or a\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen is you're playing both composing is you know happy you know these are pieces they\nNever feel like they're finished anyway but what I Do to prepare for the album was actually played six night down your every night at brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mine or new ones\nAnd I tried to keep myself just off balance for the whole week [noise]\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who is taking blood in your younger days hide behind your instrument it takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusually difficult uncomfortable place intentional\nOil but that's when the stuff really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming and you\nJump off a cliff and you you just start flying and that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take these chances but I say jumping off a cliff but
