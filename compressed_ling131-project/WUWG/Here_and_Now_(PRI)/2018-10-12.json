Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiative he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class in as well ... is with us in Studio welcome\nThank you very much he was just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWere pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of students took the course on students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the particular\nProgram school what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is\nAlmost a you know leave till the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but stand that in some schools now including Harvard some other groups study groups meet at ten or

Pittsburgh course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean\nFor the football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are due to the clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the

because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up step\nSolely in fact just the light the ...\nThey have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen and the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets their circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk I'm so during evolution or we couldn't see during the night time\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together and be in a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell there's that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths\nWilling and Matthew walkers book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nIn wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you interested well of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then came sleep keeps you hold\nYour leisure advertise if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks on the other adverse all comes\nDown to lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but I can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see\nFirst off comes down to lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but I can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the only\nPart of the programs are we call it sleep one on one very interactive program in which for example there's a dorm room\nAnd the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out the caffeine has a six to nine hour half life as many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on his sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nAll free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep consistency and the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThere do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually the\nInternal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found that those who have irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston\nAnd that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder that they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention to the middle of the night\nPlowed tiny change school life so that kids can Lonnie maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I have a teaching a freshman seminar\nEvery year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep ... for example that there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity\nSchool sanctioned activity and the first\nAh scheduled activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working we're talking to you most specifically about students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from bringing the Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers firefighters you took this probably twenty four percent less\nMatters initiative from bringing on Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters you took this probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury you have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post them to sit here and now dot org\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour a new one detail so we did a sleep disorder screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few validated questionnaires away identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders in order for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women have sleep apnea then that means that even if they set aside the time for this you can't breathe and sleep at the

health concerns inspector general's office\nIndia's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for the immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen cells how is that possible [noise]\nAh well that's a good question you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nThing these sort of or issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from events in so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nShould we imply then that that many people inside the facility worst suicidal or or could they have been for some other reason making those choices yeah I I don't\nThink so um you know people are told the inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guards sort of laughed at them off and then called them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempt weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nOne of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a questions of untimely an inadequate medical care um and\nThis has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation\nAnd you know the thing about an immigration detention is it's supposed to be what they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be tentative in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to happen and so when you're using\nThe disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth [laughter]\nI'm like what is the last say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving the immigration\nDetention is governed by or what are called his

killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nShot you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nThat'd be a source close to touch investigation has said turkey has gone documents that evidence to support the claim off state sponsored mud ... she went into the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that and of course official position is still that show she is missing about that a Texan ... knows for sure that he was mud\nI'm not a back up the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that\nAnd they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten and some reports that his body was just men but I'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still silently denying all the allegations how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this strange communication strategy with his governments have an techie where they don't really speak directly\nWell in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media um this is funny strange communication strategy with his government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to foreign media for example they and they actually have a ... kind of communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach that for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation that the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to put all our diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead king\nI'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that type thing the screws on the Saudis and tried to get the ... western backing for the position that question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible\nIt can be if it includes the Saudi Government\n... and and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a a diplomatic nice city on the politics of the tux entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their espresso allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all the the biggest\nJailer of journalists I mean yes it has been ... by turkey which has such as a spot and\nYou know that says a techie is not treating journalists in the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged arbitration that it's not murdering hey we're talking about uh how to get locked up journalists which is obviously a also an attack on press freedom and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance still between the two cases I think here\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and they stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the relation with Saudi Arabia is important\nIt doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly tech he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its sovereignty hate it won't support from the U.S and other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis when speaking of ...\nIt's ineffective flagrant violation of its sovereignty ate it won't support from the U.S in front of the western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis\nWhen speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story I Want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government oh what are we learning about\nThat yeah this is a country that produces more news than I can see him ready and American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nHe has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not to interfere with the independence of protects traditionally which is seen as laughable bike by critics of of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was a source of friction between the U.S and and ... governments\nThat sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency that as well and I expected to east to some extent and it\nWill be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark low in Istanbul thank you so much pressure\nNot back to the U.S where a candidate in Georgia's hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor and he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents Kemp campaign denies that it did anything wrong\nBut his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us\nThings around the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches the policy by which is all the information on the voter registration form down to the ... or ... doesn't match perfectly with the existing data and driver's license for Social Security formation their voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nTo most people on\nIn a driver's license or Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list I Know that they've been excluded\n[noise] they're supposed to get a notice in the mail but oftentimes people don't perceive those are understanding what they mean and so the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states without affect our eligibility or or voting at all\nOkay so in total comes off as a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since two thousand and twelve\nHis campaign is saying that he's making sure that only legal citizens cast a ballot and that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problems in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud in Georgia and all the voter list maintenance is important there's no connection between aggressively purging the voter rolls the way Georgia has been making elections more secure at\nCamp is also a putting a fair amount of the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent she started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called the New Georgia project in camp is making the point that\nIn the process of signing thousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nVoter registration drives our a vital lifeline to get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happens\nStates shouldn't do everything they can to resolve those discrepancies or Georgia is doing is making it the voters burden to resolve that problem instead of trying to fix that themselves [noise]",
