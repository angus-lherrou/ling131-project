mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because he can't keep them a lot of the\nTo ... you were able to put those feelings can use on\nIt like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nSo it's true I'm playing the we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple momentum the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to just to be a different experience from musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be zone experience and to live on its own\nNow any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... and ...\nAnd experience and to live on its own how really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really mean something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sort of hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In Evin first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had fled here\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty becoming more sweaty I've been through the rabbit hole before but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity and the intensity\nWith with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters well talk\nThis notion that you're writing about suicide guy I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of there is in a in a mission they gave me to tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey only get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him and some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um\nYou leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about countered you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us that it not feel mano causal\nI'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media\nEvan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that [noise]\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ...

and children mostly from Syria Iraq and to Africa have arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore get clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards fill up can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first love doing mischief knowing one's limits if you've been calling for them says but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nWay we turned to monitor and ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were eager to that people take care of their team took care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care but has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams have to make sure that they stay with them\nA car if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise one of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugee so that the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult in in desperate and\nYou're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath ear able to get for permission to have my cat\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one conducive safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nTo do something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that we're going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\n[noise] one of the things that you and your colleagues have noted he is a potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece up pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nWe've been impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were parts of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seems to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece needs ... workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work and takes on a shared a humanitarian motivation [noise]\nOne more question\nBeen warm sons and better for those kind of work takes on a shared humanitarian motivation [noise]\nJust have one more question um I have known for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise the hive learned in the states to get back to the origins of all my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nTo be able to go back and offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and from above the work that we do\nUm the recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way both professionally I'm
