left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over not at all not at all just means being emotionally intelligent\nAs we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution to help build a public conversation about the big issues of the day you have to really be good at of emotion management [laughter] you know it's a contribution to the larger whole\nTo be really good about I'm Krista ... and this is on being\nStrangers in their own land with a finalist for the national Book Award Harley ... there's a professor emeritus at Berkeley and was born in Boston, Massachusetts so you were at the child of a foreign service officer so you sound like you grow up all over the world\nYeah [laughter] I ah lived in Israel and uh and I'm from aged a twelve to fourteen very pivotal experience\nAnd then I'm New Zealand willing to New Zealand and then my folks were in Guyana and I spent the summer and gone up but by then I was in college and then they weren't Tunisia [laughter] so I was very\nFortunate really to get to experience that yeah yeah\nI was there I'm a religious or spiritual background to your child hid 'em in your family are in those places\nYeah I Would say um my parents were a very religious Unitarian so and uh\nSo yeah I Would say um my parents were a very religious Unitarian so and uh for you ... the message I took away is that it's a very big world and we have to learn to\nSo they get right just ... yeah but you can see ... it's my effort to get at feeling yeah and how detached it can be come from fat [noise]\nSend somebody I think a lot about and to me this comes through and you talking about um\nThat deep story cars and that and as you said the fact facts and moral pre sects a rise out of ... actually I take some milk shake that mattered a story\nMoves them from it right about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a felt true yeah and when I went back and forth between ... and the people I came to note and really respect and\nThe other world of the south um\nSouthwest Louisiana I came to to realize that if there were different truth the truth and so there are facts I Believe in the reality is yes the deep story and again we all have a deep story yeah um\nIt were Powell certain facts that don't and it invites other facts to do\nKrista ... says on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion hardly homeless shelter\n... and this is on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion or early ...\n\nUm take up what you call a key whole issue [noise] um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to really understand the dynamics anytime it to the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country or in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and great pollution and great relief resist says to regulating polluters and I I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that would say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a the background I think\nFrank I'm partly I think the people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger better\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out of the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this passage in in the book that I I Am strangers in their own land that I\nI just this is just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know that you're Harold ... the state yeah always seems to come down on the little guy he no he does is take this by you if you're motorboat leaks little gas into the water the word no right you up but if companies leak thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life here\nThe state lets them go\nDire that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are so rich and powerful that say basically have a bomb the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral majority work to the state [noise]\nThe legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral majority work to the state [noise]\nSo they say oh pay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives some ... ... ... I think it was one point six billion dollars that a boy was the last five years and there is an offer to companies\nTo come in with fat public money now came from Texas [laughter]\nUm is aids and can make donations to the autumn on\nSociety or for new football uniforms for LSU game to looking good and setting up third grade classes and chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state is your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also describe [noise] this interesting dynamic that um\nThat again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious anybody out a lot of this is true but I mean for example\nYou um [noise]\nYou you had this chapter called there were members\nAnd there is something where you you ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory cell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmental is\nSo much complexity their\nHeart does mine yeah oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in one area where you said the crab pots\nAre no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where you know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're caught I mean people working in the plants and I talked to a woman who said you know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and uh\nI don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYou know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right alongside her purse and you know and it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you know I like California is very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environments result it's at that level to guilt is not a personal one right\nSo that she was very poignant and sweet of her to be mindful that you know an operator might feel accuse [laughter] yeah [noise]\nAnd scan poignant this whole thing gets\nIt as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may we made it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking [noise]\nAnd let's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversational anybody else you know you're coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think\nThe people I came to know are very interested and very approving of renewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that Tea Party that's up all for renewables but we're not even finding common ground because we aren't even worse\nGreen tea move that Tea Party that's up\nAll for renewables but we're not even finding common ground because we aren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our ... still in fact I I think that problem but remains with us and especially on the left I think uh\nThere's a kind of a rich and the sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out\nFor potential common ground [noise]\n[noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee hopes failed [noise]\nWe're putting all kinds of great extra his entire pod cast defeat poetry music and the new feature lifting the question [noise] get it all as soon as this release twenty subscribed to on being an apple pie can Google type cast modify of wherever you like to listen\nBecause I was gonna say what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it had that we have and and the other player I taught at work right you could you can't just blurted out well how you really feel about what someone fed at every moment\nOf a no no they're rules about that there should be some kind of a ground rules of social wires\nYeah yeah yeah one thing I can get really better at it than than we are so that's a great invitation yes it doesn't mean that you're ... see that's the misunderstand the I think yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over the uh\nNot at all no not at all ... and just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed a way of talking [noise]\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction when you barrel on in there and ignore\nYeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction when you barrel on in there and ignore the competence\nIdentities personality to yeah just counterproductive\nIt is counterproductive and sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points that might be made I I Want to say you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of a larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and in order to do that\nYou have to really be good at it the most management [laughter] you know make it it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAbout\nI'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion hardly hawk shield\nToo out strangers in their own land and this time you've spent um [noise] in Louisiana\nIs and it's a Bible belts right one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considered to be an lightened is um [noise] uh\nThat regulation that a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ...\nHerring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made a lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense and in fact government\nHuh [laughter] sold out so question okay what has the government dumped few you know maybe they will point may be a it hasn't lived up to ...\nPulled out so question okay what has the government done phew let's you know maybe they will point may be a\nIt hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed some things that didn't do okay let's figure that out All right back full public conversation about just about [noise] it is the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or they expecting too much of it\nWhat's the record about oh let's let's talk about that and the specific yeah yeah [noise]\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just list do you say even among the most ardent and extreme or ... I think maybe this was another interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nHe found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure\nUm ... it's so interesting to think about what if we started by saying\nA what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise] right [laughter] wherever hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah\nYou I'm\nAnd I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left to write a letter to Louisiana friends on the argued say ... you know if if you imagine if I if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and in your letter to\nYour friends on a liberal left I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and a human way consider the possibility that and their situation you might end up closer to their perspective [laughter]\nThat's it [laughter] I mean I think that's true that we are products of our own experience [laughter]\nAnd what if you grew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't do it out a great childhood but we were poor you know [laughter] um okay what if that had been York's\nAnd he said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [laughter] um okay what if that had been your experience\nAnd what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was the blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nI think that there's some thing actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two in people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nOr at the blue collar class that lived there serious look we're the daily workers we're climbing the telephone pole to repair our telephone wire or re paving roads where\nWere you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nThe little cocoon I've long in here as I Am and a kind of you know it's not only a a contempt the really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um [noise]\nAnd that is buried to some degree [laughter] thought there's the kind of a reluctance to to reach out says is on the left there's a lot of good political well but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions\nBecause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them or we need our sturdy coalitions and I think labor unions when the labor movement was much larger and um [noise]\nThere there was a way that people of different colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight with different colors\nAll of a different colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nDrink right with different colors and and in classes got together natural way they're gonna be theory on each other they we're you know public school system is but we're down on those [laughter]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired if every one\nOf every one where there yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different regions and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go across to see if we can rebuild those [noise] that connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I I came to this conversation myself that um [noise]\nThis critique that they're all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country\nAnd they ran this late right and I ... yeah yeah and especially now yet again and it's when white people\nThat you know the critique that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise] yes I I think it's an excellent point", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "21"}
