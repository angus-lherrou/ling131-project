S. political spectrum\nBeing to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big following on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta she enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nAnd the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nTrue back and forth mark at once by bedrock different and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nI'm relationship it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I\nMoved here two thousand sixteen um\nWhat started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever one [noise]\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work\nAbout repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it [noise] and that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum [noise]\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we\nInvolve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we\nGot to this place and um\nThat kind of think that this phenomenon of trolls is like a\nWhite is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that image and and being ... um [noise]\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well he said he said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word we choose trolls right through the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq than they are very ... humanizing latch um\nI I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um\nOne was um\nNo one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pools talking to neo Nazis and talking to a terrorist people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these crows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or are cooler unkind um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck but here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships\nIn our lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still um\nOur lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still [noise] um\nNo one wants to be careful what did we do with that what do we do about that because we are we're we're seeing this well the only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are\nAnd really forgotten it's a ... or it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and then they thought\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize no thanks but why don't you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we have more kindly\nThere's this dehumanization of technology that then allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of\nNurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah [noise]\nSo I mean part of what I think we do is\nStart to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious if you agree with this area because I I've come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to do book um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nA habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people among liberal who say oh they're game Trump supporters there so\nTo find and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people among liberal who say oh they're game supporters Mitt out there so racist and they're so as long a full but can I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I aged out of\nIt and we blame the people for than expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good\nAnd assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you liked me in spite of some of the some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people I still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nNew you've actually called that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught in one of the related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like fun [laughter] so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of Europe pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nIt said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm route a whole chapter in the book about that one yes and um\nAnd the word goat was in it and yes I'd like to talk too much about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed their saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond ... ask Erick Erickson what a you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nWe use the word so we made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand\nAnd this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nYou know in your voice totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since I'm ... the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't say there's about right\nActually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way\nAnd the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing pointed this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care uh\nAnd I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like we're record all those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington as the be all end all everything everything's abstract because none of us are in Washington [noise]\nUm you know look I think it's very ... and two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to provincial as emerging it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had\nSegregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way and which are neighborhoods have been shaped led to a lot of my opiate so I'd say that\nLook I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way to go first\nTo like look to the points that were making here if there was a sign that said that professes um that\nPeople can change and grow\nThat is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay\nPeople can change and grow\nThat is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress\nThat is the idea of progression that that does make sense it invites came in the country and in individuals and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing\nYou have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change and what can I ask\nYou when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve we can improve the others are we going to ... and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna there's just this is absolutely use those\nShoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives um a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do um but it don't him shooting motives\nTo the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background\nAnd we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or whatnot ... it may not be that they just want to us way to get their kid to hit it over your kid they may have real real reasons for wanting to do things are just getting out of ... motives would go a long way to helping things\nUm\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside and\nNo one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments so the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else you have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise] um\nLook we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological [noise] uh it's also racial economic um and you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these ... people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day out U.S Mexican cartels are\nThat\nYou know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools\nGrow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated\nSchool programs are actually reduce\nTheir racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other being together relating to each other but then has a much more positive effect more broadly\nActually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we um [noise]\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact uh [noise]\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or the proposition is that we we ... we're not going to let common ground\nAnd a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when more integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what\nDifference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop\nHating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you're not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have of what does shift watch what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um [noise]\nThe experience myself [noise]\nBeing unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of\nPeople being cruel\nAnd seeing the difference of mix\nIn yourself in for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\nBut it in them as well\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might be like a\nI had the\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in\nCredibly powerful stories of people who\nWere being a professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed\nThose dynamics aunt\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed\nThose dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because people who they had been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness to say I'm aware of the ... of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps\nIf you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and demand in some cases it's too much to ask you to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work and I I'm blown away by the difference it makes\nHuge I'm always struck um ... ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture\nThough what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall to start putting the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships and communities on line and we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes are Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that tried then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nWith the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people you know we were with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of them\nCancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line\nAnd not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to an actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee ... we both began having these internal conversations with having kids\nUm that level of local ... and I don't mean to keep working on local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know there's a there's a great Christian also rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot\nThat you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be sure where that would be\nFree Jesus\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to
