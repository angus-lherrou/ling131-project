freedom real apologies can bring in offers entry points first of all the histories that are not merely about the past\nAll of them had to be within living memory I really wanted it to be grounded in

to perform their sacred rituals and ceremonies that these things had been decreed barber is memorializing\nIn Eighteen eighty three and a law it occurs to me that you more or less grew up in the aftermath of that shift although probably when it was still in transition I'm just curious about that um is that somebody or aware of [noise]\nOh yeah it's definitely something I've I've been aware of [noise] I I Can't speak for all of my generation and I cannot speak for all local to people um\nSo I have luck with the family who is Christian but certainly for me it's like the more traditional teachings that\nImportant to me as I said before but even learning about\nCertainly it for me it's like the more traditional teachings that\nImportant to me as I said before but even learning about those things it's something that has come slowly because you know you have to find the right people and yeah the right family members and\nTalking about these things it's important to process of

listening to these narratives these histories and engaging in your conversation there is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial uh-huh allows a liberation\nSo I think that that's really um maybe what was important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back\nA hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years uh\nI didn't want to jump back to ... or send creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime this is not history this is not old history it's present in my life

it's the present and the future of the world we're creating\nIt's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I just that if the world we're creating\nI'm ... and this is on being today with the poet lately long filter [noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking at a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter]\nI'm a you know it's a one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it's not just the air not only talking about history you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is\nAnd and how when apologies are done well and and assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write\nIt just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received an avid start changing things in their brain really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has to be sincere I there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that\nThey were so you wrote in the beginning of the actually the beginning of the response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through [noise]\nUm I listen for cracks and nickels or in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from offensive [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nYeah [laughter] it was really important deliberation it just isn't something we need to learn to do together\nRight as a people\nIn that part of your citizenship\nThere's the physical presence\nEnergy that is important but on a national skill I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say you know a family members\nPersonal apology so there's things that um are bigger than a bigger than having just let's say you know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national level there's a lot more that goes with it right [noise]\nUm when I was writing this response or I started researching\nA lot of other apologies around the world um national apologies one of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada um\nFirst nations people the first nations right yeah I'm\nOn the boarding school to residential schools for what happened there and the taking of their children and so on and that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a lot\nTransmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language and the pacing of that apology [noise] um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said\nIn her opinion no things had really not really changed but she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties huh\nAnd doing what you said you would do\nWell but I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level\nFaint what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this ah [laughter] but it was signed on a weekend it was not read aloud there was no ceremony\nAnd they were no tribal leaders invited to witness it I'm right and that ceremony\nNow there is no ceremony\nAnd they were no tribal leaders invited to witness it I'm right and that ceremony is an important way\nTribal culture to make something meaningful or to signify that something has meaning [noise]\n\nI think it's important and tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah yeah right right right I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] Mm\nHere's lately long soldier reading some lines from her book whereas Mm I did\nNot desire in childhood to be a part of this but desired most of all to be a part of peace combined with others to make up a whole\nSome but not all of something in ... it's ...\nApiece or part of anything like the creek trickling behind my aunt's house where uncle ... bridge to cross from bank to bank not far from a grassy clearing with three key piece a place to gather\nI think of planes wins snow drifts ice and limbs the exposure and when I slide my arms into a wall coat and put my hand to the door knob

Institute helping build the spiritual foundation for loving world learn more at ... dot org\nI mean it's so many things about in in you know and and if you look at that sentence it's I'm\nAn amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand [noise]\nHave something like what if water right [laughter] and how a word like resource that gets thrown around and I throw it around all the time to like crazy it's like one of the big words now can be humanize us and be away into into belittling\nA source of life [laughter] I yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like they have to constantly put out this ... before he ever talk on some of these issues because\nYou know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for for all\nOn some of these issues because you know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for\nFor all local to people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert on any of these issues what it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship\nAnd seeing it in that way I mean even just for example\nOne of my friends posted something really funny on\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um to what was I think red will oh\nThis is the season for getting red wheelbarrow and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more than you need and leave the plant\nAllow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year bait so it\nIs always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive this awareness right I'm\nI'm downloading a sensibility huh of connection\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer you are trying something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right and the same place of course to water and a source of life [noise]\nI Wonder um you mentioned I'm a little while ago the air that you do talk about your daughter a lot in in your poetry and I know that you know and I are like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I Wonder if you had to read and and maybe this will like for you to use about because I'm not I'm not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but but a single voice of integrity and searching is a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in fact does not um [noise] there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to

from writing a CD of comfortably in my court because of a life lesson it provided writing has shown me what happens with patients\nAnd someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [noise] I Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and other way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to be human\nThrough the legs usually [noise]\nI think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected\nTo be a good fit [noise]\nI had never thought oh I Want to be a writer
