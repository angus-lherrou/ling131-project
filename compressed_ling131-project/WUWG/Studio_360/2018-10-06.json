fifties to the early eighties\nHad this curious Eastern European accent he'd been born and raised in rural North Dakota but in this room in speaking community child in the Nineteen sixties I remember both sets of mine to brass good grandparents were watching the show on Saturday night's primetime ABC\nAnd talked about generation gaps to me at the time ... was the epitome of TV and dated and square\nWhich is exactly how Paul boats dealt about the show was a kid now teaches media in communication at New York university and the colleges Staten Island [noise] and for our future called guilty pleasures he talks about how his opinion shifted a hundred and eighty degrees [noise]\nAs a kid I remember my grandfather a cattle farmer in South eastern Iowa he was\nAs a kid I remember my

Sherman was his first language and that's why he has this weird accent\nA little bit kind of water on the show\nHe carried the baton thank you very much\nAnd he played the accordion\nThis is what's so great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nThis is what's\nSo great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nThe Irish in America have been famous

to a higher note\n\nThere's this great rapport between them\n\nAnd then at the end he says [noise] listen to this\nIsn't that nice said he would let a German player for an Irish men here [noise]\nHe's referring to himself\nAs a German but of course is a German American there's a recognition that America of course is the land of ... of immigrants [noise] this is something that has been often lost in our contemporary rural America I think\nThe gentleman I'm wearing the official jacket of the future farmers of America\nThis is a modern foreign and he's the Norwegian when Laurence welk refers to him\nBut it's a national organization of some four hundred thousand high school boys on the farming areas of America\nAnd this was a group that every kid they grew up in a small town like my father my

out\nFarmer eventually as well [noise]\nYou know since the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies\nRural America has emptied out\nTown that my father grew up in er my grandfather farmed it's a ghost town that's why there's the certain melancholy to this show and to the program [noise]\n\nOne of the act's I remember on the Lawrence Welk show is the tap dancer or their Duncan who is one of the first
