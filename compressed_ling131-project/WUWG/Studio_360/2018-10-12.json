fourth place to be staged on Broadway\nThree three back welcome to steal three sixty\nThank you so this play is about the\nGreat actress of the second half of the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century a server and heart played by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here and the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career and Eighteen Ninety seven\nIn the ass that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea a end she wants to play rewritten to strip out\nThe poetry I Am certainly at the bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action\nOr yes she was somebody who is really known to be a sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the\nClassical dancer the poetry stood in a way out of the action which in fact it does make it so I just spent\nA year working on this argument but I wasn't sure watching the play that you bought her argument because she says it it gets last like how dare you want to adapt Shakespeare in that way I sort of stand with Sarah and a lot of\nHer arguments just quite a brilliant woman and a lot of the things that she argues not play I did sort of lift from her own writings um so you have written a according to my research uh twenty five is falling players

say about that I'm\nSo as if all your vast ... wasn't a impressive enough plays and movies and TV shows and books you also got a doctorate from Brandeis University a Nineteen eighty nine\nI went back to graduate school and got a PHD in Victorian literature and theater and now I'm really glad I did I you know I'm Glad to know the things I Know I'm Glad to have spent the time I spent studying Victorian melodrama standing Victorian theater studying Dickens you know I\nMean that was before melodrama was used almost only pejorative Lee as it is to yeah\nYou know was the tone it was a very popular form of entertainment everybody went I became fascinated by the fact that it was a\nA culture of theatre goers you know that this theaters were huge and that also that it was a place that all classes came together to watch these plans and how was then a melodrama different from drama the score was called mount drama because everything was musically scored almost all the way through\nAnd it was highly um expressionist stick and gesture all ah there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these tax they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural anticipated movies were trying to be a movie or name where they were it was silent movies go silent existed and also I think you can actually draw the line straight from Victorian melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and\nThere's a kind of ethics sized do a lot of the stories that I I find\nReally powerful and it's very stories centric parents and

there's a kind of contemporary\nRight now move away from it which is there's no question I'm not interested in ... or fractional for or post modern and what's going on here I I don't find that satisfying sometimes I I mean I go to see it and I think well okay\nUm I certainly am a big fan of back at you know the musicality and that deep heart\nAre are things that I respond to a so it's not like I Need a big story to be satisfied in the theater um but uh I Do believe that the action rises out of character and story rises interaction and those are profound truth\nUm and a great place are written on those truth uh and I don't apologize for a good on my deathbed a\nInsisting but there are people who actually criticize your work for being too accessible what I find that mystifying do I do or is it just a general standard issues ... of the\nTwentieth century and now twenty first century well I think that it's a it sounds arrogant toward the audience named which seems contradictory around to form that can't survive without an audience and\nI so I've always felt like I Do want to invite people in to the theater I deeply believe we should all be going to the theater I Want\nTo
