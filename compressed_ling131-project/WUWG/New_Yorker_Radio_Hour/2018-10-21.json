W. W. W. N. G. H. G. Carroll of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network [noise]\n[noise]\n\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan is just a New Yorker radio our production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... or work in Texas\nIn Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nTo candidates who are running as extreme is on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew ... who's been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nAndrew you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbs Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist I've been running for office in the United states of America when did\nWe've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacists have been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what are the origins of it\nIt's never really not existed but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because\nHe posted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he will set for denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that the alliance should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability\nAnd then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe has been saying things like demographics are our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to me and white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to an Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start at the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up than a than black and the protests will be a greater number that whites that America I'll protect their panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make that uh I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables of saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited by Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says we abhor racism\nSo in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the G O P can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel that cannot afford to reject somebody like king\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou've spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're ... fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history that I'm perhaps uniquely so among the countries we're talking about\nDemocracy is a very delicate tricky thing\nIn a dicey racial history that I'm perhaps uniquely so among the countries we're talking about\nDemocracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named ... shoulder to shoulder and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nIs still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district back it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Stewart he was someone who the Virginia GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he he won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the guys that are not part of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa send a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so\nIt's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is at a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremists voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more now most cases than that you have a guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he\nThat of an anomaly I mean you have even more now most cases then that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nUm it was very strange that despite the imposition of the sanctions the Russians didn't do anything in response and so the intel community was trying to figure that out and in the course of that discovered\nThat Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security advisor\nUm had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating a vice president Pence [noise]\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones he knew that\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it suits for black males so what did ... what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn White House White House counsel\n'em and told him that I needed to come see him right away\nTold him what we learned that you know the vice president a bid on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the the pay out there saying this steps\nAnd then as saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the the pay out there saying this up so we told\n'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happened to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back at ... was that different are the same or what it would it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I\nYou know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice as one White House official lies to another and\nTo make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official long to another which\nI Would hope would be concerned about any way but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood and you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with armed again is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issued yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was issues\nNow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending\nThis [noise] so\nHow did you find out about the travel there\nUm I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd get a call I was able to keep one a week and they want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went on line I was reading the New York times and it\nThe whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend I'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House um [noise] what is it that you're trying to do and damned Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban\nWe talked about the different challenges by the constitutional statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation I was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and what troubles me beyond that was that it became clear that\nTo defend the constitutionality of death I was going to have to sit and department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and that did not seem like the ... to me\nBut isn't it usually been job the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued the order or ... years of presidents you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend us\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grounds\nThe appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that [noise] um but not directed apart and not to defend it but here's what's different is that I happen to believe you know Lynn I should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth but the department of justice\nI mean [noise] the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do\n[noise] it's the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what it is true and what his job [laughter] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... [noise] um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside [noise] and that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this [noise] um\nWas like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me at my confirmation hearing about what I Would do if the president asked me to do something that with a mall full are wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even\nIf it's just something that would bring ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and we'll use saying that\nYou're not none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will use saying no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a ...\nYou know we both we had there were communication is going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the directive to the department [noise] and then what happens [noise] um I was fired\n[noise] they were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable\nHired by Donald Trump did that surprise you or ... how did you think the story was going to and once you said you weren't going to allow the travel ban to defend it\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for like probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I Hope that maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nAnd take a breath and look at what they were doing and more ... okay I Know everybody got so bad\nWhat caused him to step back\nAnd take a brash and look at what they were doing and more ... okay I Know everybody's got to know impolite so loud [laughter] in the United states is kind of silly now doesn't it um but [noise] you know I did\nHarbored this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of get in touch 'em there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place [noise] um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired ...\nWhat's your assessment of the whole series of events [noise]\nUm\nI suppose you could say that the president made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's absolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country\nWe'll hear one more conversation from a festival\nMy performance Vincent Cunningham talks with the R B singer\n\nThe New Yorker radio hour is supported by the wall Street Journal providing news and insights about global markets politics tech and the arts\nThe wall Street Journal read them viciously membership options and more information at W.
