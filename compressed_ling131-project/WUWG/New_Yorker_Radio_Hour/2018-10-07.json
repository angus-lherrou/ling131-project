[noise]\nWhat did the specifics tally\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we're getting a very full and detailed view of\nCultures around wells\nWhite fundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free um\nSocial circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on paths tournaments power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIt in your book good and bad you ride very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf\nBut more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter] um this\nIn this country was built and who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter] um this book is in large measure about\nAnger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um [noise] what's that you off on a [noise] um\nIt was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um does take some doing oh God yes [laughter]\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean [noise] I was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and um\nThere's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity [noise]\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been blink or to buy my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer\nAnd there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said about the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to\nPersuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument which is like\nLeaving be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be foolish off you're right I understand and have sympathy you with that like just\nLet them run right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great\n[noise] but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do with also\nSome that that phrase go get your boys that going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work\nOn white women and um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of whiteness in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right\nI I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was like what was my work going to be professional professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is the anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of constructive anger in the book store equate a black woman I'm Shirley Chisholm\nFlorence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till it's not by any coincidence that's not how the smart by accident\nNot at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean up Polly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Mary was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as\nAnd protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nAnd that code decides who we are a guy Raj that story next time on the Ted radio hour from NPR joined us with the Ted radio hour this morning at ten here on eighty eight point five TPP Atlanta\nOh [noise]\n\nAnd [noise]\nThat's Joan Baez singing at the march on Washington Nineteen sixty

recorded by a man named Terri Robinson in two thousand nine with his business partner [noise]\nI Want to raise that seven they've house for your vote to raise their own and they came out just for a minute there's no way I can do it too and I don't say that I just listened fermented\nRobinson's partner was in West Virginia man living in manila Andrew named Jim Stuckey emerge when some of the things stuck he's telling Robinson are kind of extraordinary\nWhat this means that if we can get the money is that we've been talking about taking out the other\nOne million dollars [noise] All right

bullion out of the Philippines where the\nTreasures were said to be in secret locations guarded by poor tribal people now if you're thinking how can I get in on this I should tell you that the story\nIs very much like a number of scams based in the Philippines including some investigated by the U.S Secret Service and Stuckey himself wants to fraud at a bank in Maryland\nRobinson recorded his calls ... suggesting that he might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death he sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of dollars his kids lost their inheritance and his wife lost the house\nCity you know you cannot send that man any more money you're enabling him [noise]\nAnd um [noise] after he died I cannot daddy send him another fourteen thousand and we didn't have fourteen thousand\nTerry Robinson's daughter Maggie was left for the tapes of the phone calls and she began trying to understand how her father who have been so conscious so successful in

underestimate old men they are people who've been con artist their entire life and if you think I have end of life regrets think again I mean I don't think Jim\nIs going to assault but someone else might and not only that she was afraid that Maggie might get conned herself and he's going to talk to you know he's going to seem nice and you're going to say oh like you know maybe he's not such a guy\nOnce that happens and the breach the distance between the two of you that's the moment that objectivity that's why it's always very easy to tell when other people have been caught but the people in the con game in town and we judge them for ...\nYears part two of our story\nWe're about to get on the plane\nPlaying in the mail it to go to Jim\nHow you doing right now right now right now
