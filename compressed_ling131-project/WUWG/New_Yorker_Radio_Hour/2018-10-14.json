S. U. dot edu\nWeekdays on GPS filled with news and information that at night kick back and enjoy the eclectic mix of music from Georgia State university students on album eighty eight eighty eight point five G. P. B. Atlanta\n[noise] from the University of west Georgia his mind be point seven FM Wu WG and W. W. A. G. H. B. Gerald Ford of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network [noise]\nSomeone\nIn Manhattan\nProduction of the New Yorker WNYC studio means will come\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say there's lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is\nIf somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all Sue Halpern has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nSlogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a\nVery very simple Google Search\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections dot Kennesaw dot edu Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this particular searched didn't turn that up instead I found\nA very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be the voter names in some sort of identify or next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data is honest him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nNeed to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not sitting around on line unprotected immediately\nI thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nTotal lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of that plan also found security hole to which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIs Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza for the scariest\nScenario I could think of would be an attacker\nImplanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to\nThe voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nThat attack are true to compromise the Web server to the beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is\nRight around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n[noise] it wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started\nTo trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know\nWhat this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence at the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open [noise]\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts citizen green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot\nAnd then there's also other machines which kept paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nAnd there's also other machines which kept paper about those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot is so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines [noise]\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location\nWhether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that\nProgram here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep angst that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modem [laughter] to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or tacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election\nAnd it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that\nPurge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base\nThis has been a concern for me because\nAnd don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names worn on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nNeed another well\nThis one ... nearly ...\nAnother way\nAnother way\nA loan them see\nGoing to miss the snow\nI'm going to miss the the um the things that grow\n...\n...\nUm miss the um Muslims and I miss you everyone\nIn\nAnother way\nUm [noise]\nI Need to know the play he's\nWell that the\nNeed to know where\nThis one seems nearly ... ...\nI'm going on is the birds\nSing and all this ...\nUm well I'm when\nBeen kissing me so long [noise] another one\nMe so long [noise]\nAnother way\nUm [noise]\nIt's a beauty of beauty isn't it do you ever see we're checking with a known about the songs that they do how much to tease out\nWhat the song is about oh I didn't try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know [laughter]\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nSixties and in many moments in between and\nJust how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up\nAll the stuff I've been through and all the countries don't dictatorships and ah you know I'm In through all that if somebody had said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's ... you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem\nUm and that that is a new normal\nAnd has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning\nAs yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to at law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety\nAnxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial\nThat is great advice yeah and um don't expect much keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because\nAnd um don't expect much keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because\nThis this scene appears in so many documentaries that view singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize and you remind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar your microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen [laughter] it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said [noise] um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know what I'm In that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou mean there's some there's some times that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be a kind of can you have no idea\n[noise] I think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like an aunt you know ... ... people\nAnd so I had a hand then of that this is gonna be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah [noise]\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed\nThat President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a of a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that it's not only is the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song begins a song that lives people off as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses Allen [laughter] um how do you remember that that terrible incident and wants to do this\nTo issue a tweet that depresses how um how do you remember that is that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future this song just dropped out of the sky threatened by the way most for it I did not know and most people didn't know um\n[noise] I Need to tuna didn't get to talk\nI mean if I was the Quaker a tune that you can only be knocking that guitar and you're not getting ear hearing it loudly\nOh go ahead yeah okay\nYoung men came to our house of prayer and they didn't know what brought him\nHe was not\nFriend he was not keen but they open the door\nAnd they let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers the didn't he sat with them many seem to pray\nBut then a young man and kill\nWar and only a\nIn Charlotte and and the month of June ...\nMourners gathered in ...\nPresident came to speak so ...\nAnd the cameras roll\nCould say what must be said\nFor all the living and\nSo on that day and\nHang on raising ... sees\nOf me\n... Mm\nMm Mm\nWe argue wait on the main one man hey our our nation shame some sick mess with a mind oh\nMight be made whoa\nWhat must the\nBall the living and so on that day\nAmazing grace and\nA man thing or a\nHenry was they meticulous planner ruthlessly would only down all his equipment to the beer essential most important uh what's his satellite phone which would allow him to stay in contact with AOL Lee Antarctic logistics and expeditions a company that helped him pull explores on and off the confidence\nChicks\nEach night after a long track your call Eli give them as medical condition and his coordinates if he was ever in trouble could call for when he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world which will be a rescue planes to pull him out\nBut\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of his day which could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling [noise]\nUh which could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] in the school says\nOh\nHe was incredibly good looking oh\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and Wales so that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous and\nCould trust paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nKid recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nFor all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a true remind take kids loved poetry\nHe loved or he\nDid tapestry\nDitched the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nI Love the history of all these old explore as then\n... that lives that his head\nAnd face a fit for [noise]\n\nFor some uh\nAny warship Ernest Shackleton built in many ways was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self to set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would make it back\nFor like\nA bell\nAnd so I Need a decision that always astonished to Henry worse he decided to turn the\nWheel and on\nHis other uh most famous expedition that Shackleton had wanted to walk\nAnd on\nHis other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton\nHad wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great prize to be achieved\nBut before even reached Antarctica his ship the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men more room on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back home alive\nI get to know that they have a very for your time to read from\nFour years old so he's kind of expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery have become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning bells when he came back from a trip to south Georgia just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave [noise]\nIt wasn't until\n... when he was about four day that he does it really took about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly\nWait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole a you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us was huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still he's from fulfilling your an individual dreams\nBecause you fail you have to get permission from the other person and I felt it through in my twenties I had fulfilled or lost\nBecause you fail you have to get permission from the other ... and I felt it through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that looks at some and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shock then was not able to achieve what he wanted to do it alone [noise]\nAs soon as they used to you know the way\nOne time settled on the trail or not I am [noise]\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning and back up his lead this usually took about an hour harness we'll be connected to the blood and you begin to haul the Donald Michael meal\nScreening for Ninety minutes here five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his keys earning as much as eight thousand calories in a day\nBeing craving food cart Banderas double created a steak in a small chip smoked salmon baked potato X Y story\nIf you are you this will work to lean on time can challenge during the day after day there was something almost primal about it is cold warriors\nSingular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was ultimately accomplishment his goal\nNine blonde pole ... because I mean everybody does in some work all day long and southern ... hard one to work for a little bit longer today that I have a ... a good thing everybody Jay Carney one\nGoing you know ... ... but he knows them all there's all I can do them I Would go a day\nHe would crack for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice hip hop will ... to\nTry to develop his ability to read you this morning it was a very tough to say oh there's a breath\nOf life takes girl ... lawyers coach during the day\n[noise] yeah I'm a ... large coach during their own little so much again for the most annoying\nEnough [noise]\nI Do to him a lot [noise]\nWhile he was at that on a satellite\nHarder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people and you can take time to be at the front [noise]\nWhereas if you delete scare criticize miles\nHe found it could take my heart\nFelt constant string of making is mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because\nIn February begins the winter season in a dark to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Aly a shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\n[noise] if you will halt those should be\nAble to go on [noise]\nSo so ...\nSays to them [noise]\nThey were goals record stores are getting on your feet all day ... says to learn to use
