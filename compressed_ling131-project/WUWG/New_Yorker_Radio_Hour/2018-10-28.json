I was a rebellious Christian [laughter]\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records and radio\n[laughter] I didn't have access to musical theater and what did you play as a kid I was Cinderella like totally I we did we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school a Latina\nLatino and black high school and um she's at all the leads to you I didn't actually it's funny when did you not get the lead though is I did not get the whiz I Want it to be Dorothy so\nYou're still mad about it [laughter] I'm\nI'm kind of deal but I understood it but it's\nI did not get the whiz I Want it to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nDon't at what point did you think I can have a big life but something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a may be the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think it registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy and I started to learn more and I started to grow and\nWhen I realized that there was just more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an axis potential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell\nUs your story but we are heroes with utter Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration and I love Judy Garland Judy Garland were were my my my heroes\nAre already different performers why those two\nWomen that I felt really use their voices you knew that a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who\nDid an album and made a career\nFully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not\nHave a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a finger ah she was a producer she was a poly math and that was how one model my career\nAnd know what's your song from an early album called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n\n[noise]\n[noise]

musical why I wanted to do was figure out how I could sing songs [noise]\nHalf concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film when I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspire all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the rights that by\nThe stars happy hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take\nHow can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you

is that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um [noise]\nA a complicated thing which all that you were um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in in the latest album dirty computer\nWhile I think that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me [laughter] that's who I strive to be more like um no so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she\nDoesn't have eagle all the things that make me imperfect she's able to master those\nSo this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used being so critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt oh misunderstood a lot of people will call me we're there'll be like

eighty eight point five\nCome back to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the mid term elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races\nThis may be nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter laws of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania\nAnd what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards and they're\nReally unhappy about it\nOne of the communities launched visited was exton Pennsylvania suburbs of Philadelphia\nActually there's a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we thought Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans\nDaniel ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we're Going Rogue\nOr on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brick and sided with final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door and she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nI have you heard about running for office Danielle joins around you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here than feelings that\nWe had she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and\nUm we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about it impact your life [noise] um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago um pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and with the snow could pipeline and it was only a week old\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago um [noise] a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and with the snow ... pipeline that was only a week old [noise]\nAnd so [noise] I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare [noise]\nLike my babies like burning in their bed\nAnd um [noise] I called them and I said we have to move like have to move we can't [laughter] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless ... um [noise]\nThose things seemed like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [laughter] so you know we're here\nTrying to connect the dots between what's going on politically\nNationally as well as a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics\nJust an example of the egregious now of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory roll back and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occurred to me I just do something\nLike maybe I\nThought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise]\nIt's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five it's Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reached representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed or opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics on the Republican legislature and the Democratic\nUtilities to use eminent domain but here's\nThe thing about Pennsylvania politics for the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline and fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nView of engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest round with the smaller environmental\n... is a private corporation tests that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline moves natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nRight now Daniel Ratcliffe is in a new play called the lifespan of a fact and this may be the only work a theater ever written to give a leading role to a fact checker an injustice I may say that we're all glad to see rectified\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Radcliffe wanted to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at here's Peter can be who runs the fact checking department so they\nKnow Radcliffe showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] and\nHe didn't look unlike under ... and I wondered whether that has something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a factor in a mortal combat where the where the writer\nBecause of because one of one of the [noise] the the citizen [noise] was it is an actual\nThat's where the where the writer\n... because one of one of the [noise] the the set of laws and and the business will sit in like\n... and if I see a as no but if you to differentiate between ... one of the articles of things that my starting to think that\nUm I have sort of gifts for white to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't aren't familiar with the second most exciting things are either factor opinion and we check the facts and when he leaves opinions alone to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion another words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of an art it's kind of a ... there are kind of common sense to court judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make comments that she go judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on on like a ... to have a phone call scheduled but then chef of a Mexican restaurant\nAlive and train them and so what\nI mean the the planet the plan was down there and no red cliffs and check a short restaurant reviewer tables in the ground for two written by hand a gold field herself a former checkers\nShe was very pleased to hear you protect your face [laughter]\nWay he'll she gets yeah I mean it's a short it'd be for restaurant the Mexican restaurant called ... and um when we started a new checker we sit them down where the manuscript and have them under lined up for what they think is ... fact and what's not\n[noise] what do the right to underlined or did they tales from like the the ingredients from the nails\nAnd stuff with the old\nOwn holiday season they succeed the seasoning and so then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both stew off the website and then check was chef yes and who your goal is set up with a dull Evan\nGroup violence going to say that room [noise] ... [noise]\nNever heard of it as it is similar to the beaches soupy I was Sheila do also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment of Mary would back off it may get into yeah yeah yeah I guess\nLike lava kind of ... yeah well ... yeah well we're ...\nWe're so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach is that like the problem\nThe laws are coming up yeah well ... yeah well we want because\nWe're so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach is that\nThe problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a vendor speak for some reason he defended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like a California speech just fed like um [noise]\nAfter you're done with this will set up a job interview she wrote a switch careers\nLike they may have a much easier to pressure\nAfter I saw that Daniel ... I've had a good from of course grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner from work with Parker Henry another ... one of my deputy\nHigh dollar diamond anyhow I talked to a lot of gay when\nYou marry them on the\nFirst national park or and Daniel when they come on her website where they looked at a news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right on the phone yeah yeah I\nDon't know I was ... when I got to look at California for everyone it's called we're seeing is I'm a bomb\nYou know where I\nThink so because Parker and Daniel ... go has the Venice Beach body doesn't mean that that's the way the chef at any point in Moscow and describe it yeah I Know it's a bit of a ... in the Iowa\nState so I don't know like how are you in fact\nYou frame it like you have no idea that potentially have access to hum yea playing down his key density\nActually on the eleven o'clock college fast approaching okay the kid on speaker phone in the library on my cell phone\nHi Justin I'm Down to the New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to an office\nHi Justin I'm Down to a New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to an ... system some questions about as a review of of your restaurant and I'm just trying to fact check it and make sure everything's accurate\nYeah of course\nFirst off you'll surname is that's about a\nB.
