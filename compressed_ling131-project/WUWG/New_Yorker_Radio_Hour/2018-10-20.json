L. W. W. W. W. A. G. H. B. Gerald Ford did Georgia Public broadcasting radio network\n[noise]\nHas a\nOne world Trade Center in the New Yorker radio our production of WNYC Studios and the New York I\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... rock in Texas\nIn Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates were running as extreme is on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew ... who's been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nAndrew you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... which for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbs Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lower we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacists had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what are the origins of it\nIt's never really not existed but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nVoted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he ... he denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that the alliance should exist\nSo what is what is Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King as a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe has been saying things like demographics are our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere is no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to me and white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat too doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff\nBut he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism well let's talk about what we're talking about\nBut he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats then adding up as panic than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number there whites that America I'll protect their panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nOr I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables of saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is their guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like paying\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't we weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety where the extremely a dicey racial is\nWalls of the United states that we we we are extremely flawed society where the extremely a dicey racial history that I'm perhaps uniquely so among the countries we're talking about\nDemocracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee\nThat they want to vote for the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king case still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district back\nDeep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Stewart he was someone who the Virginia GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he he won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the countries that are not part of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa send a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so\nIt's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is at a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremists voices yeah I think he\nThink the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more now most cases then that you have\nParty standing up to some of its extremist voices\nYeah I think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases then that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nAnd in the course of that discovered\nThat Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser\nUm had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating a vice president Pence\nWent out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then\nProviding false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that the Russians knew that too [noise] and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it so it's a black belt so what does what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn White House White House counsel\n'em and told him that I needed to come see him right away told him what we learned that\nYou know the vice president of bid on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn\nEither way I told him what we learned that you know the vice president have been on face the nation and as saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he has a shirt that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the the pay out there saying this up so we told\n'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happened to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd you go see him a second time on January twenty so he asked me to come back ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I ... you know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice as one White House official lies to another\nWhat did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official long to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about any way but that it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again\nIt's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem and we also thought you know the vice President Pence within title to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood and you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seven so on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him and link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending\nThis [noise] so how did you find out about the travel there\nUm I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport and get a call I was able to keep one a with may want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so [noise]\nYou know the airport and get a call I was able to keep one a week and they want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says that after you left you know I went on line I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and I'm Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and spent a very long time in there I'm Talking through\nWhat the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges constitutionally and statutory early and otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation I was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was that it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to sit and department of justice lawyers and to take that position\nAt this travel ban that applied just the Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and that did not seem like the ... to me but isn't it\nUsually been job of a department of justice to defend actions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued the order or ... years of presidents you're the executive branch's lawyers lie to why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend us\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grounds\nThe appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that [noise] um but not directed apart and not to defend it but but here's what's different is that I happen to believe you know let it get should go into court and make an argument that it's not grounded in troops but the department of justice\nI mean [noise]\nNo ... should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in ... at the department of justice [noise] I mean\nThe OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted in ... [noise] um but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside and that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um\nLike just the head of the civil division or oh you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me at my confirmation hearing about what I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was on mall full are wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even\nIf it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and we'll use saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nThat we thought we had there were communications going on at levels below knee and between me and Mr McGahn and I actually the directive to the department [noise] and then what happens [noise] um I was fired\nIs [laughter] [noise] they were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable\nHired by Donald Trump did that surprise you or ... how did you think the story was going to and once you said you weren't going to allow the intro man to be defended\nLook I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for which I probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I Hope that maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nIn this context but I Hope that maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nAnd take a brash and look at what they were doing and more ... okay I Know everybody got to know why so loud\n[laughter] in the United states the kind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I did\nHarbored is hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of get in touch 'em there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place [noise] um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired ...\nWhat's your assessment of the whole series of events [noise]\nUm\nI suppose you could say that the president and made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's absolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country\nWe'll hear one more conversation from a festival\nLive performance Vincent Cunningham talks with the R B singer\nNo ... no one of the game went on\n\nNew Yorker radio hour is supported by the wall Street Journal providing news and insights about global markets politics tech and the arts\nThe wall Street Journal read ambitious lay membership options and more information at W.

month that the New Yorker festival I was really fun to talk to the R. and B. singer ...\nMusic it was wonderful mix little town uh sometimes it's losing you along the lines of trip pop more electronic uh time she sounds like a mind these vocalist along the\nLines of Janet Jackson [noise] you know\nIn her musing points to someone who really understand and appreciate new\nSources of her own music and

much for being here with us for the nineteenth New Yorker festival and for the call [noise]\nI have immense respect for any singer performer anybody who goes with just the first name as a power move as far as I'm concerned [laughter]\nCan you do how did you decide you know how you wanted to present yourself that did that way\nWell I was really committed to the full name calling and stuff I I really wanted to be known first and last mhm and everybody was like\nA lot less distinct enough and and they're going to run into some people try to search her name is\nVery strong from this angle I just because I Know he grew up in the DC area and then there was a thriving culture music or the things you are listening to ivy we're starting to perform and um to to start writing songs crowded out while those influences come together\nUm you know it's it's really weird because you know [noise]\nI feel like I'm grown up in a really it's an intersection experience you know there's a lot of things going on at the same time you know I have a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants is African immigrants particularly bad ass\nThere is a lot of things going on at the same time you know I'm I'm a daughter of immigrants of African immigrants East African immigrants particularly if he opens\nAnd then there's the layer of growing up in a suburb of DC I'm [noise] I'm being bussed from a you know ghetto suburb\nTo white or sober and what that means you know um there's a particular way that you're processing the world when your school is extremely segregated I Would say that's the case for everybody but yeah there's a way it was happening in my school\nSo I was listening to a lot of different things you know I was obsessed with with armed be any harm the local ... was just so it was like zero those home base and I would say before that I was listening to jazz and and world music and just you know a lot of traditional music\nAnd then I remember my ex boyfriend my first boyfriend had a Napster membership one of the first phone\nCall and I got down there in the divorce you know\nI kept that membership for a few years to survey every\nFemale vocal period I was just on a mission to just scan the world for every single type of thing and so I just wouldn't learn music and other languages but mainly jazz scene and I was a thing that I was sort of serving the most and\nUm so you know I've had different periods where I was just\nImmersed in one sound um and then after that it was sort of a really experimental music you know so like China and experimental music\nWhen I think about my experimental electronic music side allowed those references are still in black because I'm thinking about Jimmy Jam and Terry Louis or I'm thinking about what was the comments or you know I'm just\nNow famous or Herbie pervious\nWhat was it about or and be admitted sort of the\nMore the drugs for ...\n... some pool on you [noise]\nUm I guess it was just pop music that was you know there's a way that you know\nYou can't there's there's no come around every around\nUm jazz when you get to your elementary school [laughter]\nYou can't there's there's no come round Henri around\nUm jazz when you get to your elementary school\n[laughter] job for them now where you want to be around me out and get the kindergarten and people like you know ... you know\nThat I'm so I'm yeah I think that
