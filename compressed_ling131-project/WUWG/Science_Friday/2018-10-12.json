the structures of their societies and brainy way that they navigate their world\nAs by next guest has a new to stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday saying she was great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood as one of the first animals went into space wow what got you fascinated with study though\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months and I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I\nBecame fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years they are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow so how many do you study how many there are group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a ... that my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nI Do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome score one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out okay\nGive me a typical day and the life\nA squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping\n[noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [noise]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until seven\nFor their prayer or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshopper sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd with the head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it [noise]\nWow [laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch mess right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I've actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is\nThey will approach a ... a a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the ...\nThe the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nCrafts pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those last leaving so right\nYeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of of of of other one big spider monkey let's let's hear that clip [noise]\n\n\nThe other one of the spider monkey sweats let's hear that clip [noise]\n\n\nGrow monkey spider monkey everybody does it ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I didn't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver but when there is you know ten of them in a treats kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\n\n[noise] okay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there is an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there it's a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that that's so sad that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nMy ... ... it might be birds actually because hormones you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of score monkeys [noise]\nInstead of ... and how hard was it how much time as it taking you to know the difference in to study this hour they make [noise] so it's\nNot something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or [noise] but um my field assistant who is\nUm it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but uh my field assistant who's a local field assistant\nHe's the monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys how long have you been doing that for a little longer he started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing it for about Twenty years\nFrom a monkey whisper yeah well the caller yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] or anything that we can learn about the human language or evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey [noise]\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming

go on the most important journey of their lives after living years\nIn the wild wild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth\nAnd then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a compost is just telling you wearing north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more north east\nEast than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their land dwelling cousins and when you're let fish living quiet landlocked blinds you know they lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that math\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant at Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but sandman living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles to their journeys tech\n[noise] it's pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\nFan and they usually actually using these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there [noise] that is correct [laughter] they don't just have to navigate ups she may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\n[noise] in the same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic Journey Through the wages that they use something more broad scale and and the term we think they're using magnetic nap and they make information\nNow I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you [noise]\nSearches looking at a different group of Sam be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals\nThat were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never set than outside of a leak or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\nI knew a Jew around but they still have these magnetic maps in there that they would have needed that they not been laying bar that's correct and our neighbor to retain these in one that's an interesting\nQuestion a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nFor also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSuper convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel form of type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them [noise]\nTo their ... and the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species of tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells\nAnd the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic field\nThese chains of tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields and so changes in both the field strings and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nDo these ... structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nStory one important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields while it's\nA rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map than\nJust a point of curiosity and\nWe also wanted to know um\nIf it land examine also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that does that make maps of diverse amount of no amount of the states\nBut we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field\nBut to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nAnd so how did you go about testing research [noise]\nSo and the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ battery Research Center where they were weird and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that it allows us to alter the direction and also the am preach of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nSo what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnetized the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up too\nIn a certain direction so that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction [noise]\nIf there were present them with magnetic field essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of night on tight right that somehow connect within ourselves\nAnd and so having a fish respond to this [noise]\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials [noise]\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north [noise]\nWow that's terrific and and you know do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how to how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields [noise] that\nIs a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale to Maine which of those maps as yeah\nSo what so speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at Maine magnetic resolution of this map so having the theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "12"}
