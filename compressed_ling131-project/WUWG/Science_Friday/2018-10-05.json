[laughter]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah yeah we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but bad detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that were uh\nWay so far is using this thing called the trends that method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see a gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this like some of them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to the moon\nSays no that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right why did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and there's the famous thing goes external thing and it's a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for the signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making and wobble around a those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations\nAnd uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying moons there but because it is such a ... an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confront\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes here that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this very sure yeah yeah you\nSo we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with the Kepler and they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration\nThere wasn't enough to make a claim uh so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event ah we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple data sets for multiple telescopes ah to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the one ... gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope ... a better for you guys were looking ... ...\nThe hell why for spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror uh and I'm sitting all whereas ... orbit the earth ah when we performed this observation you know you can imagine ... staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single war but ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go around so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out ... uh James don't ... won't have that problem\nAnd like you say the ... going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long\nThat you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this telescope was going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly more the time so we're gonna have to\nA very good case [noise] you know there ... another edition\n... the wrong word but they're all everything is always obsolete by the time he gets built the highway or something else that makes some law what made it twice as big what you're saying whatever ... sure yeah you\nKnow ... there's other telescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now too well ... we've talked about uh W. first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's ah\nAh I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's uh ultra violet and read and optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and so uh they they come up with great uh names for these things are said there's gonna be some ... test against ... stadium Estee will definitely be an an improvement and horrible\nBut you know ... boys over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it truly amazing\nIdiots and I'll tell you this is ...\nOn Hubble but you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it truly amazing\nIt is I'm All right so if this is a strange star planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary\nSolar system planet situation that's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here\n\n\n\n\n\nFor glum about how food safety protections came to be a topic of her new book\nThe Korean squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for\nEight to five five I'm let's turn out the clock back to that time period ... or ... you have an entire chapter on catcher [laughter]\nSo and after ... while you're devoted why I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is a catch it as just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrutiny for a century idea of catch up which is kind of a sick tomato paste kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of than nasty\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called tower dies and then because the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and like sodium bizarre way\nWhich is actually still with us today and so this book capture pick this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair and in this case I really love the story because [noise]\nIt makes the point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch if we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we may or not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food they're afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something\nIf they are the things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that you know there was major combat over the preservatives and gets her and that was pretty fascinating\n[laughter] that's supposed to talk about a A R B Washington where I was a little bit more than the focus of your book on the corner squad I'm\nActually started for people volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that because what the point is wise did get those amazing [noise] it's just\nCrazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees a mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from a very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison quote squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at ... which is a cleaning product he looked at salary silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept were rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did\nBut they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems and because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname is the poison squad his his front page news all across the country here food is\nAnd I was American newspapers [noise] it was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad his his front page news all across the country here food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but [noise]\nThat's so ... he had some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety you know\nThat's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also in like ten or a preacher conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in\nFrom the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk be far more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying [noise]\nI'll say okay I'm testing these on young healthy people boat about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on\nFor a long time [laughter] that could take a drink of water I darn [laughter] there you go um [noise]\nHe has this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nShe really means promote the general welfare in your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation at our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his [noise]\nBut changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his [noise] crusade nor did Congress actually put teeth and ... and things like that [noise]\nUm so after you know he's like battling always stymied by Vince ... Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug act of Nineteen oh six past somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was ... and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection laws ever passed by the federal government\nAnd so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "05"}
