I felt that um and just out there like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute and a lot of ways to measure when did you think\nAbout a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to have it movie made a tit\nFor throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nOf her jewelry to the ... ...\n... what we want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal where you take anything\nBut I had a choice I think we're\nI think that's a real quote you meant you know right I did I did I met him once I'm at a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way when I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flawed movie but it's really great movie\nI really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak the engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we need to his communicated really affected me was he as reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps dour as portrayed in the movie\nA year in a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about a\nA you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues announced thrown off the so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\nOr you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the ...\nAnd but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter] you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that requires concentration and that was and\nThen as your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like that was a fair portrayal of any engineer [noise]\nI think if engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer and there was a very serious ones they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair trial because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult called the scenes of space flight where they had been Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting anytime we saw people flying though ... says you'd was that realistic Pew\n[noise] I think that a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this\nOn floating feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room that you were really crammed in there the cockpit right in your faith the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride that pill can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nThat is go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday [noise]\nHow high high Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment [noise] um yeah I was saying it just as soon as you mentioned in the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans took space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nThanks for calling you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seed you know to go landing on the ...\nI think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there are I mean there were other candidates for the job\nThe for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous missions\nAnd I was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success or failure in that sense but a fantastic a moment\nThe kind of really kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success or failure in that sense but a a fantastic moments captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very hard to say I'm a big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the last so the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know ... Apollo one whatever\nYou think these human ... lost to shape history has has played out\nOf it [noise] well I mean these things or if I was I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they had been at\nSupport for ... comes from generous listeners like you and Callaway resort in gardens Georgia's authentic outdoor escape offering to championship golf courses the scenic Lakeview course and the mountain view course\nTwelve time host of the PGA Buick challenge Morris Callaway Gardens dot com and Ogle Thorpe University in Brookhaven working to make a private college education possible for more families in Georgia complete information on their new flagship fifty program is available at ... dot edu or\nAn entire family worked at the same auto plant in Michigan until it closed during the recession what somebody in your life you know with unemployment near record lows what does the recovery look like to them\nLike a fantasy world or something in an area I'm Ari Shapiro in Michigan views of the economy and the midterms this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News four\nTo seven on your porch five keep your laughter and GPS news dot org\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking about Neal Armstrong as portrayed in the new movie first man from the personal hardships the astronaut overcame to be jarring dizzying process of astronaut training to have that story led to all the missions and since that time forget it\nIt's the astronaut over came to be jarring dizzying process of astronaut training\nTo have that story led to all the missions and since that time ...

I Believe was some kind of Netflix theories about about them all says some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nSam ... and all the people who are in the control room and all the other places and you know all kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting uh this this is a movie about the roads have astronaut certainly fifty years ago and\nIt will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff wires Hollywood still talking about things that happen fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I think part of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big staff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that that shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible it's like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep well that people keep coming back to because of that\nUh and that that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told you more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots shouldn't should get their view\nOf it when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and there are other places\nAnd you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for there are so many other asked if there are so many countries up there right now\nI mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russian sort of thing that will be a\nAn epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're [noise] Boulder travails and difficulties and\nWe started like in many ways to make her into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are\nInstant and they are into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those\nAre sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think maybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back roads with imagining the future is your what are they talking about it now these days about [noise]\nI don't well what are big project is actually trying to get back to the moon and so that's a deer Ryan at the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering and how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to\nTell what it takes to actually get to the flight ... for the astronaut to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um the engineers actually tried to stop a lawn chair and a pen and fortunately that did not happen\nUm and it in the affected them in ways that many people did though of course it expects to kill the crew but oh I think that many of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nIf I could point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is some plans to make a movie about the challenger mission [noise] um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nDecisions made a the the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and ah\nI'm I'm and I'm sure there'll be some crucial to understanding the accident\nYou know you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get us back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today that was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's just\nIt's hard to do 'em dead amount of uh\nIt's the one drop from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do 'em dead amount of a prop waning when Neal said he wished for more ...
