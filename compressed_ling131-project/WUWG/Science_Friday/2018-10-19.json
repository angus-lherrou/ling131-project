I started to many PHD in two thousand six which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I sort of fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them and\nCompared to only bees bumblebees have a very different flights article right out of the colonies gets started\nA first honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lived in the life of a hobby queen or she's living on her own\nBut bumblebees are different and um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony\nAnd he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens half to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own death that they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and this sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nBroaden their shores for what they look\nLike I did yes you'll notice from the get go than it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest the way that they led\nTo protests roaming the meanwhile honeybees are\nHappen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they ... the way that they led\nTo protests roaming the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time\nRight yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be right\nWell I consider honeybees is a ... and ... actually said he's ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to hoarding pay roughly ... home\nYou're ... Jarvis harvester from I'm here in California I Would like to see on the sidewalk slightly larger than what you'd say are a little bit longer\nThere but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk\nThere and why why are you interested in the\nCity there and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between us sites so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest egg determines how quickly they forward and how quickly they called her friends to food sales and everything I brought here as a cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head also\nWould hang it was like that that's a cast of an answer is yes it was like pouring plaster Paris\nExactly five star players from Home Depot\nHow far does that go down as just the whole length I Know that's just the top part about six or eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but he could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did one ... um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to be around and it won't break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to sell and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of fraud so that determines how they can go to\nOur house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee is what about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nThe drones the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important too\nThe drones so the ... the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething ... that when I was reading about this and whether it was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called loyal jelly but that's not what the bumble bee do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nBut we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your own and flip star runner were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nHi um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could extract the DNA from the bees and use it to like help or he'll her when she gets style\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to back\nUp resorting to work with and you're allergic\nSo I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me too\nAnd does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I bet there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question no longer and it's also live in big groups with the queen how were they are large different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and\nIn big groups where the queen Howard there are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of defense so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences and first of all many of them live underground raised bees will and put\nHives inside of fame treat cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example both honeybees in some species advance will relocate from one site to another so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will also there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places are there some somebody's in some differences\nI think the size of the one thing there is some species that have am colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so leaf cutter\nSupport for CPB comes from you our listeners\nAnd metro Durham PC providing skin cancer detection

plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience statistics about sleep in the United states among other countries are in great\nFewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... thing but it is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back to the table Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los\nAngeles [noise] [noise]\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is\nYes for um the majority of long term studies that are looked have found that if you get significantly less significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night van that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime and a lot of trouble [noise] yeah 'cause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that stamp\nDog is not going to ... in all honesty\nI'm In the six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually before\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term so many of you may stay up to my it after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids not getting enough sleep\nThe first are what we consider the short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here he may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things\nYou may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke\nAnd diabetes not mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nInterestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do oh what\nDoes it what about sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours that quality what what one of the genes\nDo that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nUm the the time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but I also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep are not in our brains they're not in our heads they're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed\nIn the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study beam all one is expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have analyzed so meanwhile one is what's known as a clock Jane\nIn that I focused on in my most recent study beam on one has expressed and the majority of tissues in which we have ... one is what's known as the clock same clocks in every cell in your body very real\nRises o'clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it has to be an ... and the\nMechanism like gears I talked to my students about ... on the ... most of them don't know what a clock years or so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism\nThat allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body had these clocks and we know that these costs regulate sleep\nFor a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we look primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep and more importantly how to recover from sleep loss and when do you mean how to recover so\nThe mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it's kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the ... goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these work similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it's set to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep [noise]\nUm for a long time we suspected that the ... mechanisms are more involved and the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is is that the\nThe circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down at night um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting\nIs the allergy so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nComes to light Bangkok will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that it's a really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're\nSpeaking of the cells so mapping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by ear so all I Do agree one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon\nI won't complain right at all I Know what I was researching what you're saying nothing is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily suspiciously and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nHour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy or if you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping that goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much so that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping\nIs driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either directly right that's why I don't try to understand but that just moved back to where it let me go to the questions on his side yes", "show_name": "Science
