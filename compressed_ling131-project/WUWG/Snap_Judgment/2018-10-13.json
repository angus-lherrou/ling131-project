riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across as logging get across the river\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand in ... when the rock and he was terrified and it was rocking on his blog\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand\nI was trying really really hard to establish that connection that just what I wanted to even if you didn't need and I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\n... reached out and they gave me his rifle\nAnd I was like well even better [noise]\nSo I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed Abdul hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like paradise\nI can asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns in like the triumphant moment and they like padding among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause that we were totally on their side\nOf the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and I pray and they mind their own business\nBut there is this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy they like to insult president for life\nThey're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were found is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplain to John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was getting it on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might say even though we are seeing them murders somebody I very much saw\nThem as victims of circuits\nActors as evil as you might say even though we are seeing that murder somebody I very much saw\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways I specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same and you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashing the schools are\nDown there next with sticks the Dow Jones their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and a jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and I'm of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others huh\nMm as they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters bare split on now is only two countries with guns to for climbers they walk and walk for a whole night invested for a day and then did again they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time\nWhere we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nWe start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asked what time it was and we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one Tommy change completely [noise]\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief worst super sore from chattering all the time but they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better and then it\nSore from chattering all the time but they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they get off the communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd still seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nRight and he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nTo one of the climbers to continue up the mountain\nAlong with only one of his men as gardening and that one guard was to\nHe kind of a weird way we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together it's somewhere there was said\nAnd obviously meant that he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to undo\nBought a hook line and sinker\nSo I grabbed his arm in Baghdad Denali\nServed pleading with him not to go back\nIn danger is out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to go see he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up till tracking down towards the Base Camp\nWill Jason and his crew lets to up the mountain\nI saw like my rib cage was going to explode there was just as a\nBall of excitement there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife and here are like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun was for other kids I completely changes everything oh\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of threat especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\nUm\nTo each other that the game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find\nThe the game on and this was going to happen and we all started to kind of moving up that mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find [noise] and I'm trying to always\nKind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\n... and you could tell that they were there like this is a moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't um\nI stopped on a small ledge ... and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we just don't believe\nAnd killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of the main thing and we're raising up the class I just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nI think the surgeries have at times exacerbated\nSome of those negative traits that I mentioned the content gross part [laughter]\nBoom boom here's what they did in ... he support me after the second operation government means they're carrying this man [noise] um [noise] then that's different is manifesting my personality [noise] um\nI always knew that he had medical issues and then obviously to branch surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I because [noise] fourteen at the time ... something like that for you is this huge brothers spent\nAnd while stewardess states or brittle spend you know like everyone and his family to me all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors [noise] listen to the way he talked about mountain biking\nAnd it's been two is known for everyone and his family to be all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI like that I can just known out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead crunch revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you kind of\nYou know you had a source of joy and you're just like find down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy and\nOne day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old and\nThen through started getting headache to\nVery terrible headache\nAnd he was diagnosed with an al formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mouth formations because here's what's\nCrazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another on what Spencer's brings a Jewish and didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought\nThe surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when center became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery [laughter] no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I was about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of ah just\nStarted coming out of the surgery as we're totally different person I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person until I was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nThe change is enormous\nLike there's a story of a playboy model became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take her picture\nOr is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nShe's worried that if you change too\nAnd in general brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nShe's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how\nI turned out [noise] and everything was all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nAnd your approach too risky surgery is a country ...\nEven help you\nMove there was a conversation I had with him at some point\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgery is because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day to\nTime to\nRemain at third to him or\nOne of my biggest regrets surgeries and ... my surgeries on\nMade me a lot to do some more\nMen are ... times [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCan I get a little ... fits all its optical with you
