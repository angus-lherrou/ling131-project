not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across as logging get across the river\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employment when the rock and he was terrified and it was rocking on his blog\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand\nI was trying really really hard to establish that connection as to why I wanted to even if you need me to hand out one I never have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\n... reached out they gave me a rifle\nI was like well even better [noise]\nI'm Sorry I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy smiling from Erie patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like Penn and among the shoulder and they're like little dog like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know are kept\nThey are and they're like sold like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between captors enough completely changed at that moment they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOr the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little stay up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they ... they might not our business\nIs a there is this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy feel like you saw president for life\nThey're not allowed to freely study their religion and\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nIt was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\n... find a job that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was getting it on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nSort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might say even though we're seeing them murder somebody\nVery much saw them as victims of circumstances where the specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day she was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that\nIt is especially with a guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same and you know doing the same thing he was doing but\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashing the schools are\nOut there next with sticks the Dow Jones their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and I'm of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm as they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters bare split on now is only two countries with guns to for climbers only walk and walk for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up and just really good game to play to pass the time\nWhere we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nWe start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely [noise]\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth for super sore from chattering all the time but they just felt unbelievably long\nDid have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive that don't seem to have no idea\nSleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive that do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal right\nAnd he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain\nAlong with only one of his men as gardening in that one guard was to\nHe kind of a weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was saying\nAnd obviously a myth that he has the story that I spent a week selling to learn\nAnd bought a hook line and sinker\nSo I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali\nServed pleading with him not to go\nTo injure is out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want him became shot and he was asked Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go me he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp\nJason and his crew led to up the mountain\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there just as\nBall excitement so there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife and era move like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything oh\nThis was a very early climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since there was the middle of the night and so\nJohn and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that the game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find and I'm trying to always\nKind of direction to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd I'm trying to always kind of direction to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\n... and you could tell they were there were like just at the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't um\nI stopped on a small ledge ... and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we can do and will be\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of Maine and were raised and got the class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nBut I think the surgeries have at times exacerbated\nSome of those negative traits that I mentioned the content Chris part [laughter]\nBoom boom here's what I'm saying then [noise] the support me off in a second operation mend means if not carrying this myth [noise] um [noise] and that's definitely the manifest in my personality [noise]\nUm I always\nKnew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to branch surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I because [noise] more chain at the time ... something like that there's this huge brothers Spencer\nAnd while Stewart is these are brutal spend you know like everyone and his family to be all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors [noise] listen to the way he talked about mountain biking [noise]\nLike that I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down don't really like look ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you kinda\nNo no and just focus on peddling dropped my head down don't really like crunch revolving just felt like one to hold on to something like that you turn to\nYou know you had that sense of joy and you're just like find down it\nAnd then too was always happy and healthy and\nOne day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old and\nThen through started getting headache to\nVery terrible headache\nAnd he was diagnosed with now formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mal promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another but ... didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought\nThe surgery could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when it's been two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer banking system that when that he never have surgery [laughter] no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way out there about ... about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of ah just\nStarted coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person simply would scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nThe change is enormous\nLike there's a story about playboy model became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take your picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nShe's worried that if you changed the green you changed him\nSo\nI think for Spencer seeing I turned out [noise] everything was them\nSo I think\nFor Spencer seeing how\nI turned out [noise] and everything was them all men are familiar made him very hasn't then there should be some amount of skepticism\nAnd your approach term [noise]\nRisky surgery and sing country treasure [noise]\nEven if they help you\nMove there was a conversation I had with him at some point\nExpressing from my regret about my own store dreams because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery ...\nAlmost every day all the time to\nRemain there to him the [noise]\nOne of my biggest regrets surgeries and my surgeries and\nMade me a ... times [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCan I get a little bit less optical with you especially\nIn front [noise] okay [noise]\nUm [noise] so in like queuing it story with Amy\nI'm binge pushed to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that same term is by our brain\nFor something less physical\nAnd I wonder your thoughts are my only problem in line the intersection of all of those things are more\nFair [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to their we spend with having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle when we first\nArrived at the hospital my husband and I and Spencer was just talking about are the British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as ivy and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I\nI thought we would lose them [noise]\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and\nI thought we would know than\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from
