our food regulation\nAnd a lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of these peanut butter wars was trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and that quickly becomes an exit central question even if you think it's a really simple question at the beginning\nBefore we dive into peanut butter checking with reporters and she really was it at the bus station in Tel Aviv to get great Peter\nHow are you\nI'm good how are you good um what started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large bus station two and a half million square feet there we will start the story there\n[noise] okay so I'm Saturdays and Tel Aviv are pretty slow days most people including foreign workers have a day off to a day of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach and the bus station it's pretty much shut down\nExcept for the fourth floor which transforms into sort of a little manila\nThere is a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers I stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturday [noise] how many minutes are coming here you know the\nThey are eating some deep you know they got these are setting here [noise]\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up at the bus station\nAround noon they'll bring these like huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of\nDesserts um and they set up these tables in the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see an Israeli grocery store um we'll all be like stocked up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have this in your foods but they also come to hang out with friends and\nWe'll all be like stocked up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have these familiar foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going in to chat about work and life in Israel and life away from their families in the Philippines\nOver the next Fifteen or twenty minutes all set up properly but\nThat will help the other thing you have to check his course Robin temperature but you know you waited till I was fully set which means it'll be overcooked by the time it comes out Sarah I'm no I agree I agree I think Chris you're probably right quick question how many eggs and how much buttermilk how much sugar\nThree large eggs in one cup of that or not I didn't decrease the sugar a little bit I took a quarter and a little bit less than a waiver spray also wondering how much to share this is how ...\nWhat happens on a call in show like this everything's fine until about five minutes they call and tell me what happened I cooked it over my barbecue ... on the Senate fitted over well you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect or something like a custard pie\nBecause of the chemistry so go back and use the racial amounts and take it out when it goes to the center\nIf that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out it especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's very delicate chemistry\nOur files certainly try that says thank you so much for your and we'll see what happens now ... thank you\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a cooking failure a complaint or if you just

Logan, Ohio Hi Ryan what is your question today\nWell my question is about love and next to ... a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was a fun\nSo we were trying to make at home and we did not have I guess it's going Lyme so\nWe're trying to use what ashes and we weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if you guys [noise] at any answers\nI go to Amazon and get the rights tough to get it to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of one and I mean what do they do with it now yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nThey by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn you're growing for this right field corner like the kinds of field corn I mean it used to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety I Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint core and like something you know what you are or\nPoland or we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult to make money so that the colonel's we're a little bit smaller and points you heard about ...\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] I mean you're you know you just don't understand this you're doing this because it's an idea of perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing they want to try to do right right\nI think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better way to at home fresh compared to like using Moscow her you know like the stuff he at the store that's dried\nNo I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boy my mixture pouring off get rid of the ... boiling some four hours so I think we just had that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made here's a thought\nThere's some wonderful our kids know companies that make ... and ... finance and mills isn't it ... I wouldn't be\nThe thought there is so wonderful are cheese no uh companies that make ... and ... corner finance and mills is a it's an John ... I wouldn't be surprised if you called the ban some males and asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you and then a good call one of the companies and just order some awesome\nI think this is Larry do want to do was that would be my best suggestion even though both of us were hippies back in the day we weren't trying to get our own or with Brian thank you so much yeah raise questions about oh I Hope you find the answer\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to mistreat radio hosts and Christopher [noise]\nComing up next my conversations are\nChatting with her about the secret history of peanut butter after the break [noise]\n\nSupport for Christopher ... milk street comes from regal where makers of Nineteen Nineteen cookware cooking happens in the kitchen but life happens around the kitchen table American stainless and non stick cook Ware learn more at Nineteen Nineteen cookware dot com\n[noise]\nRecently supported gp during our fall fund drive thank you were already putting your dollars to work to bring you the programs that matter to you on the beach if you didn't get a chance to donate during the drive your online contribution now will still make a difference [noise]\nPlease take a couple of minutes to go to G.

is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter grandma [noise] of course the area I'm great thank you\nSo it was still starts the late fifties people are manufactured peanut butter that's not all payments rent\nYeah often and significant amount not peanuts ah at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that are\nThere or in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is that the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things doesn't really matter [laughter] well I think that is a\nBig question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a\nCrisco there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter]\nAt the just plant it was up to twenty percent Chris coat and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks described it as if it wasn't a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream\nJobs are really doesn't ... doesn't sound like a great concept so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial dues tell us about it and how that happened and why does it happen and and\nHow upset were people yeah well it all kind of comes\nDown to this one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are aiding nice peanut butter sandwiches mostly and here they just peanut flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined a woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nFood in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming that was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant a\nAnd so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mention that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter\nAnd uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into the jar of peanut butter that she was buying she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and\nAnd muscle is just a bunch of spices essentially\nThat's right so in this case we start with onions are near uh really stressed the importance of the onions here and we cook them for about Fifteen minutes until their golden brown so that really adds a lot of sweetness today dish I mean he's a combination of fresh\nSpices and ground spaces here so fresh cilantro stands and ginger whole cumin coriander and yellow mustard seeds and then to American tire and that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds to tell you can kind of smell those spices\nLove about this is that the American vegetables in games are kind of bland they weren't like the centerpiece all you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I add those yellow split keys to the dish those are really thick and creamy he's serving over rice west\nThat ... dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I\nAdd those yellow split keys to the dish those are really thick and creamy he's serving

New York\nThe roaster the more expensive one and here's the problems first of all a lot of smoke\nSo you have to do it underneath a load of some ... ... New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans at a different roasting time and temperature and said very complicated to get a roast right because otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and ... says problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than she was worse than beans I could just lie\nAt the local allow or may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right to get the roasting the flavor right\nYou know the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time [noise] I never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go down ... well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way\nTo go well unless bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nOn that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these great though I think it's great to maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something easy\nTo go and spend three or four hundred dollars and got it wrong and I get hot bath and we found is second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter roast like medium roast getting the the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky so anyway there you go\nSo much okay Brandon thanks for calling calling already there\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher ... give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eighty five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email questions milk street\nRadio dot com welcome to the street who's calling Hi this is Han Casey how can we help you today\nAnd you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook by one week and I think it's a dessert wine that had like\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have let this happen to deal with the ... thing and I think the decoration presentation all of that I Try a lot of ... if you get home from my own ... and I\nThink but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out ... ... and then I tried that cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't look\nWhat happened to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it at room temperature I always feel like it clumps up and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good for things and I think that home\nSo I agree with you that the powdered sugar ice getting pretty ... yeah I really don't you gonna like orange juice to to submit an orange so they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate frosting always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI like an Italian ... arrests whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty and the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them in the mix her for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so\nIt's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the boiled trusting which is sort of similar involve the egg white print out what just sugar water egg whites ... but the thing about the Italian so you add the sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites in America to about one sixty\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build up my confidence and start working with something a little bit more advanced", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Carrollton", "day": "14"}
