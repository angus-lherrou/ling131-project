Florida huh your father grew up in the south your mother was from Guam well tell us about on time for it or what what was the community like well\nI guess it was an interesting place I I Would say it was lower class living it was not the best living situation but I feel like it gave me a lot of contrast to ask for a lot of great things\nWell you you're right that there was Jamaican Cuban Haitian food and culture so the food must have been really great\nYeah definitely it was a lot a lot of wonderful I mean like Jamaican beef patties you know cabbage and and peace and rice\nAnd then on my father's side you know like things that my grandmother made just really really hearty um delicious southern food you know a Mac and cheese and she made this delicious spaghetti that\nHad the I think he put ketchup and which sounds strange now but it gave it a nice sweet ass and so it's definitely a a wide range of a phrase it that I grew up\nIn you and you also write to you when you were fourteen you are overweight and uh and you became a beacon a as a result you so you really changed your entire dog yeah when you were a\nTeen him right I did um I think a lot of it with me trying to find myself a lot of it with me trying to find my identity within all of that\nSo by becoming vegans that set you apart from your family your brothers and sisters who were so leading the traditional diet\nFor me it was it was a stark contrast you know like I didn't\nSuch you apart from your family your brothers and sisters who are so leading the traditional die\nRight it was it was a stark contrast you know like our dinner or very meat centered and you know starch heavy because a lot of it too you know we're trying to feed a large family on a on a small budget so\nThe whole concept of cooking from scratch was born because I had to be creative I had to think of a new way to create this food that I loved and I want it to taste but that fit buy diet\nDeal like the texture or do you find it more tender or kiss and fully\nMore tender I tend to like meet that is not as ... you know I'd rather have flavorful than a hundred and my wife tends to like meet that is more tender I think also since its grilled\nYou notice the difference in texture you know of the slate trying on the outside it cetera if the inside is more under I\nWould guess that it may be the age of the animal\nBecause if it's a younger animal it's probably going to be more tender and if it's an older animal shelter that is not going to work does need to cook that low and slow I can do [laughter]\nSo you need the equivalent of allowing ... very expensive I mean we have to be a ... for a quick cooking ... you can't use lake and you can you shoulder right okay well you get just would be chillier can be chewing ...\nWhich is what I've been doing just because it's an easier cut to find and less expensive on this I have another side which is salt ah yeah I mean I've always put some salt but right before you cook yeah I'm just before I cook a\nClient you try to get ahead of time tossing it with all those other things that are you know padded try or just ... ...\nRally it gets a nice here I bet you the salt would make a difference\nOkay well I I Would ask them just ask them about ... ... what kind of isn't the way they get their land with him\nIn the search for this I did buy like a leg\nUh hello butcher sawed off lamb for me but ah that that didn't really help a and that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um [noise] you know hard to wear\nFor me but uh but that doesn't really help a that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um [noise] you know hard to work around the leg getting off of it yeah\nLike strictly the salty for two hours on Iraq is a good idea\nYeah yeah crank shot packet thanks janitor by them\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you want to know what to do with shrimp heads or tails please give us a ring anytime have five

this isn't it terrible Hi Nick how can we help you well\nI've spent years failing to recreate the dishes but I Do India you know like you to lack of the continued gradients\nGlee I'm having issues with the Asian and sit around here are smaller slightly sweeter and cause anger that North American the ins but they don't just color like right on the ends do after long cooking\nAnd there are less sweet than the daily as a ... so we're on your for ... like a do or even something that's in the background like butter chicken\nYou end up with that great career you if you attempt to lead or accordingly me curry if you go with one of the law or something like that or just something that's true sure every usually there's just too many onions standard larger American yellow on\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet [noise] do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked\nA ... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different and fall in love onions solid\nI Know it's there is going to say so\nHe knows what I'm saying well how about challenge\nBecause you know they are sweeter than a yellow on yeah but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is a very different\nI mean if you're a big complaint is volume I Would think just a yellow onion and just useless is the simplest\nThing I was getting the spices right and using whole spices and posting them and doing all the things you should do\nOne you're going to see useless is the simplest\nThing I Would think getting the spices right and using host by some testing them and doing all the things you should do will make much difference in weather using yellow where the bank and ride I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that and you know the sort of side bars here is also the total lack of a veil ability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced to many of those careers we eat at color and everyone tries to Fox later a kind of the athletes are black that's what you\nKnow yeah I just don't make sense you know one serious Koch I Want to come to your house how\nWe do our own cereal smoking we do our own fermenting a lie on building a salami Kate actually out of\nA surprise that scare I visited salami cage I've never met someone who built their own that's pretty cool how\nI Am super press yeah now we're not and we've not helped you at all but yeah thank you so my mom always said it was less yellow onion yeah ours are really in addition to hell and airy dilemma\nWell you know what I
