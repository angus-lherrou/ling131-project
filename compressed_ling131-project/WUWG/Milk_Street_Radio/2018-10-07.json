McCarron talks about her article in the midst of authenticity is killing time Mary\nKaren argues the Tex Mex is an authentic was not a cheap rip off of Mexican cooking\nBarbecue joints are forcing into many high prices mom and pop Tex Mex eateries are closing down in our you know\nA good uh let's start with if possible a loose definition of when you say Tex Mex food but what what are you actually talking about\nA loose definition of Tex Mex is it's cooking\nDeveloped in Texas um originally as often our ranch food in Texas back when Texas was not very urban\nBy people often of Mexican descent um or who are town knows you know who've been in Texas in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the U.S [noise]\nUm that using the local ingredients and more kind of Mexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that is Mexican but it's also tax and and it's really fundamentally our regional cuisine of Texas\nSo there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those radios\nInterestingly one of those ingredients as human in San Antonio there's actually\nA small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore I started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex cooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of the Canary Islands\nThe chili picking which is a native to lead to Texas is also very important ah beef a flour tortillas and you know Margaret\nChili picking which is a native Chile to Texas is also very important ah beef\nA flour tortillas and you know more recently yellow cheese and like sometimes even Velveeta you know you want to make a great case do at home like\nGet

super high cast iron skillet to add one comment with caramel and they go on in the morning with butter\nYeah I think it's very much like an upside down cake because you cook in a cast iron skillet\nMan there yeah ... but you can also do put like peaches are ... are you in the bud and bud or in sugar and fruit and you cook that down you add the batter to it but this is just a basic skill a cake where you melt the butter\nAdded to the batter put it back in I think still a parks her new book Braveheart has a ... a piece for these she's the Baker for Syria seats dot com yes and you can

New York times\nAnd went on to reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal they also employing a smart literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist of the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full podcast meow Rio\nI'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone does but uh in December Seventy five you became the food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that\nSo and not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in training\nAnd just and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire a name was Charlotte Curtis the woman who did harm may was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper a Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter] well fortunately for all of us you became a critic uh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody orders to food you get to taste [noise] you can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously is critic\nIs that something you eventually get used to in and get to like or is it always a a burden but as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a ship experience [laughter]\nYeah well that sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go with crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people an expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of ... about dressing up in disguises but you know I think the first one to really do that I I Love this quote a as you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more embarrassing to show up in a way glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I Would say so\nYou don't know what to do should I flipped off though no should I you know play its author and I had glasses\nAnd wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nLet's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera you're you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices\nOne of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera you you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers\nSilly like Yelp and so on so right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right [noise]\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI haven't gotten them in the past not for a long time just as on a mailing list or example many years ago\nThe questionnaires from the gas ... asking me to be a responder with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even ask Tim's the gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local critic just to have a voice in there so I don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean the social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over the hill is supposed to talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place\nYou walk into a restaurant in the first Fifteen or thirty seconds what are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad [noise]\nI might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and I'm moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek diner in Chicago known as Lou Mitchell's and it's right near the American to exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just\nStock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life\nAt the breakfast and I want one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants around eight thirty and I had to stand on line a little and does he does the owner or his managing gives out little boxes of um a\nCandy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me\nAnd said where is your place and I said what place than he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nAnd I really didn't for [laughter] like Campbell or in a good see you know like you look around\nThe milk that is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipe Tuscan beef and that person to\nClean area and ... you know the recipe it's a Tuscan beef and peppers to its beef lots of beef obviously pepper ground pepper and why county whatever just throwing the pot cooking slow come back a few hours later it's done\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is oddly flavor Willis\nAnd the wind isn't rich and ... it's kind of just acidic can kind of nasty actually [laughter]\nSo I don't know how they used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nHim critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we can all the liquid out of the equation and so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch\nSo Chris we really took the wind out of the equation and in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of beef really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the\nOnly liquid that we're going to use to break this late comes from the meat itself there's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice and\nYou're not supposed to be before you put it in ... you could be a little bit then put the meat in but you're not doing anything else would lead before because there\nWere not we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of thought chained to me without actually having to do the work which we don't we live around here\nSo instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning on the meat there that you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the ones who are the ones not in\nThe ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce economy the meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strained ... chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nFor us to be the tough going to be from peppers to almost no prep work\nA little use tomato paste the meat in three hours of the up and take it out reduced to monitor that any are done\nIt's a matter of fact and it tastes great taste so good when thank you You're welcome\nThis recipe for ... and ... do have

versatile useful spice blend in the world outside Saturn recedes and for Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a Barry used to be used almost employees civil lemon it's our but it's also lend money to create on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\nCoriander seed not ground coriander is something most people do have around I think is also really useful I'm going to put in a bid

[noise] and you can buy one of those ... and you can keep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices the spice sponsor for example\nAt breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some ... some pepper or something on it and you can dress up as you can dress up in effect\nNext is pantry items that I think teeny is literally a must yeah and me sell\nAny by the way goes gray with chocolate hurry so yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example\nOr a sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white me so for chicken or ed and I so I have the fish when you're ...\nAnd then my last generation would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can ... over meet after it's cooked\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... because they provide a smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy a whole human seed if you get a pepper Grider putting coarse salt and then putting humans seat\nSo instead of salt and pepper your rights seller in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking he really can't beat that and then the last thing is that really big crystal like sea salt or ... or ... and salt just to finish food over that crunch\nYou get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay it is a great start one less thing if you want to be a little exotic by her foot pepper you are FA you have to bite on line is so soft damp\nPepper in sort of flakes and its chocolate ... and rich is not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes and it's just a few little tricks like that can\nMake your cooking so much better so anyway that's our list\nOkay finally done what I was looking at them and\nTake care of it is mostly radio I'm Christopher\nOkay I really don't know what I was looking for me to take care of it\nHas to radio on Christopher Kimball if you have a cooking question are we just want us to help you resolve a colon airy argument please give us a call at eight\nFive five four to six Ninety four three the number once again is eight five five four to six Ninety four three or email us questions I'd ... radio dot com\nWalk in the middle street who's gone Hi my name is Chris and taking my call today pleasure act we help you\nGet range recently right now in nature thing I got it bad for how much it would cost threaten a gas giant kitchen which can be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars [noise]\nSo I'd like to know your hand I never cooked on a gas strange but I Know it generally referred by professional but knowing that extra cost I Would encourage had this luxury if it were\nWell when we built out the milk street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use induction for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we do to install induction it turns out induction works very well if he'd so fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas\nBut once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job also safer because you're not going to bring yourself so I wouldn't ...
