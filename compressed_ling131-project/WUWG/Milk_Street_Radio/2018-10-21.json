known for his book such as God in\nHis latest book for land he tells a story of no\nMark how are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod was my first ... book a long time ago and your latest book milk I also found to be at least as interesting as God\nSo let's start at the beginning I guess the philosophy people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk\n[noise] yeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation myth that involve mill and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with child birth so it's the beginning of lights\nWell but but some of the examples we're a great deal that the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost this new turned to see of milk to create the universe it it was more of them don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can turn a glass of milk I guess it's going to make sure that the thing you say is interesting is that for forty percent of Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually it's a world average about forty percent of people in the world trade milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain that you need lactase to digest lactose in milk and the theory was Europeans do not have the gene the cuts off the production of lactase when you get older\nWhat everybody is supposed to everybody when they get to about two years old this enzyme lactase is supposed to\nStop working and then lactose become sins adjustable [laughter] some people and that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk\nAnd it tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk [noise]\nIt's interesting that this mutation that we have is presented as normal and the normal people are presented as having an illness was true actually lactose intolerance is what's supposed to be friends\nOkay secondly I don't personally worry about raw eggs but if you're your own chickens if you clean the well I Would think you are okay but it is a risk pasteurized okay I have to get them up to that temperature one sixty but\nOkay I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't either a supermarket eggs are very well clean there's a\nFilm on the outside of an egg when you harvest it definitely feels different right and it protects the eggs from air getting in to the egg but the supermarket eggs are that's rinsed off and then they re oh oiled them or they put something on the outside to protect the egg but they're very very well clean\nChristmas right is the outside of the that really you need to make sure gets cleaned you know it's one of those things you know you want to say the over eighty the under five and the immune impaired perhaps should not have these eggs are taken to at least one sixty but I think other than that\nYou know you're fine you know just don't leave them out forever and the good thing about your bags if they're really fresh which means do beat up beautifully because they are so fresh\nI think he's still not sure if they don't take care thank you Beatrice say\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a comment or question please give us a call at eight

Kentucky in Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina and if I left anybody out\nIt was a north Georgia and an Alabama and of course ... Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina and if I left anybody out please don't hurt me it was um and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nWhat do you you drove ... regular right when you're driving I have a van it's a Chevy astro or how many miles how long you set out to do this trip this the pilgrimage what were you looking for and how long were you doing [noise]\nHonestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles\nAnd then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally a journey into the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot of what is written and has been written about 'em to people and the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nA lot of it comes from one person's perspective and their family but there are other experiences in Appalachian I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're at this model culture\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated\nAnd we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks rough scotch Irish I'm so they're they're actually the last census there are more people in southern Appalachia who identify\nAs Latino are African Americans are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point I Am my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you uh you say chili bond carried out from the Dixie ... red Greece flick wax paper where my favorite [laughter] okay so now I now know defend that so so these were really good and for what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain a chili plan is not a chili dog and\nIt was really good ... or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili plant is not a chili dog\nThat's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy chili mixture hamburger ... that it was packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard\nAnd the texture is extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's not kind of floating around in there it's in there or being I'm\nFine and the best way to think about this is this is this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat [laughter]\nYou don't want something your chili on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that\nBut a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food that was this really through\nThe ... sweet and savory banana pudding it had powder jolt of the custard okay I could forgive you that when I was reading the red ... no no wait a minute now that's that's a that's a ... that you're from red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\n... thank you so much a fascinating book and uh it's just like when someone takes the time of the year or so the hours to really\nTo really do the research and find out what's actually going on ... thank you so much thank you crafts\n\nThat was ... her book is gold medals and watching the news was\nGrowing up and blah blah locals hadn't seen as one family name their street tutor road and the next week ... across the way to put up a sign did more for\nThe Rio Grande valley was a breeze and minister hills wearing hills selfies quarters road and bear mountain\nUp a lot to take seriously to\nLogan giant greasy cuts shorter legs of watching being\nToday things are named by marketing directors watcher named so real stories are real people that are willing\nToday things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia named tell real stories about real people in\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen ... street to chat with editorial director jam Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto generally as\nMaria I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is I and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well ... was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise]\nFirst of all our ratios of ingredients are way off in general are garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other players we don't use nearly enough days old they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that and\nWe use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they in their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course British stickers were luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work [laughter] I also learned that we get the order wrong\nThe order in which you add ingredients to either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the base for example into soon you're going to over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong fish\nConsistent so your goal here is to get shape pesto that's pretty try is on a green sauce right to strike\nIt's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it ever touches the pasta but it really if it's that loose then you've added to my olive oil and in general pessimism custard John I feel it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered pets or not it's considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil we think supposed to be fair and earlier state\nSo what's the order of the ingredients all get the orders very important again 'cause you don't want to order process the ingredients you start out with the garlic signed up for the salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find that it's usually distributed through the stuff\nWe had our she's she wants to find the ground add those ... and again you add those to the pilots and the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheap\nNow the ... the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumb\nYou add those to the pilots and the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheats\nNow the baseball goes it but one of the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they do in the\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just posted a few times and it's done arcades most of the day is what we find the ... tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right to system the without over process and turning it into a watery puree\nDisillusioned after was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of passes and we're down I Would assume anyone in general I\nUse a food processor did like this has probably persona non grata\nSo is this is good as what you had in general\nWell it lacks the romance of bashing it with a mortar and passed all but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the board that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious\nSo Jim pass to ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker\nYou can get this recipe for pesto other generation when seven seven milk street\nI'm
