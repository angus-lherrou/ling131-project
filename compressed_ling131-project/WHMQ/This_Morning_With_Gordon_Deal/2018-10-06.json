you [laughter] so I just thought you know this is an African unity to really dig into what is a research showing what experts\nAbout um spotting fake reviews for the first one which I Am not ... but I'm examined the timing of reviews if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that if those are fake refuse [laughter]\nUm that's because there's a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nOr how about the um the accusation or the investigation and Amazon doing that ah there were payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were on that some of its employees mostly in China um we're taking bribes\nTo delete negative
