tight\nAnd so as a result uh ... you know warehouse operators that had maybe been kind of\nYou know maybe testing out automation here and there are kind of piling deeper into the earth and and and looking for more tools including robots that can help in increased productivity ah you know without having to add as many workers as they might normally do because the labor market is so tight\nYeah explain ... house some companies are deploying this robot technology\nWelter there's there there's a range of way that it's being done on you know on on the warehouse side there's a a type of robot called a collaborative little bought a which some people call ... and these are sort of smaller robot that can kind of share space\nWith with workers or maybe at the mobile robot that it's kind of ...

orders um put them in ... so folks can take them away impact until there's a number of different ways that robotics are being used\nThe um news is somewhat good for the worker I guess who is still used to pack these boxes feel like a lot worse than ships have been replaced\nWell so this what employers are saying is that look we're not replacing a worker with robots what we're doing is it helping him ... because a particularly with e commerce the growth is just continuing they see this demand going up and not so they're able to get orders out more quickly\nUm you know by by using a
