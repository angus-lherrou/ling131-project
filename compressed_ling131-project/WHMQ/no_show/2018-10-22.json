today I'm Glad to have\nA Brenda and Gwen or suck\nI knew Brenda because one of the partners of the family business center is modest brothers clicker\nWhere she is the head of operations in development so nice to have you here thank you thank you very much and then you are in also in business with your husband Glen reviewing when good morning and thank you for the invitation and the and the businesses graduate pest solutions correct\nSo this was a the pests have graduated from work to work\n[laughter] alive or dead you know you got to be because they just always\nBeen here and there always will be recorded for caterpillar probably I Would never have a butterfly around\n[laughter] you know now that I\nYou know I haven't had one of those so let's just go back to the root and how did you become this I I had mentioned to you that I've given talks a couple of times to the pest control technology conference and it is a certain kind of person who decides to become an entomologist yeah\nAbsolutely and I actually came in kind of through the fault I'm Brennan I have known each other since high school friends who are Fifteen\nAnd her father needed some slave labor for Ross country trip because he was a schoolteacher uh-huh\nI got into this because I volunteer to be a driver for him and we went to a bunch of national parks out west and with a lot of camping so without going into a lot of detail I at that point decided I wanted to go into forestry uh-huh\nDuring the course of my education I had as we all usually do have some mentors someone within the\nEducational framework that will give you some sage advice right and I had a professor who didn't want to squash my forestry dream and if you study bugs in rodents you'll always be employed [laughter] so it it at that point when I graduated look at her job Brennan I decided to get married\nUm and I realized that if I Want to be gainfully employed to go into the pest control industry and just kind of fell into it so that's the precipitous rise of this and then going through the careers us raising our children at a certain point we said\nThat's control industry and yet it was kind of fell into it so that's the precipitous rise of this and then going through the careers us raising our children at a certain point we said you know what we could do this I don't know in in ten years ago\nWe were you were that worked for a larger company before you many started your own yes\nUh-huh exactly and actually in Chicago 'cause it's a time when I graduated from Syracuse um she was living and had a career in Chicago so I wound up moving out there we got married and I took a job out there and I learned from a very good company\nWhat commercial pest control was like uh-huh I also learned that classroom training about bugs in rodents is not necessarily a move well into the business environment technical knowledge is one part of your people skills is a much bigger\nPart of of being in the ... so we don't know each other well but uh the thing that surprised me and doing a couple of these conferences in is how much people in the pest control business love path [laughter] uh well yeah usually have the extra\nInitial love my mom used to I don't know why but I I've always loved the outdoors and\nMy mom would get upset with me when I have frozen grasshoppers and had a magnifying glass and was and I don't know I was I had a fascination with bugs and uh and just being in the outdoors so\nWe we just get into that and you have a lot of people in our industry that a lot of technical knowledge of the ones that really grow into the bigger companies are the ones that reach as I'm saying beyond the technical stuff but when we get together we can to\nFall for that uh-huh started beating up on each other or you know it and and have conversations about\nWhat's working for you to take care of bedbugs will continue to get rid of the answers this working in because you go is is you know what to trade show ya\nYou got the exhibit hall and they everybody's got the next best thing that really just wipe them out\nFor you right in and you're not a lot of money to kill the past but you need to be careful of what you're doing to the people I correct yeah oh yeah\n... that I just follow up on your comment\nBecause you're a hundred percent right the thing that I have always been impressed with and love England it's his passion his passion for the work that he does and you wouldn't necessarily think of that\nFor pest control and yet he he he loves the bonds he left the service\nAnd he just brings that ... than I Am attracted right\nYeah you know our our our industry just to give the big picture since you've spoken to a lot of people a lotta a lotta people look at us as an individual as a year and exterminator here you know you're kinda on this\nThere's something to it because it's been passed down for ... you know many years I haven't seen any home remedies myself there were an absolute horror on a lotta times that you catch it early\nAnd you can solve problems um sometimes it coincides with maybe something else that's going on you know the pro whatever the bug came in on right got taken out and\nSo you know sometimes like ... actually I just you just have a heart traps and the killer traps and I I like the killer traps better because if I don't catch the have a hard it's been starving in there and ... I think my\nFavorite fits less cruel yeah if you will simply be quick yeah yeah\nSo I'm I'm just wondering how many mice are in my house there were three of their hundreds\nUm it it's it's hard to tell\nBecause it because as you look around and we all know the little yeah things they leave a around right I mean they leave those things stick around for a long time so you may be looking around I'll go in and do an inspection for somebody and see a lotta droppings but when I actually set traps and put poisons out\nA catch one or two in the problems over because they've just been sitting there for so this is the only way to tell us to to run some traps and ... and and see what results you get yeah and and then I go from there so\nDo you normally get cold and after I Would imagine house in business you do both correct so so business probably has more diligent because there's just you don't want my running around your restaurant correct but but you get called into a house more often if somebody's niche ride it or are you the\nYou know there there are folks that hire us for seasonal agreement and come in we call it I grabbed care agreement and we come to the home three times during the course of the ... and his or her lax\nHire us for seasonal agreement and I'm going to come in we call it a grad care agreement and we come to the home three times during the course of the ... and it's a proactive yeah you know and but that's usually the person who's tired of dealing with it right who lives in the woods a wooded area or\nAn area that just as prone to a lot of wrote an activity and or aunt activity you know if if if we come to your home and get an Saturday or all those folks usually have us do preventative service for\nThe following years obviously on hold for a long period of time so I'm home alone as many homeowners are pretty proactive with is because they've seen the damage that the ants do other termites to do or that the mice I mean you have fires from from mice chewing on wires yeah things like that\nOr I had that once we we are ... broken when he took\nThe sport you know I have a massive looked like it was cartoon yeah fitness wired and it was like Australia [laughter] discuss [laughter] funny\nSome of the funniest experiences I've had or with with the the\nThe wife if you will yeah it's a it's more for the husband to do something about my son is on with the and then so when I show up I'm usually dealing with the husband who are there and tiny doesn't really want to hire a C I can handle the secondhand on us\nBut the biggest believers I have in having an ongoing service or the husbands who had the mice chew on their\nToys motorcycle and arrive or their car and the ... damage to that at that point I just want to make it All right how large of pets do you get into a well this is one of the one of the things I\nHis public service announcement here a lot of people think if you're\nEver exterminator license on unquote you also do raccoons squirrels and it's actually two different departments in Massachusetts uh-huh my license comes from the department of agriculture nuisance wildlife comes from the department of wildlife uh-huh\nSo you've got two different licenses right most past you know where you're ends right yeah I can do mice I can do rats when you get to the bigger furry creatures you have to have a different life not for that and and we just we usually refer that out to someone who has that it'll probably for the company not through its own agency or not right you know this town agencies won't handle\nRight most of the you know federal ... largest skunk on\nMy front porch you haven't actually what I had was a very secure bird feed but yeah\nAnd luckily I had a little vial of Fox urine don't ask me why Iran\nAccents yeah there have I have I perfectly aimed at and I threw the vile so that was a little puddle of Fox urine writer and those of the sky just looked at me through the window and like what the hell are you [laughter]\nYou are in the ... yeah I'm On the street but it's in a few what did he respond appropriately in the last friday okay yeah yeah yeah so anyway I mean\nI'm sure I was going to have a skunk smell minute so how does your business compete in this area it is different question than before you have other small agencies you have other large national companies\nUm how do you just keep a toehold in the in the business and\nCetera well actually this you might speak to 'em Glenn has a background in commercial a contract work at a very very strong deep\nUm background in that so one of the things that we did do or do you want an ongoing basis\nAt least on to commercial bed ... and going back a number of years ago a state of Connecticut had um you know their pesticide bed came up Glenn knows how to process those beds and find them and we are actually\nThe one vendor for the state of Connecticut in Hartford county you know everything from the governor's mansion to the presidents and everything in between that we do mhm so you know that certainly is a good way right guard in yeah\nBidding is a odd because we are small and lean we compete on an hourly\nRate that are on during those rights regular emergency or we can all of those employees are potential customers get calls from them dry food service work and how do you offer discounts to employees the stain or a or a location\nAnd you have a a team of any size of people might go out and spray or you were actually on the ground doing it [noise]\nI well I'm I'm an owner operator I mainly focus on the sales in the biz fourth and during the busy season all hands on deck for them and we have accrued three\nSo violent guys they're just constantly are doing that and then right and we do a lot of spring during the season it's a lot of the IBM work that we do where we're not it's not all chemicals they integrated polite Senegal resigned as a manager yeah\nYeah so what what are the qualities of a good uh employee that they're going to\nUm good people skills uh-huh number one eagerness to learn um you're going to be coached yeah you got to have a bit of this hunter\nEasier now to conduct a herd of if you're in yeah\nI mean you have to think about where they living where if I'm any on where am I in this house if I'm a mouse where am I live and then there's it's it's just a different mindset that we coached the guys on yeah and uh and then being able to deal with the customers in terms of their fears on their ... their customers especially people have bed bugs or you've got all\nKind of walk them off the ledge yes because this is just another aspect of my industry where like every industry you know if you've got a problem and you go on the Internet and research it obviously are horror stories\nRight and I am I we we don't have bed bugs in our house but a friend was sure that we did but he was wrong right um but when we research that's like yeah thousands of dollars for a train beagles I can smell them or I hate the room up to a hundred and forty degrees of these worth thousands of dollars into\nA lot of tactics Glen is really developed an approach which really includes resident education uh and it's been actually very cost effective and and our customers are very satisfied\nAnd and so we do it can be effective ... and I think that Clinton approach with you know most of my education and correct you hear of materials or is it good\nWell that's an interesting aspect of the dogs because everybody loves the dog is um they have a niche in our industry ... in the niches bedbugs hitchhikers uh-huh if you own a motel hotel or one of the big um hospitality industry\nPeople coming and going there and if these things are hitchhiking your that ruined can be fined today and tomorrow somebody left the bug right if you get a dog they're all run through twenty rooms at a time thirty rooms at a time and say there's no bugging their uh-huh if you're the owner of that hotel restaurant you go that's a good value I at this way I catch it early and when you catch it early\nIt's much easier fix than when you get out of control and the extremes that you see on the Internet\nThe heat is another one if you think about it he is um [noise]\nUh [noise] excuse me heat heat is a situation where\nThe Internet the heat is another one if you think about it he is um [noise]\nUh [noise] excuse me heat heat is a situation where we found that apply heat when I leave and I'm done with that John there's nothing left to kill the bugs even if they're reintroduce mhm and so I rely mostly on pesticide applications and then that leaves a residual for you but\nThe heat was sold our industry as kind of um you know the order situation there's a lot of stuff and you can't get people to move was though it gives you an opportunity we can just kill and it just it doesn't work\nYour hand if he were fifty one of the person that words newspapers\nAnd the bugs all go hide under all all the blanket slows and write him back out when the heat came\nIn the first place could come again and then rather than solve it\nRises saw the right always heard when you're in a hotel to just pull back especially they have the poster had were pull it back right if his blood in the paper and\nYou know I'm engaged in this issue you know one of the things that I've learned over the years is that a lot of medical students get very little um a course work on nutrition um I mean it it said in some cases it's only a matter of a few hours over a four year\nUh education and then when you had in that you know the internships and the residency there's also you know no focus on nutrition\nYet most of the diseases that illnesses that\nAre doctors have to treat are directly related to nutrition or lack there of so doesn't that make sense for us to have a greater focused on nutrition and I met with some of the top you know uh you know a medical school a doctor is a ... you know in Boston the other day talking about how we can\nKind of force our medical schools in the medical institutions to embrace this issue of nutrition ... more forcefully and more directly and so we're trying to figure out ways that weekend\nAnd set of eyes medical schools to you know focus more on nutrition and where ... is an ongoing discussion but you know what they're saying to me is um obesity is on the rise in this country and our license expectancy in the United states has gone down\n... was going up for years for decades and decades decades we're now going in the wrong direction and they believe it's all related to a what we eat and the lack of nutrition that we get\nWell that's why it's important that the work that you're doing on the hill is happening weekend and week out your end hunger now hashtags and constantly trying to remind the other side of the aisle why this is important while you're on the farm bill conference committee in advocating for these issues and why doing things like the march for the food bank I can be a way to participate in that over thirty\nPeople or groups are now to join us different groups of because they know what they're getting into\nIt I don't think so you know I had a couple of conversations with folks even yesterday they were like and I did it once before and I don't know if I can do I like don't you don't have the noodles thing only I had the whole thing you know you don't have to do the whole thing Congress limit I'm Glad you\nYeah well the deal is is that uh you know everybody who even participate in the middle east for an hour or a few miles you know every dollar that's raised a you know goes to in a foreign cars yeah\nIt is it a show for it so I I I'm really inspired by the fact that thirty people already yeah have or how many how many much last\nYear I have no idea you know I don't I Try to I just like leave I ... I think we're I think we're breaking records here I Know that just it'll be a parade in Wyoming our tribute\nAnd ah I'm dressing like a pirate on the first day and I'm currently growing an authentic beer and we'll see you later this afternoon after I Do my weekly wine tasting so I'll be a\nParticularly happy to meet with you um see how my beard is going to I'm putting my beard up for auction and for the food bank to people can shave me between day one in\nThe march and all that money raised in the shaving we'll go to the food bank of western mass or do you want to go out and participate [noise] yeah I'm going to ...

selling author and he has a new book the game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight he'll be at the broad side for a book reading signing Q and a discussion tomorrow evening Wednesday at seven o'clock\nThe game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight the game the game means the Harvard Yale game\n... as a conceit for a book and American Nineteen sixty eight it strikes me that\nThis is an oxymoron in some ways it's a football game between two Ivy League schools not exactly football powerhouses and the time of tumult in America that was I think on President except maybe for the civil war\nAnd yet you managed to put these two very different pieces of the world together a football game between Ivy League schools\nIn America in crisis it works tell us why it works\nOr if I knew that um I'd be a rich man today because I could bottle that formula and sell it I you know when you describe it that way it's absolutely true midway through the writing of the book I thought what am I doing how am I hearing\nThis a game and that tumultuous time but I think I I came to feel that that game was\nUh like some kind of a miracle that took like like a flower blooming in a city sidewalk\nOr and so I wanted to contrast these sort of miraculous nature of that game which took place in a time of such division or you know a black versus white men verses women are hard has for ... and so forth that the game itself seemed to just be something\nOf a miracle to me um and I wanted to find out who the players were that played in it and of course they were deeply involved in the events of Nineteen sixty eight\nTwo of the people who drive this story are packed Conway yes and Calvin Hill yes and those are names that some people will recognize particularly football fans will recognize Calvin Hill\nLet's start with Calvin Hill because his story is fascinating and\nBy the way when I was in the eighth grade and the Riverdale country school out in the hell\nWas the superstar athlete on the football team he was the football team you know I I didn't really know me was a senior\nBut he was a star there and then he's was it was announced he was going to go to Yale which seems someone like him because he could go to any football powerhouse school that he wanted but he went to Yale toasted about Calvin Hill because his story is indeed fascinated\nWith Calvin Hill or a grew up in Baltimore his father had been a share cropper on a farm in I Believe South Carolina\nAnd had a fled after fighting after getting into a fight with the boss a and a fled to Baltimore where he'd be where he worked in construction\nAnd uh Kelvin his father couldn't read or write until his wife taught him uh and uh but he decided that for his son his only child education was everything\nAnd he bought 'em an encyclopedia when Kelvin was only four or five\nAnd said son someday everything you want to know will be in these books when you learn to read anyway\nCalvin won a scholarship to the Riverdale school which was a um uh in in ...\nNo we'll be in these books when you learn to read anyway\nCalvin won a scholarship to the Riverdale school which was a a um uh in in the river and the Riverdale section and the reason he ended up at Yale as you say he could have gone to any college in the country he was recruited by over eighty schools including some of the biggest football colleges in the country\nAnd he wanted it one day a he played a cookie on a day when he was supposed to go visiting schools\nUm and when he came back ah after having played hooky in in going out in New York is is coach said it you know you should look at Yale or his coach ... I'm Sorry not as coaches assistant coach said you should look at yeah\nUm and so ah he did and she wound up I'm watching the ... game in the ... Boulder we're sixty thousand fans\nAnd Calvin thought I've always wanted to play at a school with the big uh a stadium but more importantly Yale had never had a black quarterback or very few teams in the country had ever had a black quarterback the first starting quarterback in the NFL who was African American\nOr would be in the fall of Nineteen sixty eight or and so\nCalvin Hill but I Want to be the first at Yale he'd been a quarterback at Riverdale one of the best quarterback in the country\nUm so he considered going to Harvard but Harvard had been the first Ivy League school to have a African American quarterback Johnny McCluskey and sixty five ah in in the sixty for instance you five so Galileo said I'm going to go to Yale and be the first African American quarterback he was moved to fall back two days and\nAnd never got to play quarterback never got yeah football I mean a quarterback it you know we are speaking with George how cold he is with lead based author his previous National Book award finalist book was the big house his new book is the game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he will be at the broadside tomorrow evening once said seven o'clock for book reading signing Q and a\nAnd discussion the another person another character plays a big part in this book is ad Conway and pet Conway is a fascinating story and I'm Wondering if you might read a piece of it which I have more starting\nA at the age where the marker is about past Conway who well you can tell a story but I think this paragraph tells\nWhen Conway left Harvard in January of Nineteen sixty six almost as many students supported the war as opposed it you'd returned to a campus where the vast majority of students were passionately against it every bulletin board he passed was covered with anti war literature\nYou could hardly walk through the square without being offered an anti ROTC manifesto\nWhen Conway cross the yard on his way to class you occasionally hurts students standing on the steps of widened her library railing against the war through bullhorn it angered him to hear them chanting ho ho Ho Chi Minh and they'll laugh is gonna win\nHe says bright yellow local hero label whenever you see it you know you're eating food from the land where you live [noise] [noise]\nSo anyway the morning with Bob learning and Denise was the only live\nIn the\nFinal round [laughter] from second one on one by one major [laughter]\nThis is the best of bill Newman [noise]\nWHM Pete news in New York\n[noise] this is bill Newman WHM [noise]\nWelcome to our monthly comedy quiz let me turn the microphones over to our comedians are standup people take it away please thank you and people get confused army stand up people\nYet they end up you know you may center buildings or do ... we are currently sitting improvise or were had it all you hear [laughter] thanks money thanks for Asia you're ready to start\nLow everybody I'm Laura Patrick of the ... group and I'm excited to be hosting this month comedy quiz show in the comedy quiz a couple of comedians and wasn't smart person will attempt to answer questions from our quiz master testing them on their knowledge of the world you can imagine how that will go\nAre funny people today are me Laura Patrick and Pam Victor in our smart person is WHM peas montebello Monti thanks for joining us I sort of thing\nLaura Patrick and Pam Victor and are smart person is WHM peas montebello Monti thanks for joining us I\nThink of myself as funny rather than smart button OK well we all had a dream resident company excluded I mean if you are you are Pam Victor is\nPresident and founder of happier valley comedy which recently opened a brand new comedy theater on route nine in Hadley\nHappier valley comedy offers regular comedy shows a comedy school and the through laughter professional development program which uses improv to improve communication and collaboration and creativity in the workplace more about happier valley comedy at W.

A. O. recounts that say if the postal service doesn't pay for pensions American taxpayers will\nAll their pension payments and I've read the G. A. O. recounts that say if the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose while they're under charging a customer\nIs a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay is there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\nUm\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the pulse\nDoes nothing there's nothing to prevent the postal service for simply or the ... I'm In charge and trying to a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this side on this ... single the scent of wanting to China or\nThat that that it may do that and that's basically what they're ... to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming into the U.S postal service that's actually a viable question and something that may actually be looking to do later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for\nWell I I guess for the way that trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it the UP you this is this the United nations agency a says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buys something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China you have the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos or less uh then they get charged a flat rate\nAnd that that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market right well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate\nUm shouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden that you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China\nThat might actually make American goods are good from other places competitive where they're not today and the only difference could be the shipping cause right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of vehicles the administration is looking at him and a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making you know precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently and a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the ah the\nThomas a for like ...\nI guess I'm interested to and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages are coming from China but given the volume that Amazon is selling I've a feeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them cause another dollar dollar and a half to ship\nA that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to have all of a sudden the rates went up to something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages that could make a big difference\nNow is that no you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are basically start turning over all these rocks hum of issues that people\nHaven't looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to uh to to deal with them and says is again it's another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that with air force thing because this has been something that's been going on in the sort of process for decades in the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the restoration\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that the is that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been a justice for inflation or not I mean there's a ... I Believe that rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know works I don't actually know the exact mechanism whether it works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a ... percentage of\nSean you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying a for gasoline let's say what you were paying in Nineteen sixty nine if you were buying gasoline and I I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what it costs now\nI'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent I remember my parents used to be a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house for rent\nAnd and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would do\nWhy is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump nobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else has said hey maybe we should bring that raid forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's I mean it it's and that's a good question and the answers that as with so many things it's just so much easier to say ah find whatever let's\nLet's just let it let it be and move on to something else if someone more pressing um and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just having been looked at her address talked about it a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up in when they were talking about it you know the trade you know the NAFTA\nDeal and other things that people haven't talked about are addressed in a while and\nThis is in yeah I mean it's the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mindset of a standard sort of Washington that never really probably to do it and what things about Trump is that he\nDoesn't subscribe to that mindset of many and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge and on some areas but other times you know it takes somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say you know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know that\nYou know the NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean for a long time people there were only saying what is going is working fine we don't need to address this really to rock the boat and Trump said no I Wanna rock the boat and see what happens yeah that's exactly what he's doing that again with the decision\nWell it just kind of stunned me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what are we charging for this is that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine\nI don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China I mean before uh before next and even sort of opened opened us up an open China up so we had better relations with them\nI'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but\n[noise] yeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know those are as you mentioned the lodges that cabins\nThe places that we use and the memories that we have these parks um culture landscapes the battlefield to cemeteries all of that I'm I'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog\nNow let me ask you this because I'm always want to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual parents wherever you are and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and there's a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the parched one time on one day every year\nI think you pay thirty bucks but if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar proud and maybe a little bit more now ... million would uh\nYou know don't let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us who want to use the barge would be a little bit more than I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire job nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole town\nIs there a way to keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever we're spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold should for denies doing five years instead of ten where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nUm it's that's that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know jobs or up created an additional burden on the taxpayer\nAnd in fact the six point five billion dollars which the legislation um proposes um towards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from a federal middle revenues and so this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there um but they're not\nEarmark on right now for national parks allocated to other programs but I'm legislation\nFederal budget expert either monitor but if the if money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bars right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down or adding that increased burden on the taxpayer and what it does is it is to identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national\nParks and and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar ... son and I think on the back in and you know you're talking funding um it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it and you know to that I went to I mean we'll we'll have the you know the statue\nOf liberty I Will be preserved and that has a a backlog a maintenance back lot right now Ellis Island\nAnd we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in our American story um you know that places like the\nLittle Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown v board of education at that you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean um we um had\nAn analysis done by the cat in this group and they found that if the if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impact\nLocally and caught economies at these national\nParks are part of and so I Would say you know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for with these local communities can get and the jobs they create um by just restoring places that we already know um are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing it\nUp you know ah right now there's a bipartisan support sauce on on both sides I think right now we're we're trying to get through and we're helping 'em to get this legislation passed\nIn the next month or two after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and and get to work around a around us so we're we're you know kind of caught into um the the bill is now in the legislation is now in sub committee that's coming out of that soon but we you know I Need to the Congress to act right now um to to get this passed for us\nSo it's something that they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with this saying we're we're not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that that is the case but [laughter] but but I\nYou know I Would also argue that yeah I I I'm a big huge preservation is in fact you know of course I work for the national trust 'em you know but you know preservation as a as a as a bipartisan I'm a you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats I guess ...\nWe all care about our heritage I just found that I think it would be

Britain we had to fight to keep the country together in the civil war we've had to fight off enemies of all kinds and in fact America\nFreedom from Great Britain we had to fight to keep the country together in the civil war we've had to fight off enemies of all kinds and in fact Americans fought at least a couple of times in the first and Second World War Z to be able to keep the country and the world safe\nAnd of course during the Cold War you know the war with no uh no shooting thank goodness we had to fight a client late to be able to prevail over an enemy that had vowed to our destruction\nSo the book why we fight by Dr Sebastian Gorka defeating America's enemies with no apologies is very very important as far as I'm concerned Dr ... it's a pleasure to have you back on the program\nThanks for having me alive\nYou begin by saying the apology tour is finally over before we get to what Donald Trump he's doing for America tell us what you think was done in the previous presidents tenure\nWell ah the Obama administration made a conscious decision very early on the big problems in the world are are America's fault whether it's global warming whether it's terrorism we are really to blame and that's why\nThe first things that President Obama did was to go on a global apology so well that\nThat ended on Saturday to threaten your last year that the previous\nEight years had seen\nAmerica withdraw from the world and the bad guys take the front seat whether it's Russia invading the Ukraine whether it's the rise of ISIS whether it's the ... minutes arising sign or whether it's the the the mullahs in Iran getting\nStrengthened by Obama's Iran deal that has been replaced with an America for strategy and that's good for all Americans and it's very good for our partners and allies as well\nI'm anxious to talk about what you think that a Donald Trump is doing I Know I have my own impression but you had the chance to work with him as a as a former assistant to the president but do you have any inkling as to why Americans didn't respond more forcefully\nWhen our previous president a bronco Obama decided that he would simply take America to second or third position and then we would no longer take the kind of preeminent role that we've taken for much of the last hundred years why didn't Americans react more\nI think if the cause we will allow the left take control of the political culture for the last forty years so you know as you think about the fact that the dean do and and ... as\nA became tenured professors in Chicago after being leaders of the weather and then on the ground terrorist organization when you think of the political correct with now controls Hollywood's\nThe major in general active deemed the press I I think that was a lot of brainwashing after I mean just look at the polls that the victims of communism foundation recently polled millennials and forty two percent of the millennials\nSaid they'd like to live in a socialist United States so if you see a Andrew Breitbart was so right if you if you see the the cultural a terrain than politics will follow\nAnd by the way bernadine during and bill airs it's worth noting that rock Obama launched his campaign from where the fundraiser and a get together at the home of billionaires who is as you point out a terrorist and and and for some reason\nConnections to other kinds of groups are frequently used uh to to a dam or to slur or a political candidate in that case\nOr his connection to bill layers which continued and he had quite a connection it wasn't just getting together and his home but he had he had quite a few connections to Bill Moyers in running out one of the ... education foundations that Morocco bomb was involved in before he became a U.S senator\nAnd Americans I guess ... or didn't know or didn't care\n[noise] well I you know I I don't know if they shrugged do didn't no didn't cash the media covered it off I mean Obama lives he said oh I don't I didn't really know bill as\nYou just live close by that's alive as as you said they were on the board of the same five oh one C. three foundation so when when when you have\nAlmost all the media in your back pocket that you can get away with all kinds of stuff I mean the the sick the funds and the ... of the media under the Obama years we've never seen any single life in America before\nI'm Talking to doctors bashing Gorka former deputy to the president of the United states Donald Trump his latest book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nSo let's talk about this to the left has has painted Donald Trump as a candidate and now still is trying to paint Donald Trump as president as a man who's going to take us into another war well your answer that criticism plays\nA open your eyes every body look around uh\nWe we have North Korea before the president came in to to the oval office continue to build a nuclear capability is legally launching ballistic missiles over the sea of Japan and now off the next five years thanks to Donald Trump we are on the cops\nThat potentially of ending the Korean War and not just with an armistice but with a peace treaty and just seeing the potential\nDenuclearize patience\nOf the whole peninsula look at look at Russia Russia is back in a box\nThey are trying to destabilize various regions around the world\nBut we have a president who says enough is enough we've even killed three hundred rushing less reason Syria to send a very strong message to Moscow that we will not allow you to destabilize important parts of the world\nAnd in fact today we're seeing a story breaking about possible assassinations by the Russians are by others are on ... in this in this world let me ask you a straight out question Dr ... got you study this for a long time\nIs it fair to say that probably every one of the countries on this planet of any size does engage in assassination from time to time not necessarily a political figures but\nPeople are killed you need to be killed to protect our national security you think as much as we might hate to admit it that that that probably does happen and that is not just Russia and China and other countries but that we do it as well [noise]\nI wouldn't say this is a widespread trends but\nIf there are no other options if your cattle extradite the international law actually permits\nIf somebody has committed a terrorist the trust of theories about two and they're on the ... the territory of another country\nIn that country refuses to ... extra die so that you are you permitted by international law to use deadly force against that individual that's one of the principals were used on the west off the bin Laden in Afghanistan in October\nOf two thousand to one\nSo yes I mean if if you're on national security is in jeopardy\nI was in the world so yes I mean if if your national security is in jeopardy you're not going to hold a press told friends or or how how that goes to ... with with a rogue regime if it's the survival of the nation may be at stake\nSo tell me that is what do we need to do to really make this country safe and fight back the way you write about\nWell look I I Am and why we fight or go through it reflects on free threat by threat whether it so I Know whether it's the that your hobbies whether it's Russia\nA first the first you have to rebuild them but we have to note yeah the ... we have to note that that's low in many cases you can do what they wish to do to America and then lo live which is why you know part of the book is why we fight them way up the stories of for American heroes that\nWe'd have to read this dealt with the will to win because you can have the best\nBut the Democrats will try to do everything possible to slow him down and to undermine his agenda\nDr ... can let me ask you about this this is a divided country and it's not just divided because the media says it's divided we see really serious a disagreement between people we've seen friendships and and\nAnd and perhaps even marriages dissolve over the disagreements over President Trump's occupy you know his position in the White House\nA can a country is divided is that be still be effective in meeting these challenges against our enemies around the world\nWe we have been more divided in the past remembers the biggest war we ever for was not\nWorld War two wasn't even Vietnam the greatest number of casualties more than half a million Americans killed was our own civil war a during Vietnam I Believe we were more divided so the idea that we've we've we've never been more divided I don't buy it but of course it makes\nThings difficult but I think more and more Americans are waking up to who Donald Trump is and how he wants to protect this nation from all threats and has to guarantee out for the first you stuff you know I Am an American now proud American and as a result I'm an optimist\nAnd I think that the ... the sleeping giant is awakening\nYou know it's funny Dr Gounder you say that because I I see people coming together in ways that I think even the mainstream media wouldn't have expected I went back last week and looked up uh the percentage of the black vote that Donald Trump got in twenty sixteen not quite two years ago and it was eight percent by the middle of last\nYear twenty Seventeen he was a twenty three percent almost three times the number\nThat he got ... votes in the election and this year he's already at thirty six percent\nThat kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media and that's on one of the most divisive issues that Americans face and that of race and whether or not a black American citizens feel they're being treated appropriately and equitably [noise]\nIt seems that an awful lot of black Americans on a huge percentage in percentage terms has decided this is the president we like\nYeah I think what did we see and twenty sixteen and incredible\nSilent majority the mainstream media said that Hillary has more than Ninety percent solves the wedding lasting posed as something like Ninety seven ... seven percent salt water how good she lost bottled Trump won I think in the last two years that they go\nOff of five to ... votes this can only have increased and that's why I remain very very called for them\nAnd yet the other side and especially the media player and the media is a big player in this seems willing to do almost anything even entertain a lines to win a fight like the fight that occurred over the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nYeah I mean in in in my book why we fight I talk about with the same as what it could chambers was was justice Kavanaugh before justice capital was even born\nSo you know in Nineteen forty eight a man who had been a form of communist agents stood\nUp in Congress and the festival televise the live testimony and told the world who the secret agents were communists inside government including ... his ah the left tries to destroy him they used to being a homosexual an alcoholic\nOr you know everything you can imagine and it was all live so that the Democrats have made a bargain with the devil the ends justify the means if you were shocked at what they did the Kavanaugh than you need to open\nBut I have made a bargain with the devil the ends justify the means if you were shocked at what they did the cabin law than you need to open a history book because they did it because ... they did it the jobs the jobs are you'll or are they did it to a with the ... back in Nineteen forty eight\nI'm Talking to doctors should bashing ... who's the author most recently of why we fight 'em before we wrap up this segment because I Want

standard just last week\nThere were folks who were I guess for lack of a better term gay shaming a Lindsey Graham ah by suggesting that ah that because he's a you know that that somehow he's he's homosexual\nAnd and that kind of treatment of people ordinarily get you shouted down these days in America if you decide to out somebody or ... suggesting that they're gay\nAnd yet the Democrats on the left she willing to do it and the media seems willing to amplified that as well\nBlog that doesn't get you shouted down it destroys your career if a conservative did to Lindsey Graham or the left\nOr if they can so the district called gay west what the left I mean think about it the left on of cable TV called Kanye West ... little negro anybody on the right that that that is would\nBe

history by Alan Greenspan and Adrian will drudge of course Alan Greenspan is the chair former chair of the council of economic advisors and the long term chair of the Federal Reserve board he served as chair of the council of council of economic advisers under President Ford\nAnd was appointed chair of the fed by President Reagan his co author Adrian ... who is with us this morning is the economists political editor his written some half a dozen previous books prior to capitalism in America a history well\nIt's a long history and we only have Fifteen minutes so I don't expect you to actually tell us this story altogether Mr world rich but\nI Would appreciate turning to the back of the book if I might and it is I mean I should note for readers is really reasonable it makes economic accessible and I really appreciate that\nI'd like to turn to the park is titled entered Trump where you have a few comments about President Trump but not a lot about this tax cut for corporations and for the upper one percent of taxpayers in the United states\nAnd I'm Wondering how you feel about and you and Mr Greenspan feel about this recent tax cuts whether it's good for the United states and whether it matters anymore now that the Republicans don't seem to care that we're going to have trillion dollar deficits yearly for as long as the eye can see what's what's your position on that\nWell I think the if you look at the American corporate tax rate\nUm which was a thirty five percent it was very high by global standards and not just high but dysfunctional because they sway a lot of American global companies to keep very large amounts of money offshore sitting that basically doing nothing um so you go to the ... trillion dollar cash\nMansions sending them money not being used for productive investments so I think there was everything to be that that the tax cuts but not for the top one percent of the\nCorporations um and if corporations are paying less corporate tax they have more money available for\nInvestments so that's not my massive water and I I I speak for myself not no not so don't degree and spend the that's what my wife and my worry is um the um unfunded entitlements you know the fact\nThat you're cutting taxes whilst a parking lots of going up in up in up it's it's like a balance and therefore you know a a deficit and it's actually not much of the\nDifficult to to to to close by deficit it's quite possible to do it by a mixture of raising the retirement age raising taxes a combination all of the two could you could bring you go to Columbia back into balance but just cutting taxes without ... without addressing the that the size and they should be talking with you know good policy making\nThe book talks about your your book with Alan Greenspan talks a lot about the supposed or what you fear is the lack of dinosaurs ... in the United states that we're no longer as a creative economy as we used to be\nMassive governmental intrusion into markets and I'm Wondering whether you would oppose that that is well\nNo not at all I mean one of the arguments you make in this book is because he got to look at the loan to run the show to look at the long term in in entitlements lonesome talking which is bankruptcy also look at the long term and climate change we didn't talk about it because there was a big enough book with a lot of stuff in it but I Would bet they massively in favor\nOf um intervening in that area but intervening using the price mechanism to price the extra knowledge as the costs of of of pollution\nAnd things like that but I think one of the reasons why businesses are becoming more and more reluctant to invest as they get more worried about a lot to the long term pulses of of climate change so that will that money\nSo you think that in a in a word that in fact the government has a significant role to play in combating climate change\n... three three of the prize mechanism but yes absolutely\nOkay we have to leave it there we've been speaking with Adrian ... new book with Dr Alan Greenspan is capitalism in America the history thank you so much for the book and thanks for your

sixth Massachusetts voters will decide the fate of the fate of question one which proposes to mandate staffing ratios\n... said any number of letters to the editor on this and anyone who has had the misfortune to watch some of the reasons a playoff games on television as seen any number of TV ads opposing question one the safe staffing ratio of nurses to patients in hospitals\nWe have with us to discuss question one this morning in the studio Don stern\nWho is co chair of the Massachusetts each nurses association bargaining unit Bay State medical center in Franklin she's a mental her health nurse and Suzanne love also co chairing the emergency department nurse and a union representative has well they are volunteers in the effort to pass a patient live limits in Massachusetts\nI let's start with Don stern and we'll go to Suzanne love a lot of bad\nA publicity uh generated paid for publicity for the most part opposing question one you support question one tell us why\nWell combining everyone and thank you bills thank you Monti for having us here today [noise] I support question one because I just want to do my job the best I can as a nurse and right now and caring for too many patients at one time\nThis bill is about setting safe patient limits on how many patients we care for at one time right now the only place where there are limits regulated limits by the law\nOr the intensive care unit anywhere out\nThere we have absolutely no say or control over how many patients we care for at one time and all the research clinical independent scientific research says when we care for too many patience is dangerous it's just dangerous and it's unnecessary\n[noise] the one state which has a law similar to that which is proposed question one is California ... has been a lot of debate about whether this law has worked in California and or what the effect has been tell us about that\nThat's a great question so let's let's talk about California California is how this law in place for over fourteen years\nI I think California's a great sample size um because it has over three hundred hospitals one out of seven people in the United states receive health care in California\nUh that's how big California's\nThe outcomes in California have been fantastic so for example Massachusetts his number forty eight out of fifty for wait times in the emergency room\nCalifornia is a times or forty seven percent faster since they put this law in place a their hospital based infections have have gone down significantly\nThese are forty seven percent faster since they put this law in place a their hospital based infections have have gone down significantly high rates of re admission have gone down significantly rates of death medication areas these are all related to nurse staffing\nLet's go back from it question one says what about staffing what is the actual provisions return Suzanne of culture bring suit of armor nurse proponent of question one helpless\nQuestion what lessons have the right the right number of patients per nurse when these patients are in the hospital and what's the right number\nSo if you look at so people have asked this question many many times like well how did you come up with a number\nSo it's a combination of over Twenty years of research and looking at California's outcomes and also working with bedside nurses\nAre across the state for years it's based on the unit that you're on so for example most people are familiar with medical surgical units so right now you can have\nA a let's say at Franklin on average those nurses are caring for if I don't know six seven patients down in Bay state Springfield\nThey're caring for eight or more all the research and the outcomes say that that nurse shouldn't have up to four patients at one time on a psych unit like mine it would be up to five\n... in in the emergency room Suzanne it would be up to three patients three to four patients so that's specifically related to the unit you are on it's very unit specific in addition the bill\nSo it's three in the ER for\nOn a medical surgical up to four because the the opposition would like to tell you that that's a rigid rigid number and what we're saying is it's up to four and the law also talks about using acuity tools\nSo right now I promise you as a nurse when I'm caring for too many patients at one time\nThere is no autonomy I don't have any freedom I'm just running around hoping I can do the very best than that I can this law would allow me\nTo use acuity tools my clinical judgment and say you know what right now my patients are so sick that I think I can safely take care of for versus five so there is flexibility within those numbers but it's up to four on a medical surgical for\nBut it does have some does correctly she has litters would have flexibility so in the emergency department I could say my patients are stable people come to the emergency department for many different reasons\nOh my God we have less than thirty he goes to do this and they're you know January one oh my God we're never going to need it\nSo there's two points that I Want to make about that just because in a a law become goes into effect on a particular date or\nIt doesn't actually mean it's in effect yeah like where's my potshots exactly mighty so and I I'm Sorry for your Monti\nYes and I don't feel sorry for money but but ... who advised somehow but I Do think it's important to note this because this has gotten lost an entire discussion which is\nThe proposition ... has the same legal status as any other law passed by the legislature and the legislature can amend it and it can change it and so if there's a problem it's not written in stone this is not a constitutional amendments it's\nA law it is and so let's talk about\nOkay goes in January one\nThe I promise you this guy's not going to fall um what has to happen next we'll have to go to the health policy commission all the regulations have to be figured out not only that but all the hospitals have to submit plans on implementation\nThe acuity tools have to be designed and worked out with the nurses and the administrators\nAnd all of that is going to take months and months and months and months just like you said\nOkay so this idea that and it's sort of your vision is to veto bingo and you know\nThat there's going to be a ... when this passes and as you can hear me say when this passes because it's the right thing to do when this passes there is going to be a period where we're going to have to fight to make sure\nThat the revisions don't destroy the integrity of what the bedside nurses have written because this is really about your safety the other thing I Want to say to\nThe other argument that people are saying well there aren't enough nurses\nBecause this is really about your safety the other thing I Want to say to the other argument that people are saying well there aren't enough nurses how are we ever going to need this so I\n... I I I Love this interview or you have to answer my own questions and you\nKnow it's like why do run out of us\nAre really a lot of fun you know I like about I Would I Would love you I should\nSpeak about the both of those questions and one is the claim that or lack of nurses so this was impossible to fill this hole in any event and then let's get to the money because ... she uses a number of today I've never heard ... nurse Steffi ratios would costs about a billion\nDollars and all that much of which well now let's talk about\nThe nurses first jerk then I'll talk about the money and then the most important thing though about this interview though is about patient safety and there is nobody better to talk about patient safety than Suzanne so but I'm going to I'm going to talk about the nurses are going to talk\nAbout a month right because the first officer winners was there's a claim nurses shortage of nurses in Massachusetts and is this all goes into effect medical centers hospitals are not going to be able to hire the nurses because they're not there what's the answer to that\nIn many parts of our country there is a nursing shortage there's two states that do not have a nursing shortage Massachusetts in North Dakota we graduate three thousand five hundred thousand three thousand five hundred nurses in this state a year just in the eye Ninety One court or\nFrom Springfield to Greenfield there's six schools with seven programs there's plenty of nurses those with severe nursing program nursing program at UMass has to nursing programs so there are\nPlenty of nurses in Massachusetts other parts of the country not the case\nSo there are enough nurses nurses have left the bedside at the hospital because it's just too stressful it's scary sometimes to have too many patients who are sick of trying to juggle who\nI have four things I should be doing right now they're all things I should be doing right now it's hard to decide which one I'm going to do sometimes what everybody needs something from me\nAnd this will allow that this will this bill will allow patients have the right level of care hospitals will be able to hire nurses there'll be able to bring nurses back to the bedside nurses went\nBack to the bad side when this law passed in California a hundred thousand return to the bad side and California's\nBedside nurses as opposed to some other ... yes federal vendors as\nYet inside nurses and somebody that for one reason ... nurses have left the hospital is they will do a lot of them to being part time positions people need full time work with benefits\nWas talking about yes I'm Sorry one\nOther thing I Want to cause cause Suzanne answer that question beautifully\nOr the other thing I Want to add to is Massachusetts has one of the largest group of nurses working part time or pre DM which is a you know on a casual basis who would love fulltime work\nBut the hospitals will not post those positions because they don't want to pay for the benefits they just do this is a a cost saving measure it's cheaper to have\nPre DM nurses in part time nurses so they don't have to pay for health benefits or anything else and this would actually\nMake them [noise] have to post full time positions\nOkay which will get us to the money now in Studio ... she claims quote nurse staffing ratios costs about one billion dollars annually this entire taxes her health insurance premiums and the whole breed horrible yeah what's your response to that\nSo I'm gonna I'm going to talk to you about the actual costs and then I'm In uh in Massachusetts and then I'm also going to talk to you about the outcomes in California so I'm not surprised that sue wrote that no ah that letter and not surprised\nThat it is it is also a code sun co authored by the uh a chair of the board of service\nOkay so these are executives okay so they're aligned with hospitals executives and the corporate dollars so I think it's really important for the listeners to just make sure that we understand who wrote that letter\nOkay I'm In terms of money\nSo we're not really sure where they keep coming up with this figure we've asked for their their numbers we we can't get a straight answer for them so independent research was done out of Boston College and the independent research out of Boston College says okay and again this is not something we pay for\nIndependent academically reviewed rigorous\nStudy said that this bill will not costs more than forty seven million dollars a year which means on average for every hospital that's three percent three percent of their budgets\nWhich is a drop in the bucket so think about based aid for example they may Seventy million last year Seventy million dollars they pay their top executive\nOver two million dollars a year so this is not about money or a lack of money there is plenty of money to pay for this so this idea that somehow it's going to cost a billion dollars is ludicrous\nThe other the other I I'm guessing she got that number\nIs we are definitely disappointed in the health policy commission we chose them to do the implementation help us do the implementation of this law when it passes because we thought that they were independent watchdog it turns out\nThat the health policy commission net behind closed doors with hospital executives\nThe hospital executives turned around\nGave him these ridiculous ridiculous numbers and then the health policy came out and said we have the numbers on how much this is costing this is independent\nThere was nothing independent about it when you don't bring both sides to the table to actually look at the numbers there's nothing independent about it so that billion dollars is ludicrous it's ludicrous bill there is no fact there is no study it's all inflated numbers\nThat were given by the hospital association\nIt seems at each time we hear them talk about how much this little costs of the cost goes up I haven't\nI've

percent interest you know have made fun of the four giant monster mega banks that account for roughly half of deposits in the United states does or chase Citibank a Wells Fargo and bank of America\nThat are paying nearly zero on savings well is worse even then I thought the dish into that\nThere's more than one in four dollars people have on deposits in banks cause pain nothing zero point zero zero percent\nNow that is loco in its time that interest rates are rising and you without really even\nA finger much one can take what you're earning up to round two percent and that two percent is only going to go up over time highest rates around about two and a quarter you probably heard me\nOver time and calls all get from people about putting money in online banks all the action

they want to be where they are instead of may prisoners compelled to remain where they are one of the most egregious things though\nAbout so many covenants not to compete in the United states in so

that is so wrong there is no great to what there is no question that that is out of line\nWhen does with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Linda\nHow are ya\nGreat thank you wonder you have a son in high school\nI Do how how's it going\nTo [noise] um no but I Will you know you know the age\n[laughter] so you're not as smart as you used to be somehow\nOh no I'm hoping that comes back at some point [laughter]\nIt does in fact one of the things that will amaze you is that your child will tell you later that you have become so much smarter than you used to be\nYes I like I'm only help and for those days [laughter]\nIt's kind of and don't worry\n[laughter] hey I Want to start by thanking you about something I have been listening to you for a few years and recently I opened an online bank account and then afterwards by two weeks later I was listening to you were talking about a thousand dollar incentive to do so by the same bank\nSo I called up immediately and I I Am eligible led by like skin Mikey by two days you just made me a thousand bucks I Would never know if I hadn't listened to\nWow okay so that deal is now gone so I don't even know if I should mention ... what the deal was since no one else can get the thousand you've got but I'm Glad that you grabbed it when we had that out there\nYeah I have I did notice that I'm On their website so that was awesome thank you\nSure well we can say the mother money let's see if I can help\nSo I my husband and I think then um my son was born he now so he's a freshman\nSo it got four years to go and she was saying there are giving me a little and you know one is that market right now you know seeing as the timeframe that we're now under the second is that we live in New Hampshire which is the second highest in state college choice in the country average college tuition here is thirty grand so\nWhat you got to do the other side of the story though for your fellow Americans that is that New Hampshire has overall lower taxes than most other states\nWhere is that ...\nThat is truly don't have any income tax but they all get you in ways that are I pay huge amount and property taxes we watched it out I think in the end [laughter] okay it's a great place to live though I'm not complaining about my state okay\n[laughter] so we have about last week we had a hundred and thirty five thousand the account today we have a hundred and twenty eight\nOh because of the market decline what what are you invested in in the five twenty nine are you in the ... a space portfolio or are you in something\nThat we are an age based portfolio and I looked in preparation to call and it you know fifty percent well only thirty one percent stocks bonds at fifty one percent\nSo they've already taken that into account but I get nervous considering I think we have most of the money we're going to need help ally so I'm just wondering when cash preservation comes into play versus growth\nWell you're shallow breathing I can get it right\nSo you may be at that point you know I Would I Would encourage you to stay age base because we don't know at what point the market does go through a serious decline and since you're the point that the movement in the market only has a thirty percent effect on the college money\nI Would encourage you to stage base except I've heard you loud and clear you've got the money you're going to need so going into a fund the just preserves the cash is fine for you to do and then you'll just rest easy\nThrew his four years of college\nThat was kind of my love and when they were four hours come freshman year [laughter] one problem at a time right right\nSo you know if you know most people are not in the position that you were in that you've already been able to save a hundred percent of the cost of undergraduate school and since you have done that then forget it\nAble to save a hundred percent of the cost of undergraduate school and since you have done that then forget the classic advice I Would give of being in the age based\nMix and just go in to the the thing that will preserve the money and you won't have to worry the next four years\nAnd so even going in by them and that could potentially lose money too right\nYeah mine is interest rates rise on bonds which they are the value of bonds you hold go down you've got enough years that the higher interest rate should counteract likely\nSome of the decline and the value of those bonds but again you've already hit the goal line you've already got it okay you've already scored the touchdown so if you want to just a take victory laps for four years do it\nAnd you learn a little puny amount and the and the preservation find you might earned a couple of percent a year and that will help a little bit with the cost of inflation and tuition over the next few years to just take that victory lap\nI Am writing as we speak right\nBest to you and the science you got a thousand dollars on that savings bonus tan is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Ted\nHey Clark how're you doing today\nGreat thank you Ted you or I had to end about wind you've been trying to get to for a while tell me how long this path of getting rid of debt has taken you\nAh well we started really seriously about three years ago and um we had three credit cards within our whole it\nTotal and we're we're actually paid off too and we are in the process of getting the third one paid off by November\nCongratulations facet\nYeah we're kind of excited about that it's been a been a dark cloud over us for a few years so but I Do have a question of what we pay off the third and final credit card should we keep one of those accounts active all three of them active or should we just cancel all three\nYou want to keep all three active\nUh-huh and that's really key to your credit score your credit score has been rising probably all through this three year pay down process is using less and less severe available credit if you close the counts it will actually affect your credit score negatively because it will show less available credit\nIn your credit score and mix so are you going to be tempted though to use them\nIf the accounts say open and you don't want to do\nEither I I don't think so unless like something major happens um we really because you are really more of a cash you\nCould cut them up but we I accounts opened so you'd rather prevented from using the cards\nAnd you would have the benefit of having the cards active it'll be a a decent while before\nAny of the three credit card operators decide you've been an active too long and they are going to end voluntarily close your account\nOf American Life does run for a while the ideal thing would be twice a year to use each of the cards for one small transaction and that we keep them totally active and you wouldn't have to worry about an issue we're trying to get rid of you\nOkay congratulations to you on the discipline living on less than what you make so you could pay off this that that was just it sounds like it was a burden in your life\nIt was and are a target date as the spring of two thousand Twenty one will be totally debt free\nCongratulations on

L. winter jacket on wish for me ... and it was too small for me and I'm now and I'm In every size man [laughter] five XL too small\n[laughter] so [laughter] so whatever size you think you're going to need some of the some of the items now and wish because of the complaints about the seizing issue now have a guide to try to help you translate\nThe seizing that they put on the garment in China with the seizing that would ... be equivalent to what we would have in the United states\nOkay for them but I was back out those things the prices on\nOn wish in particular you to be rubbing your eyes like I'm not reading that right am I Can't really be that price evaluating well\nYeah anything to save money 'cause I mean the prices at the mall they are just outrageous\nYeah well I mean there are lots of options between the mall and buying stuff from these Chinese website [laughter] and if you've not done the Plato's closet visit I suggest that if you have one near you\nWe do so we will check that out\nOkay best of luck thank you sure\nAnd Mike is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike\nHi Clark thanks a lot for taking my call today\nCertainly Mike how can I be of service to you\nWell we got a a trip to Europe was going to go to Italy we're going to fly to Italy spend a few days down in southern Italy and then the parole and take a cruise no more than a Mediterranean and I don't want to take a lot of cash\nA which these even got a I think he got a lot better [noise] ... so\nI don't know all of them have I got hit in Madrid\nBy a too violent criminals and like an idiot I went after them and I got my wallet back and uh many listeners were extremely upset with me that I Would do something that stupid 'cause that could have been dead on the on the street in Madrid\nSo it's better if you do get his best just to let them have whatever it is they want\nYou know what I'm looking at is a ATMs everything I read it looks like a key and those are the best way to go on\nAnd I have a deal to banks and I knew ... information one says it's a five dollars flat sea and that's it the other one says it's a a five dollar C. plus three percent of the law for two weeks\nAgo and it's got to be one of the giant monster ...
