unusually aggressive because of the Chinese warship across the bow of the Decatur and came within forty five yards when it did so that's just seconds away from a collision and that could have been catastrophe\nWay welcome to voices who helped us who will help us understand these unusual occurrences\nThat are happening in China and in Hong Kong and on the high seas\nSouth China sea first of all

do any age him being [noise]\nI'm John bats are Gordon Chang my colleague and co host and we are very pleased in the studio to have with us mark Clifford the former editor of the south China Morning post he's a resident of Hong Kong and he's traveled here to New York to sit with us\nAs well as sea hunt cameras a master's candidate in the program for higher education at\nThe University of Rochester but also as an observer of influenced by the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSay who you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you we're organizing an event on campus who was the event for so the event was pretty much for\nIn the university wasn't open event\nIffy and it was meant to sort of um spread this idea of dialogue on campus\nAnd dialogue with whom I mean who who are the people are going to be at the event\nSo I'm as I said before it it is although was open for everybody I wanted to use I wanted to purposely use the Tibetan issue as an example because of the fact that the Tibetan issue mainly focuses on on having dialogue with those that you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by setting that by sending that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give a everybody a chance to participate to get to know about the issue and of course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students\nSo wants to give them a choice I give them an opportunity also too\nYou know I could get to know the Tibetan issue I'm\n... and that's why that's an issue to bet I'm they drink believes is a part of the People's Republic of China it sits in the south western portion very strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em\nAnd Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they're part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence facts\nAt least since two thousand and they the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing that can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities at the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the facts that we have about uh the persecution\nHis holiness the dollar Lama the spiritual leader of the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAnd who's complain of what he's called and what many people agree is cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to a limited Tibetan the density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both\nTried to Ron and American campus what happened\nWell you know it's it's not a I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because you know my primary goal was to live out this whole principle that you know we can talk about any issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agreed to disagree or or to agree to a great\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely use the Tibetan issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves\nThere by living out the principles of what it needs to be at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the University of Florida's new about it because of course ... it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good central location on campus ... what happened immediately before there are\nSo I'm up until I guess a day before the event um or even a even a little bit before that everything was uh going as planned um I was told that the hosting student organization\nI'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host event for me but to help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my ... so my event was set on the thirty first of march and on the night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sends me a screen shot of an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese student association has had received ... concerns from uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community\nAnd that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it said on the email that they will lead they ... at both the university and the student administration or know about this\nNow a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know a we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something worse might happen and I told them you know what you know this is the United states what could happen you know it's I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar\nUm ... it just says they're they're free to they're free to go and complain and I don't\nSee anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and to reserve or that event\nOn campus um sent me an email saying that the hosting your organization all of a sudden withdrew their support\nFor this event which are the sponsorship for this event and henceforth um this event was cancelled and on at the end of the emails she even noted that um she suggested that I I I moved to vent from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your vet and Turks you off campus well\nI I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um you know take that step but uh to to the eyes of many people it might look that way and I've gotten has a lot of smoke around here fight [laughter]\nRight [noise] but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but\nYou know I I just I it it's it's I was so upset not because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we\nI personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values as Americans as as as people were living under slant um to have to practice this idea that this this right of free speech who says\nThat was just so hard voted according to who made the phone call um soon who made the phone the phone call I mean what do you say who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who watch it\nI I can only I can only guess at this point um maybe maybe it was maybe with some very upset student on campus maybe it was a ... the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of ...\nAnd let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer what Senate come to well we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em\nA suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying nice party in the ballroom drinking champagne eating canopies whatever\nThe snake doesn't have to do very very much everybody knows it's there it reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake those what it does but it keeps everybody\nAll right John there's another part to this story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to go back to it because this was an issue of what an campus administration is doing and what a tried to do to cover its tracks\nGordon Chang the database mark Clifford as a former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say whoa and Kim to tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations but I think everybody just started not only in the United states but around the world\nThe anaconda I'm John ...

I mean during the during the event of Seventy yes I'm so basically my speaker who is representing the office of Tibet at that time I'm actually\nGave a gave this comment that all Tibetans wants to do\nIs to have a dialogue with all sides especially with the Chinese are authorities and the Chinese people\nThat's so sweet did he mentioned the self immolations yes he mentioned to sell that sent off guard and that doesn't well certainly\nBecause that shows that the Tibetans are not happy in that Beijing's rule is essentially occupation way ...\nSay it's a terrific story thank you say ... and all the college is and all the universities and all the professors and all the students get it exactly\nGordon Chang of the Daily Beast block Clifford former editor of the south China Morning post and also our guide to anaconda villa when we come back we'll return to it I'm John national\nMm [noise]\n[noise] this corporate profile minute has brought you buy metallic minerals corporation that exploration company focused on the advancement of its high grade silver project in Canada's Yukon Territory metallic minerals holds the second largest land position in the legendary Gino Silber district\nClose to one of the world's highest grade silver projects and slightly over two hundred million ounces of ultra high grade historic production the twenty Seventeen drool result\nConfirmed the projects great potential entered exploration campaign is underway\nCEO break Johnson is leading a highly experienced team focusing on this exceptional silver asset with excellent infrastructure in a top world famous jurisdiction this corporate profile but it has been brought to you by metallic minerals corporation ...

who is the system be used against and really there's only one country that system is likely to be the game tonight to China\nWhich is why I think it's perhaps not as concerning for Washington and last month um the sector they compare and had Secretary Mattis we're in Delhi signing a much more important agreement\nWhich is a a Comcast said which is that communication agreement with Delhi\nWhich will dramatically increase in proper ability between the Indians and the Americans\nAnd I'm sure that the sale was discussed during those meanings and if the U.S has had very serious concerns they would have been addressed at that time so there there's the legal possibility for sanctions but given the politics I I Would hope that there wouldn't be any\nYou have to put a little context as the United states sanction China for Boeing that's seen as four hundred a\nDuty aircrafts system from the I'm from the Russians and and clearly I don't I Can't see the U.S sanctions in India and that must be as you point out a sign of enduring partnership between do you in Washington\nAs these two countries started to work much more closely um but you know ... seems to be playing a very interesting game of outreach not only to boot and not only to the United states but also to China what's going on there clue\nSo the the China focus has always or or you know been overtly economic in India needs investments um it was hoping to get quite a bit of investment from Japan it and it's gotten some investment from Japan\nBut Modi in order to be reelected and you know there are elections coming up in the spring of twenty Nineteen really needs to deliver on things like job [laughter] that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and the goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement\nWith that the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd clearly has Modi gotten the investments you expected from the United states\nIt has been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationship so\nUm when weapons sales are involved\nUm you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and um people in stem who um have vested interests and other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brush in order to get things that are good for the strategic quarter of a nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected\nThe puzzle about vitamins and does she have a neutral image in Delhi is she regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very long during the kind of so called non aligned period India's not aligned period um they didn't get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all\nSo um there is you know it it's not considered a problem\nAnd um I think there was during during the time when um\nThe west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan um the Indian knew that this ... hottest problem would flow back to India and were I'm not averse to working with the Soviet strict not time either to try to contain it\nSo a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with our hottest on one side and the problem with China and the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nIncluding ... what is the state of flu between a Islam about them do it today\nOh it's that terrible uh and in fact what China did\nI'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the um missile defense system was hit announce it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan so essentially opening up a second front for that missile system to try to defend ... from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russia card if that's what their play this can be a dangerous came the Russians are not easy to work with you that forgotten the Soviet days does that regard it is that was all that was damaged is now is that the fresh thinking\nNot really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well a lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff ... way of putting it\n[laughter] so um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious problem is that a lot\nThat that Russia sold India has not been great equality hadn't been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery so the actual quality of what's been sold in the hot has it been a real problem\nYes I Wonder if they're going to send all those all broken soup ... and ... back to Moscow for her money back I'm not sure they'd make right\nNow there are by garden or the subcontinent becomes much more um the great game here with Russia entering into us\nOh you know whoever wins India as a partner is

while most new the cause of the Cold War two percent said\nClimate change and on and on it went now uh\nYou know the one thing just a few minutes ago that I'd like to return to that is the the notion of how we teach history or of course uh uh there's one line that comes back to me from a by grade school days stays with me to this this very day I suppose some day it could be the litmus test for died my dementia\nDue I in fact remember credit fourteen hundred Ninety to allow the sale the ocean blew\nA uh it it did certainly put that the data in my head and if you couple that with a few other facts I guess it's an important thing to know but but you're right there was a lot of rote memorization yes\nThat's entirely true it's the primary way in which we teach students history here too and most of our text books are written it's the way most estate exam germ it taught most state exams cared for and\nIt's the kind of knowledge Kurt students might have for the test\nBut it's real hard to think of it interesting duty for the industrial revolution that matches Columbus selling the ocean below so that um\nStudents really the only game that kind of understanding and it's a real issue in

for example had Abraham Lincoln not been elected president and they deemed sixty or our history would have been dramatically changed in all likelihood so\nThese are important I think that it doesn't strike me that it's impossible to to teach this way is it\nIs and they're already programs around the country that are doing this or their simulation fair game for the last three years for foundation in teaching history teachers in schools\nHow to teach using game harrowing video games or more importantly let's go back to your Lincoln example so Lincoln arrives in Washington he's had to sneak into Washington to avoid the assassination attempts\nHe arrives at the White House\nAnd we can could think of all of history as a negative all we can can think of the people who had those jobs ... figures added from prehistoric going Lincoln arrives he's\nA flesh and blood man who comes from the mid west to Washington DC and he's running against three other people and certainly doesn't have the support

Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tag and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain it or not moving very quickly with like Florence and they were sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas a leaf in a fast moving stream like um\nLike Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window over ah area for a longer period of time and that has capability or in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of the wind you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow in the past\nI see so many other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's lamb speed you write not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nNo it isn't\nWell our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants there or continue to move across a Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan tang of this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they lived at all these terms like a ... we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ... and early know what that is but it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a\nWith a with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess they had no hardly watch today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and that it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether to reject a extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the Atlantic um we often times see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction and then well form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\nYeah and that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the uh the atmosphere is is a a ... the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to farm for hurricanes to for\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and so is there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers it can't crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you could put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago it it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and that needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a a more powerful and um we we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked a bit at the tropical cycle information or this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the [laughter] [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression why do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight an intensely changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical sites on production that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feel with ... that is as you as you said for kind of the warmer ocean waters that a light below the ... are both below the hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for us to power when is it a store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself or are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes or portions of the planet where are all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf they're the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of it's OK hurricanes in the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the western Pacific and psych phones yeah the store generic cycling as the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes the way which is why in the science community we just referred to everything out the ... phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nVery urban up All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather uh and uh also in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five\nFour six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tang an assistant

New Jersey and I was like a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much reference ever given to hurricane Camille all ... nine right that was five and nothing after\nI had never been worse or I think a lot of each other storm hit and getting a wrong intensity as comparison get Camille\nAnd then got even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were tankers ever African freighters barges on highway Ninety\nAnd I think that in that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or health insurance hangs how I was wondering if you can comment on the fact that I'm getting no reference for the area of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot lot of people these days I don't remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right that the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because I've been on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that you know\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that ... I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of that so I mean I'm\n... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came from a little not to ...\nTo ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area\nI'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and um by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but\nI'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you\nPrepare and emergency kit and and it's it's been like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of ... and uh it almost eight my car uh seriously it hit the war way up to the side of the of the some land by a stream bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally have I if I had not gone to lead the lot where this car was\nAnd moved it I buy my car I could not get into the car the driver's side but I I moved

previous caller a doctor dragnet is about our our propensity for building in areas of the frankly just are safe and I've often wondered about that I mean what when you see a condo that it's virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean I mean\nYou are just pure begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why was zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire hey I bought the ocean front well I'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that just foolish this\nYeah you do touch on to the you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed\nMore and that um you know where the terms of um how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes have your narrow fault line [noise]\nUm but in in terms of um who is responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance um the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through of the federal program or a private company that offers sort of flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who you know pays for that that catastrophe poll or when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be uh the changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's yeah it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm\nA you know it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to sort of craft legislation on terms of um there there are caps on insurance premiums another sort of policies that they can put out\nAnd my grandma ... they're a little stupid\nI anything and I hung out you know like that makes it really\nCan don't have to worry about where

you think about this and you sit down I I Know you you had to be in the ... the the night of law\nAnd probably you saw that coming I mean Joe really the support for Joe was a pretty overwhelming [laughter] when you reflect about this about the campaign itself and what what's at stake here you've had a couple of weeks now to think about and what what are your thoughts right now\nThe process of talking to people across western mass it in place that's my home place I care very much about was was a really good process I mean yeah it was grueling and a lot of\nHot days knocking on doors and [laughter] um but also a lot of things I remember fondly and are happy to have done it and I've congratulated Joe course and actually are we spoke recently about working together on as as many things as possible and\nCertainly for things that affect the city of Northampton and um I think Chelsea also\nRented a good race and so did a Steve and so what can you say that's that's life but it was something that may in life you have to you have to try and I genuinely care about public service so I gave it a I gave it a shot and I feel not all that bad about the outcome to be honest I Wish I had one but this is a write in campaign and I was outspent by\nI don't know why the eight nine ten to one or something like that when all is told given that the number of people who walked into the voting booth and wrote the words brio down on a piece of paper\nWas actually really nice you know um and I think there are many more who I met who might have voted for me it and if things were different so so that's okay and I think we could representation in our in our area I mean that's the point I mean\nYou know obviously his personal disappointment but the real issue is moving forward as a region and fighting for a strong progressive policy in the legislature and I think everyone's committed to doing that so from that perspective I feel good about\nOur direction the decision you made when you first to announce your candidate see for up your car seat and a half year first district to eventually won by Lindsey suffer does or and or you were in that race for a brief time and then the Senate race came up Rosenberg got out and then you switch to that are looking back on that you are used to stand by your city\nOh yeah you know it's um I guess you can always second guess yourself but I'm such a strange confluence of events you wouldn't expect to happen I mean two vacancies that we're in you know pretty much one entirely unexpected and tragic in cases of Peter\nAnd then the other one also a somewhat of a surprise you know and so ... you know ... it's one of those things and you make the best decision that you you can at the time political calculus and then there's just you know doing you know pursuing the thing that you think is is the best fit for you so\nUm yeah again I'm good experience and you\nMust have been that the sticking neck out like that and a lot of people do appreciate that sort of thing I remember a a guy who lived on ... street I just ... years ago and he had a Maureen Carney sign on his lawn and a proponent\nUh-huh because the guy was a nice guy came up and shook his hand you're going to vote for him he said I'm already committed in Marin County but he said for anybody to stick his neck out and run for office he he's a good egging my boy so he really put a sign it along to it\nWas funny we demonize public service salon I used to have a president of the United states who is a politician protests like he's not and kind of demonize has to be but\nYou know uh I Do think that serving in that way is is and can be a noble pursuit and so I I agree with you I think for anyone who steps forward that's why I congratulate you know even the people I ran against um uh it's it's very important to ah to do that and have a discussion\nThe debates were pretty significant or we had a debate here with back when you were six candidates right where they had a lot of debates and the substance of those debates I mean you couldn't go wrong I mean if people listen to that\nBecause it basically one of my favorite part yeah no I I felt comfortable in that in that element you know I tried to talk about specific\n... state policy some specific ideas and um it's difficult because you know how many people actually go to those debates you know when you think about it even if you have an overflow crowd what percentage that is that of the actual electorate may be kind of a small percentage all my opponents did well I think the issues we ... we discuss were important to talk about\nLarry Roberts from Southampton has a letter to the editor and that goes out and uh he called upon that gives out to conclude is policy of endorsing candidates and said you do a great job interviewing people and publicizing their stances of candidates\nThere is no pure community need for endorsements washing the handful staff used the power circulation to influence\nThe public to this election's I've had trouble with endorsements I don't really understand them I I Do indoors people endorsed you I ... court in in New Hampshire second [laughter] I don't do it all the time newspapers feel a compulsion to do it\n... ... what is your thing and I I Know that can go the wrong way or the you know in endorsements can mean something again that didn't do that for instance endorsed Murray McCourt she didn't win\nSo how important are endorsements\nAre and if you think they're necessarily I think endorsements can be important if there are connected to other factors as well um you can't run a terrible campaign and get a lot of endorsements and still expected when you have to have a good campaign as well but if you do I think they can be actually a very significant um especially if you have you know in the political world view of\nAnd I don't use is just this tournament a negative way but the establishment you know the people who we know interactive is and are known to the community and will help if you have that and you're a good candidate and a good campaign that can be very powerful for newspapers\nAnd it's interesting question yeah 'cause they are using their ... it's the it's the right to do so I'm I'm seldom surprise at newspapers choose to indoors it's not really a shock it's kinda like oh you saw that coming from that perspective it's not that much of a game changer as the guy I so surprised because that shows X Y and ... ...

of course but these are just a simple creatures\nThey are although they are the flavorful they're playful they are they're known as the mollusks with a personality\nBecause they they live just usually they live just below the low tide line\nSo often the water is shallow enough that you can actually see them in the water and they love to dart around because they they use their um abducted muscle which is what we eat to open and close their show that's how they propel around now some scarves actually live like a like a\nA toy store and they attach themselves to something and they just spend their whole life\nAttached to appear or a rock or music or something but most of them around and they have they they just they they're fun to watch this is a almost tragic I mean when you think of it and I mean these are fun loving creatures\nAnd we hope I'm up to the skin mopping chow in down town down here which is why we should eat the rule of thumb is to eat them rarely and few of them when we do because they are in danger in fact in Europe they're highly regulated and people\nAre very expensive and people generally only eat them out in a restaurant\nAnd you are or usually a serving as for which is why these days off and they will cut them across the equator so you'll get you'll be served eight and if they're really only are for sale upstairs cut each cut in half and sometimes these days though even cut them into thirds\nSo that they can stretch the quantity of them here you know it's the it's all you can eat it's just really ridiculous in a different attitude about our uh our right to eat whatever we want to but that being the case it's still\nIt's still there are still plenty of them obviously because they they live all the way from\nVirginia the Carolinas and the Gulf of Mexico even all the way up into the bay of Fundy which is of course where did he is which is the\nScholar capital of the world while\nSo when you have a big huge tied like that then their territory is

[laughter] and find a lot of people won't eat veal ... you know because they picture that that yeah you know leaping around his mother we'll he grows up like that then we come and get him and it's not quite so bad for some reason if that's like weird\nThat's weird I mean cows are like so cool but anyway we digress into the circumstance covered ... yeah yeah yeah yeah but anyway ... one of the things about scarps that one needs to know is that when they're fresh they should not smell\nAnd when they're starting to go off they will smell and if they've started to go off you really shouldn't eat them they should be fresh they should be fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh they should never be frozen although most of the time they are because they're often or usually they're always in this country shocked on the boat and then ... and actually there's never been a machine figured out to shock\nA scholar they're all stuck by hand so that people on the boat actually\nUh actually suck all the scallops and then they they tend to freeze them right away so they do get a little watery\nBut that they freeze them pretty efficiently and what you shouldn't do is you shouldn't re freedom because what happens then you get a lot of that watery liquid in the bottom of the ... and and then they lose some flavor when you go to ... if you if you go to rinse them before you're cooking which you don't really need to do just like you don't need to rinse chicken or turkey any more\nThan a ... you should do it really quickly and you should never soak them because if you soak them while the flavor will just all go away and they'll be even milder than they are well how would you describe the taste the taste is\nJust us just very slightly brainy an ocean e and very mild and they shouldn't be sweet there should be a sweetness to them which is why you cook them very simply having\nAnd he was good but not as Brian is most other seafood and that's because their life cycle isn't that long you know there were only lived to be two to five years of the most although they will live to be Twenty years old if we let them do what they they don't get a chance to do that so most of the sculpture or about two years old when we eat them\nAnd they so they just never develop a ... you know strong flavor which is\nTrue with any thing whether it's vegetable or animal if it's younger it's going to have a mild flavored generally yeah you know it's not it's not a hundred percent but where they get bigger if you leave him alone no not really no they grow most of their mass and the first six months or so after the first six months they're really just cruising\nAnd they just sort of stay the same and one of the ways to tell if they're real ... is a real big market in fake ... as a bigger fish and they'll take the cheek of the fish to stamp out a scarf\nYet really oh yeah I like how you can do is if you when you buy a quantity is at least\nSome of them should have that little crescent shaped\nMuscle on the side and offer them the rest of it ... and ... they take a lot of those fall off or they take 'em off when they struck him but they always leave some so that you'll know that the real scarps no you shouldn't eat those where you can eat those are edible it's like the rind on ... you know it is that it will but\nThe the two two here and they get stuck in your T.

can remember because there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines in the world called Ryan air and Ryan air was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything\nAnd so Europeans have been way ahead of us on wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges\nWell that's great well thank you very much and I'm going to check out the website and of course the outlet store\nYes or anywhere else you should buy other than the discount you can

O. D. I. and Rick Cody itself is not illegal at all the things that people are marketing the Cody for or illegal activities\n[noise] well this is what I'm trying to cut through because I've done a little bit of online research about it and it's difficult because you get such a disparate opinions some people say it's legal if the best thing since sliced bread et cetera et cetera\nOthers say you know buyer user being aware and I'm having a hard time sort of figuring out what the truth about it is\nLet me give you the straight story okay right what's different than Cody versus something like the Roku is are you familiar with Roku are okay you\nOh sure yeah All right so Roku controls what programming can grow on its device and so they make sure that people are copyright compliant bit the programming that's going on it is legal\nIn Cody media player on the other hand is like truly an open source kind of thing so Cody itself is not doing anything illegal at all but it provides a platform where the pirate stealing content\nCan put their content and sell you access to it that operates through the Cody media player a\nSo there's lots of legal content you can watch on Cody it's the same kinds of stuff you legally can watch on a Roku or other competitors of Roku and so the difference is Roku is not going to allow\nSomebody who is pirating\nEvery uh let's say soccer game from Europe\nFor free or NFL football or NBA basketball or the latest episodes of some HBO show that you're able to stream supposedly for free\nThrough Cody they're not they're not saying free you pay 'em like thirty dollars or fifty dollars and it gives you this license supposedly you're able to watch all that content\n... thirty to fifty if the price point for the mystic is that what you're referring\nNo I'm Talking about when somebody says hey we're going to provide you\nAll the programming from blah blah blah and so that then you access through the Cody media player Cody itself is just a platform mhm but it is a gateway for the crux the pirates\nTo sell people\nProgramming that you are not legally supposed to have\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI'm any big scare me good vampires where ... children\nOne bit but you know it does scare me downtime inefficiency scares the living daylights out of me that's why use Granger

be an investigation of that\nBut here's one of the greatest weirdness as I can think of\nFrontier airlines one of the deep discount airlines has reduced its fee for changing cancellation and in fact if you book a ticket way ahead in you decide three months or more out that you're not going to go they charge you know the at all and give your money back\nSo\nIt's so weird that the three full

old you are to Delhi take our ally slipping eat until over advertised circular onto my driveway at least once a week I feel like I ...\nI wearing about cutting Aloul calls I'm not against the other day when I'm Out of town and we traveled frequently\nWayne advertise a little circular how when I'm Out of town on the war I think now for the war when he called I called ... circulation the heartland of the paper and the number lifted\nAnd they wrong anyhow anything will they ... they said they\nOnly a lie and they just get on your phone ... the data white with newspapers so many people no longer get a daily newspaper that a lot of newspapers are doing this week clear twice weekly delivery of sales fires\nAnd they may have an outer package that has like a news article or two in it and that's it and there's really just an excuse to have all the flyers delivered to you\nAnd you're a non customer they're throwing these typically only to the driveways are people who don't subscribe to the paper and I don't even know if they have an address system\nTo prevent dropping it at your address in by the way you are I think over the years you're the third or fourth person who's called me complaining about this\nStudy I feel like it's kind of a litter or that man or something like that now\nI don't think so now let me tell you what I Do I'm like my own unofficial neighborhood watch champion and as I walked through the neighborhood\nWhenever I see let's say somebody gets a Sunday paper and there are way you know you can tell their what they didn't get their paper and it's like noon or I see one of those advertising supplements thrown\nWhatever it is I hide those things that go put it behind a Bush ... or whatever that as well\nSo what I Would say is that you need to have some kind of buddy system with a neighbor that you look out for them they look out for you because even if you get that circular stop by some miracle for awhile\nTurnover is going to happen somebody else is going to be throwing them and you're going to get one\nSo I it's gonna have to be something where neighbors work together to prevent that because it's such an easy mark for a burglar last weekend a neighbor had for newspapers there subscriber they afford newspapers sitting\nAnd you know they were already starting to turn yellow a couple of them I mean that's a into a bird or come on and we're going to have added\nThings for ... yeah well I I appreciate that clock in our story I backing up data you know not only do I got my dad at my computer every day I got my backup every three

smaller drive that checking my safety deposit box well never mind if I go get it out and got my God\nYou are you are brilliant that is so smart because it gives you the control you know the worst that happens with what you're doing is if your computer gets ransom it just becomes a brick and you get a new computer if you have to\nPay ... a a fighter path\nYour data is safe I laugh you know what else you said that is important about data backup ... now you can get the ones that do it automatically every day or every night yeah\nYeah so you don't pay that something you have to remember to do it's done for you and so appreciate you bringing that up and your idea of the backup for the backup\nThat's more than I Do and it's a great idea\nThan is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Dan\nHi clerk Dan how may I serve you\nWell I have a question about my daughter is traveling to Italy on a school trip and\nHow lucky is she she got ... the fine you got to pay for it you stay home that doesn't sound like a deal to me\nIt doesn't sound fair ... so her question is how ... what is the best way to bring\nSpending money to Italy is because she is kind of shy away from using a debit card because of um identity theft issues\nHow old is your daughter she's twenty okay does she have any major credit card yet\nNo not yet she's tried to get a store credit card but she doesn't make enough money according to them to qualify for a credit card\nSo what I Would recommend in this case she very responsible is the person she is\nAll right is what I Would recommend that you with your cards see which of your credit cards does not charge of foreign currency transaction junk the yup and do you know if any of yours are the free for foreign travel\nI'm not sure no I'd have to look into\nThe how many cars do you have I have to any chance one of them are capital one\nOne is the capital\nOne my odds that you would say yes capital one was the pioneer in issuing cars that don't charge foreign currency junk fees\nYep just make sure that the capital one card you have doesn't charge those chunk phase okay and then get her and authorized user card you can get that like just a few days\nAnd she travels with that and with the beauty of that is that she can use it all across Italy\nAnd she will be able to purchase things at what's known as bankers buying rate which is the actual real rate of transaction that we'd go on between the U.S dollar and the euro\nOkay now as far as ATMs\nDo she have a a a credit union account or bank account or whatever\nYes a bank account regular savings account a checking account at a federal savings bank\nOh and then the federal savings bank you don't hear about those much anymore now so to a federal savings bank those are those are kind of like almost like claws I credit unions\nSo they may not charge a big fee for her using an ATM card to withdraw euros she needs them in Italy\nOkay yeah she was going to check into her back to see if what the fees were\nSo normally that's the best combination that you have a major credit card that charges no foreign currency junk fees\nAnd you have an ATM card that doesn't hit you up with a bunch of junk fees at an ATM give you a comparison most of the big banks charge a ten dollar per transaction fee when you withdraw money at an ATM outside the United states\nWow that's a lot it is huge and so a lot of credit unions a usa as an example of a bank that doesn't charge a fee when you use the ATM overseas oh in Charles Schwab stock brokerage she have any investments or do you have any investments for her\nNo no we don't\nOkay for them for other people I mentioned Charles Schwab has a ATM card that allows unlimited withdrawals fee free in the United states and overseas\nIt's a great product for

information and they are\n[noise] joins us on the Clark Howard show Chris you want to talk about finishing college that's what I'm I'm I'm thinking about how far along are you on your journey\nAccounting program air I've gotten all the business classes all the accounting classes and all I have left are probably about twelve or so credit so\nYou know the standard math and English type of stuff that I've been taking no one to two classes per semester I took a break the last two semesters and they actually ended up paying off a little bit of student loan that I have learned those lessons\nSo you're working full time and squeezing out around that picking up courses to get ... is this going to be a bachelor's you're getting an accounting\nWell actually it started with it if it's a lovely transferred\nVery good All right that's great how can I be of service cars you picked a great field\nA well you know I'm working full time work six days a week or during the summer when we were almost sixty hours per week and um I work at a motorcycle shop that I still enjoy what I Do but uh there's not a whole lot of room for advancement sure a a ... and ... in a job\nSo I'm kind of see I'm thirty eight years old and\nI'm Wondering if uh should choose which my major to something a little more practical for the technical uh possibly\nWell I mean accounting is a great field for you to transition into\nBecause you you're talking about getting an associates an accounting right yes that's a that's a wonderful field I I wouldn't switch gears on that okay if you finish the associates and so you said your twelve credit hours away so he\nIs each course three credit hours that how the math works so you have for her to go away so you get the form or courses done and are you then going to take that accounting degree and go get a job in that leaves the motorcycle shop is that\nThe that that is what I'm planning on a um I think that's a perfect\nYeah I'm just not sure what jobs are available as far as the accounting\nWould I Would do is I Would call one of the owners of a local CPA from okay yeah I thought about that\nAnd go sit down with the owners they're always looking for people to work doing accounting or various levels of bookkeeping and to go in and talk to one for advice is the first path to you and finding a place that may ultimately employee you\nConsider doing that I didn't know if that was yeah\nCome on ... on the hundred percent\nBecause people love being asked for advice they generally don't like being asked for a job there so I think that what you've worked so hard to achieve\nComplete get bad accounting degree get into that as a field and then see if you if you want to then go on while you're doing that and get a bachelor's in accounting go ahead if you decide after a while why did I think this is what I wanted to do then\nMaybe you take your career path a different way but I think he picked a great field it takes a special person to work sixty hours a week and go to school you are that person you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] not to [laughter] [noise]\n\nHow much of the credit you have as a ... percent you're using currently directly translates into several hundred points of your credit score\nIf I wanted to be exact\nIt's nearly three hundred points\nAnd so that wasn't exactly I Would stay close the product evasion [laughter] but you get the idea so when you are applying for a mortgage there's going to sound weird\nBut you're what's does your utilization of credit cards in order to get the very best interest rate on a mortgage needs to be below ten percent that means and simple math view of ten thousand dollars available credit on credit cards\nYou want to charge on them in a month less than one thousand dollars or manipulate the score\nBy sending in payments to your credit card company before your billing cycle closes so that you're essentially pre paying that much balance before it would generate\nAnd that can move your score big time\nOr the other huge chunk of what makes up your credit score is paying your bills on time every month and\nIf you have had a problem with that that's not easily heal that one take some ... significant time but if you are\nGoing for a home and mortgage\nAt least four months out I Need you to get copies of all three of your credit report and you do that an annual credit report dot com completely free\nAnd look for any note pays or late pays but particularly no pace and unpaid balance most of the time it'll be for some medical thing you didn't even know your money on and you want to take care of those\nBecause that is an important factor in underwriting\nBut remember the most important factor\nIn terms of getting a quick jump on that score stop using your credit cards Jennifer joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello Jennifer\nHi Gail\nI'm doing great thank you and you have a weekly mortgage\nWhy pay for it by a week or\nSo tell me or you just starting a mortgage are you in it and they're offering you a bi weekly\nI laugh at it and I said I don't why they are as I thought if I if I wait go that route I offered me a call ... housing [laughter]\nOkay so what are they gonna charge you to go from paying your mortgage monthly they're paying a bi weekly\nFat for for for free really\nThat's what I don't I don't find it out at seven in fact I'm like\nWell that is a great question and there are a number of programs\nWhere you can pay your mortgage bi weekly but it is not it it's not really doing what you think because they do just what you said you pay the money to them half a monthly mortgage\nIn every other week and then by the end of the year you've made the equivalent of one extra payments since there's\nFifty two weeks in a year you've made twenty six half payments are Thirteen full payments and I am looking\nAt the website of its Quicken Loans is who you're mortgages with All right and they say free and sample other companies charge a fee and they say it's completely free with no extra fees and when you make the payment\nThey're explaining it gosh exactly like I Do that you've made an additional payment\nAnd they talk about the set up and all that it's the first time I've ever seen one\nThat allows you to do this once you have alone in place completely free but it does not say and the explanation\nIf they are just holding your money for that whole year and then making the one additional payment for you at the end of the year so you're right to ask that question but I'm stunned because I don't recall anybody ever offering this as a freebie\nOkay okay\nYeah I mean if you if you if it works for you to get paid every other week\nNow\nOh well that works the same yeah so if you want to do this in ... years off you're alone and they're not going to charge you anything for it I think it's great\nBrian is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian cyclic REO great thank you Brian you did a good job you save money at your own job I tried to well that's great how can I be of help with that well\nI just recently started a new job and the previous employer and this current on both as four O. one K. matches or they're managed by different companies and I'm Wondering what to do with my old four oh one K.\nAnd how much did you have in that old four one K.\nShift a little bit less than Seventy three thousand\nOkay that's great that's great can it can I ask how old you are Brian I'm forty six okay so you know you want that piled or grow and grow and grow so they can have\nA point that you can retire and comfort in that retirement and building up that four one K. money is great your new employer the match they have how do they do that one\nUh it's just a direct eight percent that they put in\nNo way so you put in money and they'll pop in another eight percent\nI don't have to put in any I Do but they they will put in eight percent\nWow I'm In the wrong business or whatever business you're in that area generous you know yes that is so\nThe the question on the old plan since the amount of money you have in it it is completely your choice\nIf you will have the money there or you move it to the new employer and the way I decide is it the old employer plan is a one of the ultra low cost four one K. plans I Would leave the money behind on the other hand if you're a new employer has an ultra low cost four one K. plan\nIt would make a lot of sense to move the money and if both plans are kind of\nEqual and cost then you could either move the money to the new plan or put it in your own IRA that do you okay you have any information on the kind of cost structure that you have with either the plans\nI Do not I don't know that\nSo that would be key for you and making a decision because over time over the next Twenty years till you hit the key to retire you know mid forties when most people were just hire mid sixties the costs and the plan\nHave a massive effect on how much money you actually end up with it the end of the day okay so the the lowest cost plans in America are offered by one company and that's banned guard and so if\nEither of your plans or vanguard then you'd want to operate based on the fact is the vanguard plan if you're old plan was vanguard plan leave the money behind if you're a new plan is vanguard plan than you'd want to move the old employer money\nFrom the old employer into the new employer vanguard plant if it's not vanguard then you've got to go a step further and dig in\nAnd see what the costs actually are and just for frame of reference\nHow many people work for the company you're working for now\nFor a fortune five hundred company\nSo okay so the costs on the plan all and should be less than one half of one percent\n[noise] okay and it is managed by bang my new company is so\nThen if it is a vanguard plan move the money from the old plan roll it over into the new company plant\nOkay and ... and since it's a vanguard plan you don't even have to worry what the expenses are going to be because I'll tell you they're going to be ...\nOkay I had to experience recently Brian I was at a gate for an airplane that was delayed in one of the airline employees came up to me to ask me a question about four one K. so that delay of the flight\nGave the time for the airline unemployed asked me about the plan and I had him pull it up on the computer and this huge airline is giving its employees are terrible four O. one K. plan terrible with very high costs\nAnd the only thing I could figure is maybe the airline does a lot of it's hum\nA debt placements and a stock issue in since and buybacks and all that through that same companies so they feel like they have to throw their four one Kay

wars the distinguished journalist you also mentioned you'd done an interview with George Will the conservative comes as well\nCan you give us a hint about what George Will have to say other than that I'm leaving the Republican Party because it's not a Republican Party anymore to Trump party and there's nothing to do with conservatives it has to do with or talk Racine oligarchy that's not Republican that's not the Republican Party I knew and then I joined so I'm leaving did he mentioned that you mentioned that\nYou mentioned that you mentioned she just reasons for re known seems that the longstanding loyalty he explained to express way he had become a kind of libertarian\n... he's incredibly thoughtful men one thing that I can start with Bill is how eloquent he's English is he's he's sentences how beautifully crafted they are\nHow a consistent he is in shaping within seven hundred and fifty words at a very developed argument at a time when many op ed pieces seemed to be simply partisan and poorly delivered he's amend that really works\nYes George Will I thought wrote a very powerful piece recently in which he came out in opposition to the death penalty and that was movement on his part but he said let's be real the death penalty doesn't work it's racist it's expensive to ... it doesn't protect public safety\nBased on the evidence we have to say that America should abolish the death penalty I thought that was pretty courageous for\nHe's a he's a public intellectual really of of the ...\nThe fiber is when he talks in the interview and the episode of the country about how he had developed these fought over time is how he has moved on certain positions he's for instance still very much a\nA non believer on climate change in the white tested him in that direction he would not the budge but another\nHe is very clear and he he's very critical of the current the nice thing\nOf Republicans to Donald Trump in the he believes you know I asked him in ... if the\nAds in the act of writing columns from the conservative perspective as he does\nIs dying in he's he keeps it beautiful response to that he says\nYou know we're at a time when people read the less and less people read less and less newspapers people read less and less the opinion page of newspaper so\nJust the thought that he would spent his entire life writing on the page that hardly anybody really read except for those that are passionate\nIn those that are also if he says in those that are fifty an older and have time for that is is is a dying breed he's he's I you know I have very different opinions that he is but I admire the way he presents them\nIn my book a new book was on the car plant in a piece called don't trust calmness which I've reworked a number of times and talks

around that but the first thing we did before we even talked about what we would do together we just start having lunch together and we had several inches once a week for a couple of months just to
