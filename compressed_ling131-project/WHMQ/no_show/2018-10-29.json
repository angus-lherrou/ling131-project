I was going through a commission you ... coral for like fish tank simply yeah uh-huh that's like right yeah um and then we got to accept that we uh we got a certificate fun to see see see\nSo that's usually the first step but somebody wants to get well\nMost people who got the certificate where people who are worried disproportionate it by the federal and state laws that\nWere knocked them back in the days and I'm a lot of the people got\nArrested I got in trouble or they'll be living in Holyoke for you know more than ten years\nUh-huh okay so how does that certificate hope you and your business\nA death certificate what he does is that if both of our um obligation running for everybody else uh-huh so let's say you have an obligation and the company and you apply and um today and we apply next month they'll put us in front of the life\nSo it's sort of a combination of affirmative action and like an enterprise zones correct yeah okay so okay so you have met certificate and then there's several other certificates and licenses you need\nYes um there is a wandering ones that difficulty that were given in a in a believe they buy if I'm correct dishonor wants it to figure that were given by the CDC in different towns there's various of the state of Massachusetts\nBelieve they buy if I'm correct is honoring wants it to forget that were given by the CDC and different towns different areas of the state of Massachusetts and I'm white and now we have to do is find funding and then submitted a um community hosts agreement mhm in the city Holyoke\nAnd after that then we have to go to the city and you know once are no obligation and process is approved by the city that was submitted right so they can out of control\nAnd and approved by the city or correct me if I'm wrong but it's something like that that gives you something that says they don't object that is correct uh-huh so that's their approval was later in the ... that\nAre jak there were wants to see the plan so how do the ... of the uh excess kind of as a product of all\nAs soon as all the industrial requirement that struggle because it is a factory yes it is yeah so um what got you interested in joining the cannabis a market it's such a an intense competition right now when nobody knows where it's going to end up well\nWhat got me interested as a let's put it this way I I used to grow corals to make money so I can restore the reef ... ah and I couldn't\nMake a lot of money on growing corals meant people are not breaking the ... that is correct that is correct but um I Want it to be able to restore the relief I did it on ... cautions Rico and I you know planted some corals and the locations of where I grew up in like I'm a Puerto Rico uh-huh\nBeen there and the beautiful place yeah and um I decided I ... I wanted to kind of is it gives us a lot more revenue and I can help the disproportionate impact that community of Holyoke by moving jobs and taking some of that funds and helping the community\nSo you you chose candidates but your purpose is to do good in society\nAll I've slowly that ... the main goal yeah I Want to be able to help uh programs like the spark program Holyoke which I Am a graduate from uh-huh and um\nWith this business yeah you took the idea through spark a like an incubator that is right and that is correct on the canvas for laws\nI learned a lot as far as how to manage a business out of the you know just the whole forward and go for it and has to say what you want right and then um I Want to be able to help that a type of programs in the city Holyoke\nUm because they help or minorities you achieve businesses yeah basically they are in power and power in the community in the city the minority community of right\nRight so what business lessons did you get if I may may repeat what you said that you're not only grew coral but you have grown cannabis in your life yes not not in the free market a of today's legal cannabis but what business lessons are you taking out of that cannabis growing\nPeople who use kind of as you see it in the middle of the aggressive ah so ah I don't think we're going to go down to ... I think they usually lose the alcoholics though\nOr in fights well that's true yeah but then again ... ... you know I mean I you know they become dangerous my driving you could kill somebody of viewing ... I haven't seen that person was a impair with cameras and\nYou know driving down the road swing left and right and so I I don't think we're going to the other two I think we already went down to two but alcohol\n[laughter] okay so let's get back to you were describing you're describing how you're going to be in greenhouses on what is now open land somewhere a secret location\nAre you worried about crime because even though it might be much more affordable and legal or how are you going to prevent people breaking in instilling all your cannabis plant\nWell we have a place of security plan already and a security plan includes a two fences ... won a fence a sixteen foot a feat\nIndex cheerio widow mouth in between so I'm not into saying yes\nNo water and ... or ... or ... of a sudden somebody try you know that the climate these days people break it into a you know places with the car and drive and everything they can we intend to prevent that in the ... that's right yeah and uh we intend to have a security officer which we have a police officer retired from Holyoke uh-huh\nUh which is a great men\nAnd um he was going to manage our security yeah so we're going to have cameras um to secure their el times connected to the police department in case they see something wrong they will have access to a facility\nSo I Know in the world of medical marijuana or you know the kind of divided up into the uh sit TiVo which is more stimulating and then the indigo which is more as my sister cause him to couch yes\nThe uh sit TiVo which is more stimulating and then the IndyCar which is more as\nMy sister goes into couch yet a relaxing and then this hybrids and some have medicinal you take this for insomnia you take this very irritable bowel syndrome as recreational going to have all of those distinctions are just there's going to be more about getting Hi\nUh this will be all of those distinctions ... I'm a crowd of marijuana grower will take prior to have it all those distinctions on his products and that's why we intend to do intend to grow up to eleven different strains and we have three different strains that we have a diehard selves\nAnd what we want to do is are we going to take those strange when you buy the product is going to have a level of steady in how much you know ... see a much yeah CBD and everything that was what is good for and what can do it\nBut of course you're gonna have to go by the specifications of whoever you're supplying like around here um there's a lot of people that grow like barley and Ronnie and things that go into liquor or beer and if\nThey are lucky enough to sell to Sam Adam Sam adams says this is exactly\nWhat you need to grow you following the quality standards of your supplier of your customers\nYes I'm just so you know we're not going to have just any regular greenhouse uh-huh agree houses are worth a million and a half dollars these are a couple of line greenhouses which is basically\nTemperature control in control and so we're going to go to the whole month growing all twelve months ago one of the year and we're going to have a crop basically every year that way and yeah the three green houses on the other night every year every month we're going to have a crop right oh we're going to have three houses have rotated crop every day\nSo just to change the topic a little bit so now you said you're looking for basically investors you look at it or people who were going to want to return on investment and want to know what your timeline is and all the things that would go into them investing in you or Walmart or Arab defense or anything\nSo right now right now will Elsie so we're looking for partners shit we want to find people who now they just have the money but they can contribute to the company and be involved in the company\nAh we're looking for a local people because I Believe that in Massachusetts this this has been around for people in Massachusetts you know what I mean you got all this other companies coming in from Colorado California and then there's not a lot of people from Massachusetts taken advantage of this\nI knew a company in Holyoke years ago that well they were going to move out of Holyoke and then the past mayor and past economic development director basically said if you stay in you hire X percent of all your people will give you these tax breaks are you going after anything like that\nAll yes online so every all puts them in a fine we're gonna hire mostly people from ... ... ... and our business partners to I'm going to have the opportunity to work in the business but we were on\nA train them in the industry\nOpposite literally trying every body into but everybody has to go to a rigorous training to me that we have ... quality offensive\nSo are there now industry specifications or certificates for somebody who is a good\nPot farmer yes there is a program who is being developed a HCC who do this on a train you know the youth who wants to work and kind of is that we tend to us you know work with them all\nYeah flight up yeah and even I saw that a a major law firm that everyone promote because they didn't pay the station or anything for that in Springfield is now opening a special cannabis law division so it really is getting official\nI her son did end up but I never know Doug yeah I'll\nSay later my information yet yeah so what about the idea of it still federally against the law and you can't really have a bank account with your money is\nWell I did find a solution for that there is a bank is called a federal credit union who is looking to I'm a ... kind of his money you have to go to the very rigorous process to prove where the money's coming from that's why you have to have\nTo pass it to them on the street or actually to tell her a ... for that question I'm kidding so so um you know like a drug passing no not a not an okay I'm just kidding so yes so that's so the banking problem at least this coming up with some creative solutions and that is right\nThat is right as a program called safe harbor full yeah ... ... yeah\nAnybody out there and check it out so you know nobody really knows how this was going to happen you can't compare to uh Amsterdam or something like that this is the United states in each state has a different culture I heard years ago a couple of years ago that the price is going to drop so much that it's going to be given away for free and sugar packets in restaurants\nI heard that too but I Do believe that the regulations I mean that could be a stop 'em and that's the idea of me growing them three houses because I have a cheaper products income paid with the big companies ...\nSo if you have a cheaper products with your pitch to a customer be you can buy it for less than sell it for the same or that you can undercut them on the retail level\nNo we're not going to do anything it that way I was saying we want to do a wholesale uh-huh okay let's say a manufacturing yeah buy from us yeah things were going out or the price of the kind of a door I mean we're going to do outdoor or indoor and greenhouses right\nUm the indoors more expensive to drill you have better quality yes I use the F ... less overhead yeah right exactly and then on the green houses\nYou have less overhead mhm and then you have a less you know perfect product and now to make perfect 'cause it can be perfect if you know what you're doing but I mean the price is going on here with us a little bit yeah so then say you could be able to buy a matter of fact chicken products that are far Canada and then you can sell that yeah the market\nAnd then I Know this is like an odd example but once I knew was still know strawberry grow around here\nThere was saying big why will take everything I can grow of organic strawberries but they want a mass quantity fifty two weeks a year and since I can provide that they don't want to buy from me so how do you get that quality and quantity up to the point that you can be a regular supplier\nBy hiring the best ... alright and use in um certain products we let them grow organic mhm right which is going to be big a lot of companies are using all kinds of federal lives as we want to use all natural organic product\nUm we do have a few uh interests are already on a company who wants to buy all of our product is around ... on that yes they they want to because there why is it a more local or one of the you know the level you know as local we want to work with all the local people so we can help them too\nYeah but we also a way of looking to we have tried to look to work with some of the big companies that we haven't got her\nYeah so do you think that there's going to be a an attraction to local inorganic in this industry like there is with everything else\nAbsolutely because a local and organic me you're not putting all this uh chemicals into you know I'm not a license right of the kind of even though the kind of a soft developed a very rigorous testing you know show you don't have the heavy metal pesticides fund the size and all that stuff\nSo that's why we have our on our plan was going to grow and the greenhouse and it's going to be completely\n... so\nSo Gerardo just in the time remaining how does somebody who's listening to the show\nIt's going to be completely\nOut of this going to be great so so drawn to just in the time remaining how does somebody who's listening to the show get involved with your company\nOh yes they can um go through our website W. W. W. dot Holyoke green drawers dot com or Greg with yes you have to [laughter] and all they can email or email us at a Mary J uh-huh I totally agree Mars dot com oh you called me up for one three ... three Ninety six okay let's\nAnswer and it's supposed to do good old Mary J even though which now has all these other fancy names that's right yeah that's great well I Wish you all the best and um that you come back in five years and talk about how you're buying up all the Colorado companies in Massachusetts\nI probably gonna go ahead and buy property in Holyoke and fix it and just see the looks like to see the greater good I Love Holyoke so Mitchell best of luck to you in that city okay great you bring this is the western mass business show if you own a business in western mass in your story to tell\nEverybody I don't care what your political ideology is this is just not the way it should be and he has a responsibility\nTo ... any president has a responsibility to try to unite this country I mean in the aftermath of this you know I Would have expected you know not sarcasm as his um at this rally last night and they would have expected not treat blaming the press this morning I would've expected something to rise and you get your samples that we we we all got to take a\nStep backwards at back back here and we have to figure out a way to move forward as one country uh but I think he's capable of doing that um and uh and it's really sad and you know it's a dangerous time maybe these people you know many\nOf them are my dear friends you know potentially could have been killed ah and um and I just I find that very frightening\nWhen you are in the middle of a a race right now for the second congressional district and I'm In the campaign ads that I'm seeing from your Republican challenger Tracy Laverne she's saying that um the rhetoric that you give leads into this is a defensive and it's always anti Trump\nIs does the last bear any responsibility in regards to the tone that the country is experiencing and being subjected to I guess currently\nWell look at I mean I have always tried to be a voice of trying to bring people together um but that doesn't mean that when somebody gets up and says something that is racist you know that is a degrading to women or that uh you know or or racist policies where\nFamilies are separated from their parents at the border but doesn't mean you sit back and say nothing\nLook I I have very strong disagreements with this president but I also come from a ... tradition where I've seen Democrats or Republicans work together you know I my first job on Capitol Hill and I was in college it's with George McGovern the big liberal from South Dakota his best friend with Barry Goldwater\nOr a ... a conservative Republican from Arizona and I used to ask like what's this but government Goldwater friendship all about and he used to say look it varies a nice guy I disagree with him [laughter]\nI mean he wants to increase military budget I Want to decrease military budget but you know what you don't have to agree and everything to agree on something and the ... got to come together we got to move forward\nBut just because I disagree with him on major issues doesn't mean he's my enemy um and I think what this president has done is he's personalized every stick to the point where if you disagree with them\nThen you are his enemy um and um and I think that this rhetoric that he has a put forward a you know has been incredibly destructive to our politics and that's and that is why you know I mean I I I think people I don't care what your politics or\nYou need to send a message on election day all across this country that this is unacceptable that we are better this is not who we are because if things stay the same reason that may maybe that is who we are and that is really frightening a spot for me to even contemplate\nOn the election this question comes from Matt lonely or he says the numerous high ranking officials like Scott Pruitt that have resigned under a cloud of scandal the two recent corruption indictments of Republican congressmen and California and New York the party's nomination of unknown child molester in Alabama is this the time that Democrats will be marching out there with a message\nOf not necessarily decrying Trump specifically but I'm a moral high ground and the Democrats the left has a moral high ground at this point\nI think I think we do I mean I you know and one of the things that I had been a stress thing on the campaign trail is that there are a lot of issues on the ballot in November six but one of them that is\nOh and one of the things that I had been a stress thing on the campaign trail is that there are a lot of issues on the ballot in November six but one of them that is incredibly important is decency um and that you know if if you want to bring dishes you back to our politics are then you should vote for the Democrats\nBecause it's clear that are the Republicans in Congress or don't have the wherewithal of it got so the courage to stand up to some of the things is president saying um they can't condemn his sexism racism um you know or his policies\nThat are that like separating children of their parents are at their border I think they're afraid to do show and and look at if you're quiet during these times I think you're complicit ... I think we I think we I think we have an opportunity if we are fortunate enough to take control of Congress\nTo establish a a different set of rules um you know where we where we actually I'm a ... you know are competing\nTo all kinds of views including those we disagree with and hopefully critic climate where people can actually get back to you know the ... you know Tip O'Neill and Ronald\nReagan when you know there were disagreements but\nYou know we were able to move forward in the civil in a civil way but it you know which brings us to this moment that we're in right now I I I just was all that just happened um it is I'm kind of unbelievable to me\nThat uh the White House couldn't you know rallied the I don't know that whatever it takes to get up and just said that this is so terribly wrong and that you know this is a difficult moment in our country and we need to find ways to come together\nYou know rather than the president tweeting this morning that it's all you know it's all depressed his faults um I I just feel like he's capable of bringing people together\nWell you and I congressman governor do our best to bring some people together on November of Nineteen twenties let up several months away we had a meeting at your office last week with the food bank um several of the marchers ... at the food bank and did a volunteer effort\nOr last night's and sorting of potatoes where over six hundred families will have access to potatoes thanks to the little bit of labor that we put in there uh yesterday so not too late to feel like you can get involved and do something good intangible here in our community and hopefully take a step toward\nActually ending hunger or written large as opposed to just alleviating hunger on a day to day basis so why\nBut I'm I'm looking forward to this and the\nAnd one of the reasons why I look forward to monkeys march every year it's not because I like to walk which is forty three mile yeah but I look forward to it because I think it represents the goodness of our community people come together and um and and you know and contributed to help alleviate hunger in our community and I think that's just that's what communities are supposed to do\nA and um and so I I'm really proud to be proud of it and again anybody you know who uh you know if you don't have to match the whole forty three miles much right you could come for a mile or half a mile or whatever\nYou can virtually ... yup every little bit and you can find all the details through our website W.

legislature of Massachusetts\nHe is going into his fourth term not completing his third and prior to being a representative from Holyoke with the representative from Holyoke his city councilor in the city of and for the city of Holyoke for some for years\nI'd like to talk to you about two different topics today representative Vegas one is I Want to talk to you about politics both state and local and I'd like to talk about some of the substance of work that the legislature did not complete\nAt last term and I'd like to know a session and I'd like to know what you think will happen with those really pressing issues beginning this next session but let's start with politics and we were talking yesterday about the governor's race\nAnd I said and after I said I said this is kind of right so the J Gonzales the Democratic nominee for governor is actually would actually make a really good governor he's very experienced is very level headed he's got good policy smarty understands\nThe inter connectedness of governmental agencies and policies and budgets but I think he's not a very good candidate and therefore the odds of him actually an seeding\nGovernor Charlie breakers seem really remote at this point at this point and I would appreciate your perspective as a long time and lifelong Democrat [laughter]\nWell good morning good to be here um yeah I think it's always something that we talk about um whenever people collect means that they want to run for office I was there was two jobs are actually going for ones being the candidate and one's actually be a legislator and they're very different\nUm and unfortunately especially in this world now I mean if you're going to be in campaign mode as a kid but you got inspired people you've got to speak well you've got to look at the ... you've got to do all this other stuff that doesn't necessarily relate to the actual job\nAnd you're right I think Jay I mean he was in a secretary has been in health care and the ministry of finance ministers from finance underdeveloped veteran Duvall Patrick where he did a great job did a great job so you understand the budget I went to see the more talking about the budget I mean he has some great ideas like you're right off the policies\nI Would like to see more substantial way as well how we're gonna pay for stuff I'm One of his plan so I think he's great I met him many times are we sat down many times\nBut um I think given that you have some struggles with the campaign I also think the state party hasn't stepped up I'm outside democratic parties having stepped into going to help out because Charlie makers got Seventy two percent of ... and so it was a little bit worn right\nAnd people look at that and potential donors look at that and say why am I going to spend money on a campaign that has very little chance of being successful and of course though fewer dollars that come into a campaign right it's a little bit like a that a water going down the drain which is\nThe more people with fewer people support the campaign that fewer people will support the campaign money is the mother's milk or politics one without it it's really hard to have a chance well\nMessage was paid for by the Massachusetts stem advisory council\nThis message was paid for by the Massachusetts ...\nPie crust\nPizza there hasn't been sitting under heat lamps for the last six hours\nThere's always a house I Want to place to take a team when we were in the championship in a place to take the teams around their sorrows and Marron Erin [noise]\nThere's always a burden on a ... big enough to be twelve people to go\nI Want to chop chop down I Want to eat inside [noise]\nThere's always remember does hurt us in North Hampton institution there's always referred\nTo in most parts of the country you'd be hard pressed to find more than one call up to do business with here in the valley tens of thousands of people do business with cops everyday food collapsed credit unions solar installers farm suppliers copy shops in more locally owned and controlled creating jobs and building our local economy\nOur family farm smelled bashed local cooperative and going strong since Nineteen Ninety five and local melt failed strong bones and found that kind of neat [noise]\nBeing a student read something to a class students that has completely shut down\nTo see that same student a year later standing in front of the whole room full of kids in reading something is like the best we get to see the whole little steps turned into a huge victory I mean really spend a lot of time making sure that every kid find success it's not that the child is looking successful but he's actually being\nPulled charging as an organization that I'll faint extracurricular enrichment any factional came out any\nI mean we have kids with autism and get it Down syndrome and kids with no diagnosis we've seen students they succeed in a classroom setting we haven't been in a classroom with tears for years the author kids who are typical benefit because they leave the classes like a larger view of abilities that these these kids who are we ... didn't notice as much before I have so much to offer\nAnd then they appeared and if and he didn't even want to hear any child yeah then if that were going to take on second thought children is Henri ... whole children's\nDot org [noise] this is the best of bill Newman\nWHM the news in\n[noise] the only way that we can we continue our conversation with state representative in Vegas from Holyoke during the break you and I were talking about represented we were talking about how Charlie Baker\nHas managed to keep his image and foster this image of a traditional Republican the fiscally conservative a but still socially a liberal\nRepublican as a kind of ... Jacob Javits of years ago\nUm ... the sultan stalls perhaps\nBut a lot of that is not because Charlie Baker is so traditionally Republican but because as you pointed out while we were talking during their break he's managed to foster this image of having a distance from Donald Trump which is paying enormous dividends for him politically you explain that a bit force\nWhile I think what he's able to do like you said it's just it's just sort of come out and say you know I mean I'm In favor of marriage equality I'm In favor of ... between writes I have people in my family so again connecting to voters\nAnd call out you know what President Trump has been doing 'em and counted out\nAs not part of his party in Colorado's extreme or Colorado something he doesn't agree with and said he wasn't going to vote for him and stuff like that of course this was back firing a little bit now if you voted down the ticket voting for Bill\nWho's a Trump million and if you will running against it was only going to war and so that's getting him a little bit hot water but he's again he's trying to come back to yeah I'm a traditional Republican uh\nAnd I'll support the Trump peace to a candidate for Senate if I have to but then I'm going to walk back so you kind of no I don't really believe that raunchy ... exactly so you know but then this time right now where\nI mean the Republican Party is ... you know split I mean even in Massachusetts right Scott Lively still give twenty percent of the boats and the Republican primary voters in primary right I mean in in ... in the far right ... famous mostly famous for his supporters they kill the gays bill Uganda in the ground is so\nSo if you did was different from if you thought he was able so Baker there was I think that the extreme party I'm not that guy\nI Know I Want to get things done and he uses a lot of send messages that come out of the legislature like from speaking to Leo of hey we're not D.C we get things done by positively right it might be only thirty three Republicans in a hundred and twenty seven Democrats but let me get twenty their votes we can say is bipartisan there's like five or seven\nRepublicans in the Senate but if you get for their votes it's only bipartisan so he's able to say as his leadership to say we're not Washington we get things done and we do a bipartisan way\nWell let's talk about some of that bipartisanship in the legislature and specifically whether or not the legislature is going to get things done\nBecause at the end of the last session there were major pieces of legislation that did not move major policy questions before the legislature that have not been resolved and I like to address at least two of them if we learned today\nThat one has healthcare because healthcare now takes ... a forty to forty four percent of the Massachusetts state budget and coming to grips with health care costs in coverage is\nEnormously important issue this was an issue that representative coke was devoted to trying to solve and of course his death and as it was is is not only sad for so many reasons but includes the one that\nWe've lost his expertise on health care if they go and so what's going to happen with health care and the legislature this next session\nWell what has to happen something has to have I mean so it is it continues to be a priority or there's already been statements of leadership saying the health care will be a prayer for next session\nBut I think the thing is is that again with two hundred ... elected to hundred and sixty wraps him for his senators\nGetting consensus a special on health care is not the easiest thing especially in my opinion when you put together is on the bus bills to have so much in it I mean the Senate bill basically wanted to rewrite healthcare again I'm not saying it's good or bad but that's basically what it was doing that so much in their\nHouse or whatever rewriting of his Romneycare revising Rodney care if you will exactly and of course the house version as it's always the case was much more conservative and smaller and scope um but also the issue is that we've dealt with some of the big issues in a totally different way\nThe one issue for me on the health care is priced variants I mean that's that is what price variants what's that the fact that private insurers\nWhen they create a contract with Boston medical and they will then pay twenty two thousand dollars for a hip replacement\nAnd then when they finally come over to her medical center and we obviously have a much smaller private pay base they can say well you know we're only going to be twelve thousand dollars for a hip replacement that much of a disparity that biggest one is usually if one is your medium this Fifteen hospitals below point nine\nAnd Boston medical and children's get one point nine two\nTimes what the middle price it was a metal prices so you're talking about almost ... almost twice as much reimbursement for costs and reduce the same procedure then you've got Blue Cross Blue Shield\nComing around saying oh Cosby don't quote me on the knows exactly what we're gonna pay\nSeventy didn't come up with that I even though I Know are is there [laughter] well you would pay five seven and a good ...\nDon't quote me on the numbers exactly but we're gonna pay five Seventy didn't come up with it I Know and I know are is there [laughter] we're going to pay five Seventy to cool the Dickinson who's part of a bigger bigger on both\nBecause clearly Dickinson is part of Mass General and therefore Mass General has some negotiating\nParents at it and then they come to Holyoke again and say we're going to give you three hundred and eighty bucks but at the same procedure in the same area Santa Claus Fifteen miles away but it you only reimbursed and then the top off and I sing I miss is that then Blue Cross Blue Shield sends a letter to her medicine and say we realize that there's been an issue with the price without reimbursement rates\nWere not committed to giving six dollars more for the next four years [noise] so [noise] less than twenty\nDollars over for a year and reimburse within and goes through the night even closer so low priced variants issue so when we want to do is create a minimum wage for hospitals to know if you get paid more or less than point nine so they have to get everyone else but looked at in hospitals that are below them up to point nine within\nTwo mayors that's Ninety percent Ninety\nNine percent of the medium thank you and that would probably put a cap on the ceiling 'cause that's what insurance companies want up say they couldn't increase their rates more than two and a half percent over the next five years or maybe tied to the judge the increases right 'cause that's the whole thing the insurance companies threaten\nThe G. I. C. increases being the state to state health insurance insurance plan okay I'm\nSorry I'm that they're saying oh well we\nTurn around and give her medical center point nine and ... percent of the of the medium run up to go increase rates over here which is not true it's a sixty seven million dollar fix to bring Fifteen hospitals up to the up to a level that give them sustainable for insurance companies and their world fifty seven million dollars\nSubject in first class flights and drinking water and you'll be fine\nThere are obviously many issues involved in the healthcare and this is one of them and we could spend the rest of our time for sure talking about health care about it I Would like to get your perspective on another major issue for the legislature which is the education uh funding ... across the commonwealth\nAgain an issue that died in the legislature and died but it didn't get through the legislature last session it will be back because the funding formula is critical critics in cities and towns across Massachusetts how's that going to work out or what should work out and your judgment\nAnd I would say two things I mean how about education you almost have three sections ready to early education then of course elementary and secondary and so I'm middle school and high school and then hire at but focusing on high school and folks on high school and elementary with the chapter Seventy funding that's where education funding comes from the state to our cities and towns\nAround chapter Seventy chapter Seventy the general laws and that's where the funding that that that's what's crazy formulas comes right out among other things chapter Seventy yes to the rub is\nSince opening day so you're forgiven for not being up to speed here's a cheat sheet to help you sound like the authoritative baseball fan\nYou've always wanted to sound like and here to help us all sound authoritative\nWe have to Goldman north Hampton resident a member of savor the society of American baseball researchers a baseball historian\nWho has much to share with us and so I Would like to go through some of these pieces that are in the times today\nThis under the page that is facing the cheat sheet itself doesn't get any better to clubs rich and history and cash collide\nAnd I'd like your perspective as we go through this do Goldman reading your dateline Boston there'll be no underdogs than a hundred and fourteen ths World Series which opens at Fenway Park today\nThe Washington, George Dodgers have gone three decades without a title but have spent about one point four billion in salaries to claim the last six nationally west grounds the Boston Red Sox you know that quaint little team though just plain that nice little stadium that you know that just hates that evil empire\nThe Boston Red Sox who will try to win their fourth championship in the last Fifteen Years outspent\nEvery other team what to do that again the Boston Red Sox outspent every other team this year with the payroll roughly two hundred and thirty million dollars to talk about an evil rich empire the Boston or Yankees Red Sox what do you have to say about that do Goldman or you\nKnow manipulation I mean every year it changes who spent the most it depends upon who's contracts are ending when last year it was the Dodgers two years ago it was the Yankees fifth year it's the red Sox they're all big market teams they all have a lot of money they're spending money\nUm you know take either one in terms of who's the evil empire\nAll have a lot of money they're spending money\nUm you know take either want in terms of who's the evil empire\nOoh we have moral equivalency are you going to be able to walk out of the studio today world fluency was in the evil empire Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and who is the richer spends the more money to eat\nWell morally speaking the Yankees are still the evil empire I mean they have a history of evil that goes far far back so they can't quite catch up\nTo ... oh I think they can let's turn to another part of the article history to remember and forget\nThe Dodgers were the first team to integrate with their landmark promotion of Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn in Nineteen forty seven the red Sox who held a sham try out for Robinson in Nineteen forty five were the last was pumped see green in Nineteen fifty nine how 'bout that\nWell because the red Sox for the most racist team the Yankees by the way we're very close behind them and a Yankees executive George Weiss with the one who said um well uh we don't want to a black player 'cause I'm I'm a Westchester fans don't want the N. word folks you know out on the field in front of them so\nReal yes so there was there was racism or there was an auto racing games and the and and and the idea is to\nOur where the worst there is no doubt about it they were the last to integrate and that's partly why they were such terrible team in the Nineteen fifties\nRight and the Yankees uh were late to bringing African Americans to the major leagues but Elson Howard of course was a tremendous baseball player and was in some ways the face of the Yankees along with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra and then I\nThink he was he was a great ballplayer supposedly Casey Stengel said essentially we finally got a black player and he didn't use the term black um and he can't run a really yes who so there was a lot of ugliness lot of ugly and it's a lot of oh enough yeah\nLet me ask you this on a more upbeat note here's also from the piece today in the times this World Series has the first to minority managers how score from Puerto Rico\nAnd Dave Robertson born in Japan Japanese mother in an African American father only two other teams have minority managers I guess the end of the anger at all but here in this World Series to managers from minority groups\nAnd both managers played during their careers for the Dodgers and\nThey pay for the other team yeah and in fact the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers is a hero in Boston okay I'm going to crawl underneath the table now and All right go ahead tell the story of Alex ... go ahead do it but make it quick please mean\nDay Robb Dave where I was I'm Sorry well David Roberts was the man who stole the base against Mariano Rivera ... for the two thousand and four playoffs when the red Sox were behind three to nothing and in the ninth inning\nWhen he barely buy up a finger stole second base event scored the tying run in the ninth inning which then led to the red Sox not only winning game for but\nFive six and seven correct and then following that the world series correct the\nFirst time in eighty six years so they Roberts is still even though you know he was a late season acquisition he was a relatively seldom you substitute a pinch runner in that game he is a hero in Red Sox nation\nSo let me go through a bit more of this history with you and get your perspective do Goldman number of savor the side of American baseball researchers baseball historian this is a piece of since you've just tortured me with the memories of the stolen base against\nMariano Rivera and the red Sox coming back and breaking the curse of the band being oh\nLet me read you this last graph if I might quote the only player with two thousand bats for both teams is bill ...\nIs oh ville Wagner [laughter] oh I'm ... and feel better already built Butner who hammered\nFor the Dodgers in the Nineteen Seventy four will series and it was such a valued member of the Nineteen eighty six red socks that manager John McNamara left him in at first base in the bottom of the tenth inning of\nGame six against the Mets so that button there could be on the field when the red Sox wanted all parentheses this plant that don't work out you\nKnow it did not um being that I Am a Mets fan I was very happy to\n... Oh yes I'm Sorry and their salaries but I think the joy and you're a Mets fan because\nBecause I grew up in New York when I was seven years old the miracle Nineteen sixty and I met one of the world series I became a Mets fan in New York you really can only root for one team you have to be against the other hand I became a Mets fan\nAnd Joan holiday you know making the point before we went on the air during holidays in Vermont you belong to you\nToday that this is not the only city where if there are two teams you have to take a side\nYeah you have to pack in in Illinois you're either a cubs fan or you are a White Sox fan but there are people who are cardinals fans to yes in Illinois which I find really weird\nWell because you're getting pretty close to they are pretty close in St Louis I've been in St Louis on the cubs were coming into town and there were a ton of cardinals fans visiting there so they they go to each other's ballparks and on the current events are actually very well behaved the cubs fans are not\nNo they're not as\nWell let's look at one more piece before we take our break and then we're going to come back and talk about one of the players from Los Angeles who Boston fans love to hate but first we would be remiss if we did not invoke the name\nOf Babe Ruth mentioned as follows Babe Ruth parentheses this is after all the New York times inferences you got to say they are doing pretty well at differentiating between their reporting and their editorializing not perfect\nBut pretty well they're not perfect they perpetuated the myth of the curse of the band being and when they said that uh uh the red Sox traded Ruth in order to fund known in that\nOK well here they go again that\nWas wrong because no no no no it was five years after\nIt was all well let's hear that let's hear what they report today they being the New York times this is the one hundredth anniversary of the red Sox third and last World Series title with\nBabe Ruth correct it is also the first time the Dodgers and the red Sox had met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen Ruth pitched a fourteen an incomplete game in game to which the red Sox won on their way to the title but about a year after the Nineteen Eighteen World Series\nHarry crazy the red Sox owner and the theatrical producers sold rooster the Yankees to raise money to produce the musical known and that and that's what it's inaccurate\nThis transaction was said to be a disaster for Boston baseball but it gave the world tea for two and the Yankees a legend and you say part of that is wrong what would they did give the Yankees the legend\nOf they did but Harry frizzy did not a ... no no no net onto Broadway until Nineteen twenty five\n... takes time you have to take that much time you know that that's been ...\nYou know condensed in it distorted and\nYou know I'm at the time a lot of the commentators were saying that Babe Ruth was a cancer on a team and good riddance to him and you know he had had a great year in Nineteen Nineteen Harry for his he was getting rid of ballplayers he was having battles with van Johnson the president of the American league at the time was trying to force them out of the league\nAnd so he was selling players but not in order to find\nIngrid ballplayers he was having battles with van Johnson the president of the American league at the time was trying to force them out of the league and so he was selling players but not in order to finance no no no not\nBe an expert or at least be able to say get the world series begins tonight we'll continue our conversation with Goldman right after this\n[noise]\nThis is bill new WHM\nStephanie Miller and you share my feelings on Twitter you set up Ralph Nader's on my TV riffing Democrats\nIn saying that

I'm more or consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well this or do you START I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coated paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill ... maybe the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nOh you are absolutely right or that if the other thing is that the police the Iranian ah generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill or the other thing is that we have we now have bacteria that will degrade a Styrofoam\nAnd and other plastics in the landfill so you know that this\nThat these objections these attempts to ban things are just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we say about the anti corporate anti technology but yeah go fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something else because of that about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we're talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia or we're seeing a stuff come through that that's a marijuana get shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship\nAnd I asked him we had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that goes through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid that liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what your caller explosive comes up as because I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through\nBut my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination and I said\nIf you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carries\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer when a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray\nYou know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it\nThat's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... and red flag and pass along a in fact it's my understanding that checked\nBaggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo die we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangest doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that the stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages or you know flat flat letters or could probably sail through and then maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea laws\nNow I just it just struck me that if that's within our grass I but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before it gets into the supermarket suing kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria\nThey'll people freak out and and and unfortunately with bears a you know that panic attack is often what you will trigger the bears to act aggressively\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia up and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try and keep them confined up there\nWell we try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like

if\nAnd thanks for joining me hey thank you for having me Lars it's an honor thank you so\nIt's a pleasure to have you on so tell me about this race and tell me about your opponent who hates Donald Trump more than any other Democrat in America\nThat is the way to start it you know it's funny we've uh everybody's asked us why we've run you know I'm a I'm a business guy I would've distillery Lars I don't know if you knew that or not I was with my life and make\nA well God Bless you I Love whisky you know I had to buy them for for a job Thomas the next time I'm back in Charlottesville but I like\nThis is Joe and I we were pretty good friends and and um but no I you know we make whiskey and I'm also still in counterterrorism but I'm also senior consult them at the Pentagon for electronic warfare and countermeasures so I don't have much of a\nOf a political background but people are asking why I was running and it was really when I was building my distillery was a regulatory\nBurdens and the fact we're being attacked by lobbyists and I never had any control and\nI'm like if I don't get involved you know at some point um I don't know what I'm going to do and that's why I actually got into politics I explain this to people that it's in my DNA my service and what I wanted to do and I don't need this job I don't need a retirement and the fact is I was fighting for my wife's company and I and I had a lobbyist tell me one time large who said hey\nIf you're not at the dinner table you're on the menu and um I'll never forget that comment he also called me collateral damage and military that's rough but so they asked her why she ran she goes well I I resist Donald Trump that that was\nThat is a reason for running you know she she's a sort of a fly and candidates who are district she has multiple homes you know she's a sixty minutes producer her daughter's Olivia wild um so it's pretty interesting is that I actually ran because I thought I could help people based on my business and military and foreign policy experience\n... sooner answer was ...\nI you know and I get to service the American dream Lars I mean I came from food stamps and I get to run for Congress I mean he gets to do this right what other country\nYou know gives you an opportunity like that and then you know it's funny I'm Talking sort of normal\nYou know English ease right for Ginia southern boy let's have a good old time you know and let's go kick some butt and for her it's all about resist Trump G H Trump and anything he does she hates and she's very very clear about it and she might she might have Trump more than any other candidate in the country\nOr that is that that's interesting it's interesting that you're up against somebody like that and the Virginia voters might embrace her\nWell I mean we just we had a poll this morning and and we knew that there was one of the ninth hole say we're tied and the other ones we've done pretty well\nBut it's been interesting that um there are certain sectors in my district you know Charlottesville and end up closer to northern Virginia I don't know if you know the SARS my district as big as the New Jersey and parts of Delaware it's Twenty one counties I'm there seven hundred and thirty thousand people spread on this massive\nDistrict it looks like a dragon riding a scooter I'm the way that it sort of gerrymandered into\nYou know right now though we're probably about ten points ahead so we're feeling pretty comfortable but it's been a real slog needs a new candidate NO NAME id but I've had to learn my learning curve has been straight up but I got to tell you what right now are feeling pretty good\nWell I Would imagine you would be I Would imagine that the folks and look the commonwealth has become more blue it's not quite blue eyed but it might be purple especially the northern end but it but it's always struck me as a place that was really a freedom loving plays uh where were the people there for the most part I Want to you know a different kind of government\nThan most of the the left coast to the right coast I'm stuck here on the left goes surrounded by liberals but I find that when you ask people about specific issues are often more conservative than you might guess based on who gets elected to Congress\nI think it's who's coming into into the commonwealth you know we Virginia was the first comment but I'll tell you a large I'm Virginia born and raised right I I mean\nI was born in the bustling metropolis of analysis right and my dad live down near Charlottesville and then goes ana county um I've seen a huge change since ... you know I was a kid and yeah I was in the military went around the world but what I'm saying is that it seems that and I know this\nIt sounds like almost there is no common sense coalition left it's almost like there's this progressive and I made up this word ... where people saying that the ... I Can't I have always steered government or even being in it and and supporting the constitution limited government has always been sort of where I'm always err on the side of liberty\nAnd when I see now is is that people seem to just want somebody to take care of them in a sort of scary that that American Dream or that that individual is that we all\nThink is part of the fabric of our country the DNA of our constitution it seems that some people now saying that the government is there to help them or protect them and I think the government is usually there just to sort of um enforce equal misery amongst the populace and so I I'm just trying to get this liberty main backer this liberty same\nBack into this campaign but also back into the commonwealth 'cause it's it's where I was born and raised I Love this\nI Love this place Larson meadows I'm an optimist I Can't help it\nNow and I want to see you do well see I'm One of those ... I find there's I it occurred to me the other day I was thinking most of those on the left or more about well let's do things naturally and let's say you know and all that I said look to me natural is not a group of people who were directed by government they're individuals I mean for most of the history of human beings on this planet\nWe've been self directed people and occasionally we organize into towns are villages or or larger communities like states and counties\nBut but we do that to you know to to say well we need some things done that could really be best done by a government agency and it's tough for individuals run a jail or a police force or or a military and thanks for your service but for those very same people who want things to be natural but the natural order of things I think is not to have\nHuman beings being told this is how you're going to live your life so I'm all about you pushing for liberty in Virginia as well what's your website so people can help you out with the campaign\nSearch Denver for Congress dot com and uh my Twitter is Denver the number for a VA yeah if you go to my Twitter Denver for Congress or just to let you know large somebody stole that

the\nBiggest question that a lot of people ask is where does this evidence live from two thousand two for this gentleman a vet not even a gentleman but a person that created bombs and all of a sudden we have evidence from two thousand two why was this guy not on a watch list and then\nA gentleman but a person that created bombs and all of a sudden we have evidence from Tucson ugly to why was this

do things that feel\nNice and distribute money or to our favorite Cole says and I'm just create a generous welfare state and that's what they did in the night and send them to the night lately the science\nOf the government double or Texas or increase the government the government to regulate the economy and the labor markets\nThat was the result was was this sort of have the nineties in society and that they\nThat they intended it was more like in an eye in rand's novel because\nOur big companies are great entrepreneur nuts I'm even are sort of direct dislike him a bird and sports stars like the one board\nThey left sweet they stopped being productive in Sweden because the economy was suffocated was drowning in taxes and regulation or for that he is the Syrian economy David create a single ... jobs in the private sector\nA whole new jobs were created in the public sector and in the end that made it impossible to fund the government of that size so it was a long period of just generally are lagging behind other countries having lower growth rates than the others\nAre but it also and in a terrible financial crisis in the early Nineteen nineties when\nOther ... countries didn't want to lend us money because it didn't seem like we were going to survive for for a long time so for for a brief period of time the central bank country and from that day\nAnd interest rate at five hundred percent to defend the Swedish currency and the cat time even the socialist soon as we said no it's not we can't do this we have to dismantle this experiment before to kill us\nI'm speaking with a Johan Norbert who is a global economist she's with the K to Institute is a senior fellow results were free to choose media which has created Sweden lessons for America\nAnd you demonstrate how Sweden managed to pull itself back from the brink from five hundred percent interest rates and become the fourth most prosperous nation in the world was it easy to persuade people to leave behind those previous policies and go for something that was more free market and lower taxes\nWell it wasn't and uh\nYou know people don't want to give up things that that they get for free or so that\nTook many of 'em on discussion but what really changed the whole thing was was this crisis that the moment and uh you know it's like that old saying that the prospect of being hang in the morning I\nSpoke with his ... you have to focus and concentrate on what's really important and for example our Social Security system and people wanted very generous pensions they had been on this very generous entrance by our politicians but at this\nTime when the economy tanked\nIt seems like everything was going to collapse people realize\nWhen the economy tanked\nAnd it seems like everything was going to collapse people realize that the other two to retool wall so generous pensions built in it all will collapse of the whole Social Security system\nAnd in that case a ... it's a more secure and show or better so the Social Democrats decentralized agreed that we are going to reform the system\nNature use individual else as well um and\nThey did and and it will create it not because they wanted because you'll find that you look awful\nAnd I hate that was the case and in many areas as well eat realizing the economy opening up a deregulate also all which I'm thinking that the businesses like because the incumbents they were also protected from you in\nThe ... just because of this but he realized that\nIt will be possible to fund or a public or a benefits unless we

H. M. V. morning with Bob clarity and the nice [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSure our number was before the red Sox gotten good art was a Pittsburgh Pirates fan and uh this had to do with ah one Roberto Clementi\nAnd I had what happened was this would have been in Nineteen Seventy one and I had never seen Willie Mays play and so are you or try to get tickets to see him play the match or does or when he was still with the San Francisco giants\nWhen ever the giants came to town because Willie Mays it's started his career with a New York giants\nOr it was a big thing that always sold out when they like the match so I couldn't get new maps and so the nearest one was Pittsburgh and I saw Willie Mays up play three games in Pittsburgh and gets the Pittsburgh Pirates and all three games will one by Roberto Clemente okay\nSo then I became as big pirates fan big Clemente train and of course ... not long after that and they went to the world series against great all it's lost the first two games\nOf the world series and then came running back to when the ... so\nSo that was my team for a long time or less on my team anymore so I'm twenty seven right now the college report Roger by Dylan Chevrolet the no pressure no games no gimmick dealer on main street in Greenville\nIt's time to stop playing politics with public health I'm Chris Collins\nGreenfield health departments in trouble but

dollars from the budget this past spring\nI'm very upset really what uh what's happened really you've sort of cut the legs from under us really you know we've done a lot of good work I Believe in prevention up particularly uh my interest is a pathologist so it's been in the suppression of smoking\nThe department only helping veterans leaves in early November the council has passed the first

that cloud computing deal is worth thirty four billion dollars IBM's biggest ever acquisition calling it a game changer IBM CEO Ginny Ron ... said the deal makes IBM the world's number one hybrid clap provider\n... these got to shoulder problems they've been kind of nursing him all year long you had to wonder like what was going to happen there\nSo there was a definite doubts about the could this team the team that we saw it all year dominate\nBecause they actually dominate when the games are really really really on the line and ah so well well they did [laughter] it was quite a lot of observations of this thing that really got me first of all the dark blue shirts as I've said many times I'm a\nI like uniforms okay and I like ah teams to wear certain uniforms so delighted to win back in August and we went to a game at great seats at Fenway Park and saw David Price a pitch you probably should have been the envy people who knows he just he pitched his heart out and really found himself which is\nAn interesting thing a he has never had a success in the postseason he gets his pitched in many many games like nine games all along has never won a and he's always kind of a succumb\nTo pressure they recall it because these are the the people that are criticizing him and the people that were brown socks in gym class but you know whatever these are the people on the radio that criticize\nA guy like David Price who have never been in such a situation themselves by whatever you know the the knock on him was that he kind of was overcome by pressure when you got into really really big game so she's in any type games\nWell looks like he found something he found himself and not only that he wants to pitch every day now I Know I don't care one day two days rest three days it doesn't matter to me there are any which another beautiful game\nLast night as he's been doing all along here so he really has figured some things are so I I don't know what it is and the whole run that he gave up early in the game last night and said look on his face like ... to go again but he really young buckle down and the pitched a great game so\nI don't know is he the MVP or is it ... it's hard to say but it was wonderful to see that but anyway as I was saying we saw him pitching in August and against the Houston Astros at Fenway Park\nAnd they were the red shirts that light and I was always wanted to see them live with the ... the only way they use on Friday nights at home is I I was really excited to see and it was really neat\nNow the dark blue shirts that they where they only where those that friday night on the road it's the only time you'll see them with a dark blue shirts I think the last ... the I mean they look really really good and a ... for some reason I don't know where they made the decision ... going to join us later on in the show\nWho covers the red Sox for ... uh they made the decision to where the dark blue jerseys all through the three games in Los Angeles\nNow they look great number one [laughter] so somebody must have said you know these are like a really good they look a lot better than the draft Gray's maybe we should maybe we should do that so\nSo that was figure it out then David Price figured some things out and block hold the manager core I was a little bit disappointed in car the ... did not play in a single moment of the first two games of the series at Fenway Park\nSo I'm going to get you missing something here especially since he was utility infielder himself Cora was\nI figured that you're you're you're kind of missing something here with ... at this guy really a bears down hard when the games are on the line is really college player\nAnd he might be the heart of this team I mean every everybody respects him and he's the the the designated cheerleader and all that well I guess a core figure some things out because then he played the rock hall throughout the three games with the LA and he was instrumental in the winds of each of those so he figured that out\nAlso at the other thing that I was was a little bit puzzling the team as you say to the catcher all year they had Christian Vasquez platoon in with Sandy lay on all year all year they would alternate games basically and then you get into these games and Christian Vasquez became the catcher of the team was kinda funny but you know whatever\nWorkout nice and that uh that last scene of the last out where they brought in ... sale a to a basically closed is a series out and then he runs into his arms sales about six foot five and\nA Christian Vasquez is a much shorter person and ran into his arms is like a Yogi Berra running into Don Larsen is arms when Don Larsen pits the perfect game in the world series is kind of a cool thing\nSo uh and and again you know the pitcher has to be six five and the catcher has to be five eight in order for that to happen but but it was it was really well and uh so so it ended nicely or the or the red Sox winning you had to get their fourth in Fifteen Years before their fourth\nA world in Fifteen Years\nWell that was an interesting or did you hear that what I'm hearing these noises it's like the kind of noises that you have to worry that the equipments gonna fail pets does it feel north of it anyway yeah it was great and I did stay up for I had and again I had the the\nAnd we

[noise] uh yeah I Would encourage anybody who's even curious to show up because I think there's a Woody Allen lines I maybe not like the hardest part is showing up at a party or you're breaking the inertia and just getting there [noise]\nI also would like to encourage people who don't have much experience and speaking or don't have a lot of confidence around this\nTo show up we've had speakers in the group who are not native English speakers we've had youngest speakers we have an older speakers a it's been really wonderful to have a diverse community because it's interesting for us to hear when another stories and experiences and we all learned from that\nSo I really hope of more people can jump on this path\nAnd I think it's a it's a very scary to show up at something new we don't know anybody and it's also scary to think that you're going to be giving a speech in front of a group of people see combine those two things in it I can understand the hesitancy\nFor someone who thinks that well I don't know if I Want to go to that but really it's obviously there is no obligation to join but you just come and see what it's like and it's really a supportive\nExperience Lindsay's other does\nMaybe seven do so who is a state rep who well she will be a state rep because she has no opposition in November\nIs going to be joining us and she's going to talk about what it means to be a female voice in politics in two thousand Eighteen and and why it's so important that we have female voices in the legislature I Can't wait to hear from her\nOne of those things would you do a ... really are are are found intriguing is that you normally teach people how to speak up for themselves not necessarily a public speaking role bought another rules as well but also speak without notes the three of us who are in the studio here we've been talking with a less risky minutes with none of us using any notes\nDo so I think we're very valuable to people and ... would be one of those who can speak for doll and with all those ... this is a I got really appeals to me because I've seen that the other way where people reached up off of ... not anywhere as near as a for\n... when it's one of the the skills that we do offer in the speaker sisterhood north Hampton um is four speakers to learn that skill because\nUsually when we do begin speaking journey a women will stand up there with their notes in front of them and read it they'll read the speech that they've written and that's perfectly fine and that's what a lot of speakers do they will read speech that they've written but what we want to encourage\nAnd what we see women doing through the process of this journey and it's that they get to a point where they don't have to do it with notes or their notes are minimal they have bullet points or circles in which they've even put pictures so we we offer those skills\nAnd I'll add that beyond the speaking part there's this idea of breaking out of the box behind the lectern I don't know how many of you sat through stultifying PowerPoint crime or the present or it's just you know a zombie behind the screen and you see pictures flashing [noise]\nUm so I feel like this group gives us confidence to use gestures and animate ourselves but you know in an authentic honest way and also if necessary you know bringing some props or tell some stories\nBut the idea is to learn to engage your listener and yeah I think that is best done without a sheet of paper between you and your audience definitely and we talk about things like I contact\nAll those skills are so important and as dean said gestures or so there is a curriculum that takes the speakers history through the uh for the first year of the club and a lot of our members are wrapping that you're up and Angela Lucy or who founded speaker sisterhood is going to be joining us an unveiling the second\nAnd a lot of our members are ... that you're up and Angela Lucy or who founded speaker sisterhood it's going to be joining us\nAn unveiling the second year its curriculum sorry to hear that you know this is going to be Thursday Thursday night this Thursday night six to eight pm here WHM pits the speakers sisterhood north Hampton first anniversary open house there's going to be cake\nAnd please a email me RSVP at Denise votes out of law at ...\nRole thank you to use our news director and thank you for club member genes ...\nThank you for coming in lake Eugene Oregon and they'll say out for using the word ... which is what about all she has great a great vocabulary such a pleasure cruise affected you think you know ... we've got a twenty eight in the morning here on the one at one point far uh W.

provision of the voting rights\nAct by the Supreme Court about three years ago\nRight I'm\nIn some ways I think we're in in some ways I think we're actually worse off than we were before the voting rights act because it gave states when the repeal gave the states are basically unbridled opportunities to write whatever kind of voter suppression laws and they wanted\n'em and\nRight because the Supreme Court of the United states within the Republican majority said there is no more racism in the United states there is no more voter suppression ... everyone can vote we are free and open place\nAnd as long as you are white and rich you can vote\n[noise] indeed um\nWell let me tell you a little bit where I was back in Nineteen sixty five I was Nineteen I was just students sophomore\nUm and I read something or a poster from snack student non violent Coordinating Committee that\nA suggested or that or right after the voting rights act and this was in two or three months after it was an act that that they were wanting to make a big push in Mississippi so I went down with a um a group of other college students or the call was made to about three hundred colleges all over the country\nAnd we went down uh got trained a in non violent protection how to how to do it in a respectful way and then we went out\nIn our case to us southern I'm part of the state and and got a\nAh we helped inform African Americans that they could vote we brought them to the polls and within two years and not because of our efforts particularly but because of the law\nThe number of African Americans in Mississippi went from six percent to about sixty percent that's in two years after the yard so that act was critical he was a critical thing\nI'm now you know you were saying that it mostly affected people of color which I think is true that are also affects the poor the disadvantaged students as well I'm\nA as you know of their new\nVoter suppression techniques that are popping up almost weekly um and and ... mostly is happening in states that are controlled by red legislatures and every ten years or there's a redistricting efforts in one of the biggest\nConcerns is too is who's in charge and so one of the things that I Would love to see is um do change the way redistricting is done well if whoever it might it's\nBased on the census and the state legislators most of

in Denver which is not just to Denver a problem it is in other areas as well is the cost of land acquisition for\nBuilders and then the costs of permits the costs of hiring labor and the costs material new homes are a out of sight and\nBuilders because of the base costs they have for land or things like that they only want to build larger more expensive homes\nTo try to make any profit out of the deal so are you really have to you and your wife really have to concentrate if you want to go ahead and buy now\nOn used homes but housing markets go in cycles and anybody who's been in Colorado where Utah\nFor a long time knows the swings that have occurred in both states with real estate going on a pendulum of extremely high demand followed by a wave of soft demand\nDo you think you and your wife have a little patience and you are do you want to go ahead and pulled the trigger now I'm getting that\nWell we definitely I definitely have patience and I'm looking for a long term and that's kind of relate to what my question was is um ... you know for for folks who by during when it's you know the the market's really hot\nUm are they worse off than than people who buy in a in a buyer's market you know just long term or because\nYou know for for a second home no matter when we got a second home you know housing values are going to be up or down but if if we jumped in when things are very hot um I Would just wonder if long term that would impact our finances that I live in a negative way\nThe way you make that test is by comparing the cost of renting today versus what your effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIs by comparing the cost of renting today versus what your effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIf when you take the cost of the mortgage taxes and insurance and add those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today your best off waiting a while before you buy ...\nIf you can buy a place at a margin that is less than twenty percent higher\nFor current cost of mortgage Saxon insurance versus rent then particularly if you're going to own a property for a significant number of years which in an overheated market like the Denver metro area you want to look at a ownership window of ten years\nYou're comfortable in owning a house for ten years and you can buy a within that that price window I'm Talking about no more than twenty percent higher effective cost per month in rent than go ahead and buy\nOtherwise I'd ... for a down cycle and they always come\nYeah I'm I think I'm a late [laughter] I think our focus is going to be or just you know stick it out and they are and and to help 'em as much towards my student loans as possible for\nThat is a very effective strategy you know a lot of people don't feel like they've really settled down\nIf they're renting a set of owning\nBut that is something that is um in some sense psychological and if you can get your financial house better and order and getting rid of student loans is a great thing to do and rent and let the market find new equilibrium I Would do just that\nJames is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\n... ... ... ... ... it's\nGreat to have you here James here a little muffled sounding right now about\nTo say about that is all a little bit if that is better [noise]\nOkay my old show for you is all with the fortune one of them um they had been contributing to a traditional\nFour one K. or as Seventeen or so years all I can share the eleven percent with ... company match and Jeff ... mom or they had advised that they're going to start off in the wall for one day\nSo I'm kind of an ashtray and semi retired and say I'm all edge additions to check it is about ... years give or take on that you should switch all which would be more beneficial to me\nI Love the idea of you having done a traditional four one K. all these years moving forward doing the raw four O. one K. because whether it'll give you an retirement and your company match that six percent company matches\nWill still be pre tax money even if you do the Roth\nFour one K. moving forward but it by having a pile of money that's pre tax file and a pile of money that's after tax pile which the Roth becomes\nIs extremely helpful and retirement to make sure that you harvest money is you need it\nFrom what would be the most efficient at that time in that year also we have a really good shot that tax rates are going to be higher in the future than they are now and that would make it a potentially better idea\nTo do a raw four one K. instead of traditional moving forward but there is an exception\nAnd let me discuss whether you whether you're an exception you get if you're making\nHuge money and your job then you want to do the traditional because if you're an extremely high income earner the odds are better that you're in a higher tax bracket working then you'll be in retirement\nBut in all I Would say if you're in a very small percent of people would be in this territory\nUm are you single or married married to both of you work ... right if your income is north of a quarter million dollars a year then you'd want to do the traditional hates it so that had that so\nYeah so if you're at one twenty five family income I Would do the raw four one K. moving forward and if you can hang at a ... percent because remember you're going to have to use after tax dollars instead of before tax now\nAnd work they're doing for supporting people with developmental disabilities I become friends\nWith lots of the people

Want to tell you as we move into the Christmas shopping season\nThere's one thing I Want to make sure you don't do through the shopping season that so many people who've done in the past regret so much did you know that if you work for a smaller employer somebody other than a giant company\nAnd if they offer you a four O. one K. did you know the your expenses that you're paying on that four one K. are usually four to five times as much as they are for somebody who works for a giant company\nSmall businesses mid sized businesses face an enormous administrative burden and cost offering four O. one K. plans and those costs in most cases are passed on to you\nIt's weird but it now costs more\nTo have a four one K. if you're employed by a smaller employer than it is for you to have your own IRA or Roth IRA with a low cost company\nAnd that's why I recommend to you that if you do work for a smaller company that you put in to their four one K. only up to the match\nAnd then after that if you're disciplined you put money in your own IRA with one of the low cost companies on my investment guy to collect dot com\nSo this is a terrible problem that why is it that somebody who works for a smaller business which more than half of Americans do\nShould be discriminated against on a four O. one K. plan versus somebody who works for a big company it's just not right especially it harms the long term growth potential the United states if it discourages people from working for a mid size or small business\nThe other experience people can share with you who own rental property by college

I mean like if I'm not gonna give you the book can surround me give you the real answer okay like\nFor ... for instance you know tax reasons yeah insurance or even write\nA voting I mean how do you do that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost of convenience like a lot of people will register in Montana where does the taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll dominant style or they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book and so this is what people really do okay if I give you the really do answer\nWhy I call okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax say you Lisa room from them in their home and you sign up with these\nProbably never use the room but you just pay 'em like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually physically have to own property and know your residency state\nNow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in Connecticut\nAnd that's why we want to find yeah so you're never in Connecticut again right if you go if\nYou go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel in somewhere else in the tri state area and you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut because the big thing and high tax states so we're going to try to come back at you and say wait wait wait wait\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you been here a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been changes state and in this\nConnecticut okay\nSo you're just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been your state and decide to over there\nYeah and practically what most people do is they do for the Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana and so if you\nLook around on the Web and then you'll see where people were posted articles about why they use Montana as their dominant style [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nBut no this mother to pack of

daughter\nYes sir thank you for taking my call Clark I share that certainly\nUm well my daughter is going to be turning Twenty one this coming Sunday and my wife and I have thought to get her started into adulthood to start a a Roth IRA for her\nSomewhat you're definitely not from Wisconsin because in Wisconsin there would be that you'd have a big party at a bar for\nHer [laughter] or to or in our rovers legal during\nAbsolutely absolutely but now we're we're the more fiscally responsible parents and we thought rather than giving her a twenty four pack that will be gone within a few hours\nThat hitting or of wealth IRA that allows for you know hopefully decades\nBut my goodness a twenty four pack that would be gone a few hours do you know do you know how many beer I can actually handle before I'm just like it's over\nWell you're you're probably similar to me I Know that uh I kind of laugh when they put that born on day because I joke with folks that the the beer in my fridge should have died on date because it fit in there so long\n[laughter] yeah I I can handle about one and a half B or before I'm just done\nSure absolutely yeah\nBut so you you are not looking for the alcoholic celebration you're looking for the financial celebration for\nHer ... absolutely and so this roster you're going to do has she ever had one before is this brand new for her this brand new she working\nShe will be a she has a little bit of income right now but I Would expect that by the end of the year she would have at least a thousand dollars of income that\nUh we were planning on opening with a thousand dollars so hopefully by the end of the air she'll she'll actually be graduating and uh hopefully we'll have employment as an elementary school teacher\nJobs is you know are so relatively plentiful\nSo it's not a question of if she can find a job it's just is it going to be the job she wants so yeah I wouldn't worry at all about her crossing the thousand dollar income thresholds so doing a a raw for her for a grand is such a wonderful gift because\nAt Twenty one way but you said she's graduating from college and she's only Twenty one\nYes you know most people don't finish college now till twenty three twenty four\nRight she had she actually had skipped a a year of high school because she entered in advance program with a school up in northwest Missouri and uh it gave her both college credit in high school credits\nAh she found that she didn't particularly like that program is supposed to be a two year program\nBut then she took it upon herself when she found that she would have to go back to high school to finish her a high school diploma at her old high school she decided to contact the president of one of our state universities and\nContact him directly saying you know\nThe problem she was having at the school and he Luther toward the admission officer who then said well if you just get your GED we can go ahead and take those credits in it but she went to college and so what she should have been starting her senior year of high school\nShe was actually a a freshman in college that was about halfway through the freshman year already with the number of credit she had\nYou have one industry has daughter there and what I Love is that she advocated for herself at Seventeen years old and made this happen\nHer and she's got a bright future\nHey that for herself at Seventeen years old and made this happen for her and she's got a bright future in front of her and the wrong doing that at Twenty one the number of times her money will double that thousand dollars will double\nYou're adding I mean just simple math you're adding like a whole additional cycle at least a veteran only doubling by doing it so young\nRight light my question was is is the Roth IRA the best way to go I was\nThree hundred percent ... okay yeah there's not even gray on that that is\nThe perfect thing you can do for her good and\nUm I have a guide I don't know if you've seen it at Clark dot com that's a basic investing guide and he can get that set up an all in like ten minutes time and you're open a shell account and then she can find it with a thousand you're going to give her and she'll be all set\nAll right very good I appreciate your advice on that thank you\nWell that is great and congratulations to her doing something as like a throwback getting an undergraduate degree by your twenty first birthday John joins us on the Clark Howard show how John\n... thanks for taking my call a lot from the over the years\nWell thank you very much you have something that's been pitched to you you want to run by me telling me\nAbsolutely I heard you talk about the long term care insurance but mostly the traditional type and we are destroying insurance agent I my uh state planning attorney who commands a whole life policy\nThat he got the ability to use for a certain amount of long term care insurance up to ten years at a certain amount for both me and my wife\nIt's a very smart move by the insurance industry\nHas the long term care market has mostly exploded\nBecause the number of people who claim long term care and has turned out to be far larger than the insurance actuaries expected and so the big push in the insurance industry is what you heard the pitch for what happens is you buy a whole life policy\nWhere they ride or for what sometimes is referred to as a living benefit\nWhere if you never need long term care you just have a death benefit that goes to the beneficiary designation the policy\nOn the other hand if you do need long term care\nWith money that would have been paid out at death instead is paid for the benefit of care for a long term care facility care in your home a nursing home whatever up to the limits that the policy calls for and you've purchased\nSo for the insurance industry what it does is it caps their wrists and what it does for you is you have a premium certainly you pay and you know that that benefit up to that dollar amount will be there for you okay is that how it was explained to you\nBoth very much so I I guess the question is I've always followed but I think is your philosophy to go which a\nTerm insurance ...\nI'm well covered there and I was wondering what I'd be too much for that to get a whole like policy that I don't need to check that\nYes and we're dealing with a very broken system so long term care there are a small number of companies that still sell it on my long term care information that Clark dot com and you don't know what will happen with the premiums if you buy one is I was so despise you certainty\nBut what it does do is you're paying a great deal of a premium for that certainty\nSo ... are you someone who could ... you might not like it but you could afford the premiums if over the year the IRS the long term care premiums escalated\nYes that's true\nIf that's your case go with traditional long term care insurance and go with one of the mutual insurers that are on the list like um northwestern mutual is an example would be a better choice Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nHey ... certainly got a problem\nA Charlene

go work for anybody else in our chosen profession or whatever period of time is legal and whatever\nState ... state of Massachusetts is rolling back is covering this not to compete because it's clear that industry of Massachusetts has not been nearly as dynamic and the tech field is it has been in states that have done away with governance\nAnd employers are in a position in most states where they get\nYou to sign one of these covenants where you can't go work for anybody else pay a bit thumb on you even if they dump you you can't go work for anybody else for a period of time can't earn a living even when they don't want you anymore\nFinancial Times of London reports today that one in four American workers now one in four\nAre uncovered is not to compete and this is something is national policy if we want to do something for the American people\nAnd allow people to earn a decent wage we will all lemonade employers' ability except maybe in the executive suite\nTo require

to go places you pay for parking you end up it over ten thousand dollars\nNew vehicles cost a fortune\nAnd think about it if you instead of driving a new vehicle that one that's out there that you're tired up but it still works just fine and you're treating it so bad\nWhy don't you go pay somebody to detail it make it look brand new again on the inside make it feel like a new vehicle to you again and keep driving that thing instead of spending all that money\nOn those new wheels because you know it's like being on a hamster wheel right because as soon as you get that new vehicle and just a few months it's not so new anymore either is it\nBrian's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian\nHow are you there oh sorry [noise] live life has been driving the same car for twenty two years\nTwenty two okay how did you end up coming right here right now the talk about me trying to get people to keep a car ten years or longer and your wife runs a vehicle for twenty two years one last try one lasted twenty two years Brian\n... a Toyota Camry a Toyota Camry and how much in terms of repairs and things like\nHenri a Toyota Camry and how much\nIn terms of repairs and things like that anything major like that other people would have said I don't have the stomach for fixing the Simon a bail anything like major happen over those twenty two years\nIt's been a great car we love it and we're thinking about getting another one now it's the same transmission same engine been a great car fan on tests as\nWell that that is a great story to hear well how can I be of help because it sounds like you're the one who should be leading other people here are your wife should be\n[laughter] ... well so we're looking for another car I'm probably another so that I can read and um I Would consider buying use but hurricane was here a year ago hurricane was it\nA ... man out here in Florida and\nThat yeah I'm concerned that there were cars that were flooded and maybe someone got their car repair themselves and that information never makes it to the car title and I'm going to end up with a bad car\nAnd that could happen and that's why a you know when I talk about checking vehicle title history that's only one step of two major ones when you're looking at buying a used vehicle on the other\nIs to have the vehicle inspected by the whoever the Toyota mechanic is who's taking care of your wife's Toyota for the last twenty two years because they'll be able to tell they'll be able to there'll be signs that they know to look for\nWhere they'll be able to see if a vehicle was suffered any water damage\nOkay now we're far you know the um I should tell you we're far enough away\nFrom Hurricane Irma now that it would be less likely that there was still be a flood vehicle somebody would be trying to pass off in the marketplace that could happen but it's not as much an issue as it is in the immediate six months after a major hurricane\nOkay but do you and I make another into yes and that is that Toyota um is having\nTrouble getting people interested in buying ... was and cameras\nBecause the market has shifted so much too little SEVs\nAnd in fact traditional passenger cars are now down to a third of the car market or vehicle market from being nearly two thirds of the market just a few years ago\nBecause I look around everybody's driving\nA heavily these smaller as TV's which are basically just an SUB looking top put on the same car platform as a passenger car may have been so I get pretty good fuel economy and all that but that's what people are interested in so you may find you can buy a new Camry\nAt a fantastic price\nYeah and not even by one that's a year or two oh since since your wife likes to keep a vehicle for two\nDecades she can go ahead and get a new one potentially instead of a used and not have to worry about the flood thing\nSo you think I might find good prices on families than your cameras so\nYeah oh yeah I mean you know the the sedan market is true so on the left right now\nWell I I've been talking to dealerships and I started with a Costco program and um I've been trying to negotiate lower right and I am and I'm finding dealers don't really want to go lower and all that\nWell that's because the costs go car buying program is such a a missile the equivalent of the largest car dealer in the United states and so the price that costs go member debts the Cosco car buying program is going to be a very good price\nAnd I'm curious equipped is your wife once what kind of price are you seeing on a new\nCamry\nOn a Camry s e the Cosco price and I have it and at that I Want to pass on to you and the Louis listeners a Camry s e out the door\nIncluding taxes and all this junk fees that Costco price is twenty four two and change and um\nSo then I started talking to other dealers and the problem that I found I was asking for okay what's your best price including or dealer fee\nSo finally I started asking them okay it out the door coffee and they were adding on all kinds of junk I learned that when you negotiate for a car you have to get out the door the otherwise they attack on all kinds of stuff right when you thought you had a good price\nYeah the the Wednesday drunk the versus the friday John ... versus the Tuesday junk food crisis yeah ... yeah it's really crazy isn't it so I'm not a you know I don't know twenty four are you comfortable with that are you still want to accused\nI think I'm more comfortable that\nSo I think the cause of the history of ownership and how much your wife is like having the cameras she's already had this one will seem completely different because technology's changed so much in two decades I'd say why don't you splurge and buy or the new one\nAnd that we're coming out of my mouth will is with us on the Clark Howard show how long will ... will how can I serve you\nUm I just had a a retirement and that's a question like I didn't help that they do a ... foot center said and and I work for a while which I Love\nFor lunch and then I uh two are set into my Roth IRA us they got a switch in that letter lack sent out the Roth IRA then put in maybe three percent back to work for a while but I just wanted to get your input on that idea\nOkay so explain why you're thinking of flipping\nUm just because I work doesn't match fly a ... and just in case I ever needed to pull out the principle of the Roth\nOkay tax free\nAll right that that's a great idea the thing is though make sure you do that raw with one of the real low cost providers\nSawyer preferred on that you talk about pretty regularly so\nAnd so you want to put in the amount you'll end up putting into the raw is it fifty five hundred or how much total would you put in\nI wouldn't accept that area\nYou would Max's every year for her and then do the other yeah I mean your employer not giving you a match makes that makes perfect sense okay yeah\nOther yeah I mean your employer not giving you a match makes that makes perfect sense okay if you could consider are you married well\nA lot Larry the other thing I thought about doing this possibility I stood at Lowe's and just don't have it harder and ended up quicker\nOkay I liked that idea if you go ahead and put into the rock the max and you're going to be disciplined to do that popped if the five hundred India stop contributing anything to the four oh one K. at work since there is no match and use that three percent you would have put in their towards the student loan debt\nThat was shot out of the world shown real disciplined saving for retirement already\nAnd there's always this issue you know what should go toward savings or retirement and rainy day in which go towards debts student loan debts kind of sit there like like these heavy weights
