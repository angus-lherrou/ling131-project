obviously with the wind or on the road but he named off some of the things that really bothered him as far as turnovers not shipping into the zone when you have a three nothing lead may be protecting the lead a little better\nUm based sauce getting beat in the face soft on friday night one he said all that\nAnd then towards the end of your interview it was kind of like this is you know a point where I told the team this is what you work for and you said the validation point how do you play that in in the next twenty four hours which one do you accentuate more do you mix them I don't I'm not sure where you go from here as a coach well I don't\nKnow either I mean uh you know we've always talked about um good coaches know when to get out of the way and this is a team obviously now that has a ton of swagger and I thought uh I never felt that they were\nNot the favorite teams and they just played like they were supposed to win the hockey game and when you get when your team started doing that\nI'm In his coach said he's not going to make any tweaks they have a system that they're comfortable with\nThey know if they play up to their standards so that means within the system if they if they had the work ethic and the commitment\nIn the focus then they're going to win most nights and that doesn't you know I I don't think that that it matters who they're playing if they do play up to that standard ... they now have the skill set in the program to compete in to win on any given night and I think uh I think that's what he's excited about\nI mean he's doing a post game interview and you and you ask them about\nYou know what he's happy but he's going to point out obviously the mistakes that were made their obvious to everybody to face off the turnover is that the blue line those are things that we saw against RPI or didn't come back to to hurt them against that team and it didn't come back to hurt him tonight I think that you know the focus for the next twenty four hours is\nLet's let's pay attention to those minor details which may seem minor but could result in being on the wrong side of the score so uh there's no question that you know the the team that gets off the bus with the best players wins um but the coaching has a huge huge\nUm factor in winning and losing especially when you have a ... and I I enjoy looking over the bench when I can and watch what he's doing it and how he is sort of a manipulating massaging the steam and the the line match ups and things so I think\nI think the minute men have the right players I think they have the right coach and more important is probably most importantly they have the right mindset everybody involved with the program or the everyone's pulling in the same direction\nAnd or even you know even the fans are tons of optimism most of it unwarranted until tonight you know what the optimism coming to the season was\nA surprising to me that you know that that people were that\nAre excited about what might happen this season\nUm you'd said I think early on you know it's it's two or three years away but there's definitely you know on the up word slope um but boy they really made a statement tonight I thought playing on the road opening night against the number one team the country\nAt Ohio State it's just a big big stage and they were not uh they didn't seem to have to buy it at all\nI agree with you I think that they looked like the big underdog that they supposedly were and play the great game and you're right above the coach cobble again that time out he called with five minutes to go five fifty nine when this team looks gas I mean he didn't hesitate to use them and everything you said was fought on and\nWhen you asked about changes I didn't know if he threw throw you were throwing the fishing line in to see maybe because I think the only thing that maybe the question is is is the goal in you know what mine said\nDid you know did they come out and accomplish part of what most of what they wanted to do does he want to see a\nA Philly limburg on the big stage as well and see how reacts or does he come back with memory and go you know try to sweep that way I think that's

DNA\nDo you call it the DNA and uh this strikes me at the like CSI white shark here ah you\nCut is kind of is\nYou can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because the way they use this area and a common place I learn from you\n... well that's the part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and out recently that sharks been there so in that case it sampling water when we're measuring what we call them by a mental DNA that's where the ... in the DNA comes from\nUm we don't know how long that DNA will last before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer is to try to measure how long the white tricks DNA can remain in a particular before it's completely gone but in the case of the wet suit that was different\nBecause the sharks DNA had become trapped in the ... show in many ways that as a standard forensic\nTechniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now I'm Rene biologist you're kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe I read from the reporting that the U.S has more unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen or that nationwide we have ... more than fifty and Florida has a lot of attacks\nIs there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data and\nOr something like the shock lab um accumulating the data\nWell there's a number of factors involved in this so one factor is now I get so much media attention that when these incidents occurred they always get reported fifty sixty eight years ago you know it was sometimes never reported or sometimes that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually don't refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of the shark\nSo we simply refer to them a shark bite so until we figure out you know whether the sharks intent\nWas to deliberately attacked some thing um it could be just simply mistaken identity shark didn't know what it was a thought it was a\nA food item it bit into it and it decided we just don't taste good so that really isn't an attack that's I'm a sampling if you will but nonetheless a little bite from a big shark can do a lot of damage and what's remarkable\nAnd what we've seen in more recent years\nIs the severity of some of these little bites so to speak and how many people survive those and match really attributed to first responder um responses and and and saving these people\nSo we're getting more data because we have more survivors and we move quicker and our communication system allows us to know when something's going on in Cape Cod and two weeks later going on in San Diego county that's why\nWell that's one of the reasons the other reason is there are more people using the ocean recreation than ever before in history and in the U.S we have locations in our country where people can use the water year round and they do so when you think about\nHow people use the ocean now for recreation and how much time different user groups spending the ocean like surfers swimmers but the borders waiter stand up paddle borders when you look at the amount of time they actually spending the ocean now is\nExponentially greater than it was twenty thirty fifty years ago so that's the other thing that we have to put into context\nThey're more simply more people in the ocean than ever before\nWe've looked at it from the human point of view that sauce homo sapiens and why we're now going to turn when we come back from the shock point of view what how does the shark see us why the sharks in California particularly close in and what is it changing pattern does climate change matter here does El Nino matter here\nI'm speaking with a ... but Dr professor Chris Lowe he's the director of the shark lab California State

good to be back with you I think this a lot of Iranian oil I think has been termed a is one very powerful way in the run up to sanctions that the Iranians are looking to offset some of the impending

evening to you\nA good evening thanks for having me uh I think it's still too early to call\nThe relationship between us and turkey at budding romance or certainly the release of us past it Andrew

to the men beach issue\nOr to Iran sanctions and to others us hostages including three State Department employees so until\nThese other issues I dealt with I think us Turkish relations will continue

to contribute information that disturbs the relationship between Washington in Riyadh\nNow I think are the ones sees this crisis as a major opportunity to extract concessions both economic and diplomatic or from Saudi Arabia or ... she was a a an already a critique of fat on and he was in the inner circle of the\nThe Saudi Government uh\nBut then it lately defected or to the Turkish side

embarrassing details of this gruesome murder and I think we will continue to see this\nOngoing negotiation behind closed doors\nA puzzle about the source of that information a Turkish security is very good MIT\nI I find it impossible to imagine that two aircraft from Saudi Arabia\nA discouraging Fifteen very vigorous man and more to of Saudi nationals ... was not watched entirely by MIT coming in and going out\nAnd did and does the MIT have a role in this or did they watch this happen because it suits here to one or is this opportunistic for them as well\nNow what we know at this point is that was close surveillance off the conflict genital of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul it's safe to assume that there was both audio and video surveillance\nOr as well as there were some a human assets are among the staffers are off this conflict but this does not necessarily mean that a Turkish government or Turkish intelligence had the ability or the foresight\nOr to realize what was happening and prevent it I think that the the dilemma he ... for the Turkish government is as some of the evidence or that can prove what ... actually transpired\nA would be too explosive to release because it would also

as it came out I made an effort to find time to watch it and my wife and I went to see it a earlier this week\nAnd I have a review on behind the black and titles first land Tripoli a triple lump trivialize the lunar landing because even though they do include the American flag out on the moon and they do include that you know it's very clearly an American achievement\nAnd they make some comments there and they're about how this is an American a triumph\nUm there's no question that the movie\nCompletely ... uh eliminated the Cold War aspect of it the American triumph there of\nAnd in that sense it it was so focused on Neil Armstrong's personal story his personal in inner workings which I'm not sure I Believe in any way that they completely miss that greater epic tale which is one of the reasons the film falls flat\nAnd why it's not getting great word of mouth apparently\nThe only reason I don't think it's getting good word of mouth is that they portray all the astronaut has decided this likeable I mean on strong in particular are seen as glum sulking and not to kill it and ... introverted he also is portrayed as a jerk who really treats his wife and kids badly\nMy wife said Diane said I Want to ... I wanted to smack him upside the head and I kind of agree\nYou know some of the ashes no question that they get where they had to go they had they had a ... or their families a lot of them\nAnd they therefore jerks I mean I just have interviewed a lot of astronauts they admitted but a lot of 'em really try to make up for it and a lot of ways this film didn't give that impression it just showed Armstrong as a jerk\nAnd and why would anyone want to see a film about this you know there's a great epic tale here and if you just focus on a person's floors in this epic tale you lose it and I think that's what's happened with this film\nJob above the detail about Armstrong I saw him give a speech once said one of my at my brothers graduation he he he he became an inspirational speaker\nAnd uh the the the event I remember I recall vividly was because\nUm the Nineteen eighty election or right before the election this spring the election when there was great anxiety about the United states and its strength in the world and he ... he made an inspirational speech and the crowd was thrilled\nYeah and so he was translating was a war hero to I mean he fought in Korea he was translating hum a view of America that really isn't something Hollywood's Tamil you're with these days I'm trying to be generous here\n[laughter] I Know you are but I I'm I'm really not to be generous I think my original per opinions were correct that this is Hollywood and the modern intellectual communities refusal and disdain almost\nOf ... of of the America that makes it possible the free America makes it possible to have their opinions and they just don't want to do it you know Neil Armstrong landed on the ... he was on the first words from landing tranquility base here the ego has landed and I heard him\nSay it and you can listen to the tapes and hear him say it he said that with joy and enthusiasm\nBecause he knew he had just accomplish something grand for this country needs country\nWhich is with equal represented well I'm Ryan Gosling when he says those words he says the eagle as landed almost as an afterthought almost for luck\nThat only eat like he's uncomfortable saying it has a Canadian life I think it's as an actor and intellectual community doesn't want to be a proud unabashed American which there's no question Neal Armstrong was\nWell for heaven sakes that was a day of days I mean I'm not going to see the movie maybe I'll have glimpses of it you know when it's on Amazon Prime and two years something like that but for heaven's sake those those last moment Bob before he settled down do they do do do they do those adequately I mean that was that was that you know what\nThey don't do it as well as they could they because they make the landing they they they insert you're looking at the lunar surface with this giant deadly looking crater which was there and then they show the surface flying by super fast which wasn't true he was he was descending almost vertically\nBy it and he was worried and I'm Renee exaggerate the reality instead of really ... they tried to show how he's running out of fuel and he's really but they didn't do it as well as they could if they only did he he was searching for a landing\nSite and they didn't really shown that and\nThat's unfortunate he flew down by them so that was the ...\nThey they do say I'm going to go to Manuel here yeah and you do have the quote from\nAll different uh this is a Boulder field um but once again what happened is he went to Manuel and he's hoping ... over the surface looking for a place to land and instead they show it as he's it's like a plane coming into a Boulder field like a plane literally the ground shooting passed and he's\nSuddenly he brings it down and that's it just wasn't correct\nI Know I wasn't going to make a big deal about the the minor trivial errors in the film because as general they tried very hard to get the facts right but there are so focused on the facts that complete\n... let's go to the ...\nThe errors in the film because as general they tried very hard to get the facts right but there are so focused on the facts that\nComplete ... let's go to the

was an up until now has been seated zero by NASA and stay sex\nIn most of its biggest accomplishments um built it themselves the NASA gave them support later in the game so I don't agree with you\nBob there with the money from NASA can we just leave it alone all ride commercial and I have to talk about what I wanted well now that the star and ... has a Falcon Heavy contract from home\nUm they got it from a Swedish commercial company that wants to build a geosynchronous communication satellites this is one of now looks like six different contracts on that Falcon Heavy um they're building up of manifest this rocket right now this launch is going to be\nIn twenty twenty if all goes well\nWhat's really significant about this is that they they have they have almost as many books flights now as the proton has and they have more commercial flights\nMaybe than the apple is fine with the Falcon Heavy this is a big deal because they're proving that this rocket is beginning to develop accustomed to pace now obviously they've got to do some more launches I think once that happens in the ... the they realized this is a reliable rocket\nThey're going to see more signed contracts come in and that's a big deal SpaceX here is demonstrating that they're\nVery inexpensive heavy lift rocket ... bringing business\nTax also has looking to test is faring drop now remind just what a faring is\nFaring is the\nCover they put over the payloads on any launch yeah in other words just to protect the space that the pay load when it's going through the atmosphere and is exerted is faced with the greatest a dynamic range of pressures\nOr they get rid of the faring once they're above the atmosphere because they don't need it anymore and the general you know to shield so\nMost companies just let him drop the ocean and at the end of it was basic says you know we still several million dollars building those if we can recover and we can save money and so they've been on an unending test ... program trying to get them back\nAnd they've been trying to get them back during launches and they haven't succeeded they have a space ship called Mr Stephens that goes out and actually tries to\nPosition itself below the fair and it's it's coming down on a pair of cell and hasn't succeeded yet so they're actually now doing helicopter dropped tests with a ferry and they go up to eleven thousand feet above ... even and then they simulate a long time they let it go and it comes down our power cell and the ship attempts to get underneath and catch it\nUm they also have another plane that ... that follows the paring down and take video film and so I'm\nNow that it's unclear from the article I linked\nTo whether they've had any success in these catching attempt\nBut it's very clear

to lose your place in situations like this is simply unemployable you rely on your old vocal filler standbys\nI'm a former maybe you're just hesitate and stopped talking altogether\nThese are what Michael er roared calls verbal blunders and just fluency\nOr aren't was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives showy investigator done laid out his findings in his book home slips stumbles and verbal blunders and what they mean\nOne thing he found out is that we all stumble though some of us are better able to semester than others\nAre certainly people who you know when they say these things some of them do it well they make a ton natural and they use to fill the pause as a kind of punctuation and I've heard announcers on television do this quite a bit\nAnd there are other people of course who said between every single word and that really annoys me but I quit admired the first instance I don't know that I\nAm quite good enough [laughter] as a speaker to be able to do it I don't know if it's deliberately maybe that's just a matter of style but it is true that everyone does have their own baseline level of this fluency\nDoes fluency is the name for hesitations like oh man oh to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech there aren't says you have to know how we talk what's going on when our brain and our mouth worked together it might surprise you to learn good we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking is\nThat were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group of smaller or larger units and there's a basic architecture to those phrases and to those causes that we sat in our minds first\nAnd then we go and we select the words to fit in the architecture and then we associate the sounds with those words so it's kind of a linear process yeah one thing that happened that are nothing happened then the other thing happen\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrases\nThose words so it's kind of a linear process yeah one thing that happened that another thing happening in the other thing happen\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrases and clauses than we say they're simple enough but ... says it sometimes things get a little jammed up on the assembly line of our spontaneous conversations\nNow in the process of planning what to say we can't speak at the same time we're most of us find it very difficult to do both of those things simultaneously\nAnd so we plan and then we think and then we plan and then we think in very fast cycles fractions of seconds but still they're cycle\nAnd we're kind of moving back and forth between planning what to say and then actually saying it and so the other phenomena are these moments where we are alternating between planning and speaking or maybe wherever you get stuck\nIn a planning phase and so we fall silent\nMaybe or we decide to fill the silence with a little sound sometimes it's an a or an um sometimes it's a word like you know or well\nThe problems will buy some time and I know where the listener that we are done talking so please don't interrupt it also gives our audience a little insight into our mind is working speaking of insight there's another verbal mistake that's been touted as an unconscious look into the deepest recesses of our mind ... slip\nYou could describe what the flip it and say well these two sounds\nSwapped with each other or you selected the wrong word and you asked for\nSay a condom and sort of a condiment before the in part of it is where you come in and you say why did the person make that flip\nWith that word when it seemed to produce some kind of meaning that we can interpret as having some sexual innuendo behind it or having something slightly salacious or obscene or having something slightly hostile\nThen there is the ... properties are\nBeing used book or ride offer some examples saying equivocal when you meant to say equivalent or Tim Marines instead of trampolines\nWhen we hear people make verbal ... or use a lot of ... and ... there's a tendency to think they're not very smart or that they're hiding something from us around and says the evidence points to something else\nSeems pretty natural to want to come to a pretty broad sweeping conclusions about somebody based on the way that they're speaking are they lying can I trust them or they smart enough to do the job that I've asked them to do and things like that in all of the reading that I did which involved\nA pretty massive search through the literature in which there's an attempt to try to link this fluency and slipping behavior with certain kinds of personality traits\nWith pie cues with education level with all the things there's no reliable link between them so what I conclude is\nThat the fluency particularly is a pretty good indicator of state\nSo someone state of mind someone's emotional state they're not very reliable indicators of traits intelligence character leadership a tendency to lie for instance\nAnd to use the flu and fees in that way really starts to border on a kind of linguistic discrimination where you come to conclusions about who someone is essentially based on the way that they speak\nIn our segment on viewpoints we usually ... about all the homes are long pauses and six

what they think of his speech so here he is continuing his thoughts on the perception of truthfulness and verbal slips and fluency first the edited version\nThe notion of what is considered truthful

red Sox won last time of year you were born when the red Sox one of the time before that was the year and that was born and then when the red Sox won the year before that was the ... was born so we're not going to have any more babies at our house\n\nOkay but hopefully we'll have more Red Sox championship okay you know it sounds like a day that is there then again while yes there is should we watch it well yes I thought of that\nProbably like a man oh man we should both be in bed at that time\nYeah\nMaybe that's probably a good idea to be the wise thing to do young man\n\nWhen I first met my husband we went to a ... hour concert and he he knew if I Want and we go to the concert and she's seen the end the towards the end of the shows you start seeing\nAmong of Alabama huh and had me definitely during adores dogs [laughter]\nAnd I say the door [laughter]\nWe own [noise]\nPermits uncovered Ashville about his family and to help learn Boston that can make you sell Ashville Massachusetts Ron ruined it hurts the moon over ... this\nIs a brass cabaret it's all text by ... music ... and I ... and the music is just as relevant today as it wasn't Nineteen thirties unfortunately listeners of my radio station\nHere heard bio and they're thinking of maybe about a contemporary musician who is not selling his name with a W but with the Wii which I think it's a kind of really at play on words\nBut if you're not familiar with Brecht and vile who are they in why are they important in the theater cannon\nSo probably the song everybody of course violent wreck the the people know is American\nNot\nBut we know it and they're very they cover the doors song and while the\nJews and\nSo we know it through pop culture but we don't really know where this music comes from ... this music comes from a very deep politically engaged artistic practice in the Nineteen twenties and thirties it got violent Brecht and there are other collaborators driven out\nOf Germany the Nazis rose to power ironically as we talk about it on our show they ended up in Hollywood fishes out of water Brecht ended up testifying before the\nHouse un American activities committee and quickly leaving the country this country because he was so afraid of what was going on here and there were reflect all of that reflects the rise to power of the Nazis prior to World War two anti Semitism racism or sexism all kinds of things that are very relevant today\nWhen we come to see this at the shape theater this weekend is is a narrative story arc that will fall or does it feel like a a cabaret rather\nBoth I guess we made a fabric it doesn't come to show is it just you know it's funny it's sad it's terrific is sexy and et cetera\nThat was very effective joy to watch that what are some of the songs that resonate particularly\nWith you now in twenty eight and I'm not going to assume any sort of political persuasion with you but I I happen to be anti fascist\nUh and and if music can help us like that I think that's a good thing is there any like particular song particular why is that when you hear them you feel emboldened in twenty Eighteen to sort of stand up to that house on American McCarthy is kind of ideal or the Nazi fascists thing\nProbably all of them [laughter] really every single song is somehow pointed at us there if I Know that we have our song definitely but on abortion song of sexual dependency is yet yeah that'd be lined scenes Jewish\nWife in large standards are all about having to leave Germany being forced out a lot of similarities to today's world here where there's so much anti immigration in so many parts of the world and putting our country and when\nWe were rehearsing the song about Bernie Sanders which is a song about anti Semitism very explicit Anton sandwiches and there's a verse toward the end where we're seeing thousands go down in line the streets\nAnd ... this summer I just thought wow this is Charlotte so this is what this is about so immediate suddenly for a ride in the rehearsal process you revive this compilation of the brain is constantly when did you do it originally was many years ago with all the same player\nThey look a little different but not unfortunately there's such a different feeling especially in this country and also all over Europe where there is such a fear of the stranger but\nPersonally we have changed we've had children so the son of the German mother for example is killer the anger that it's just like we all lived through the anger against the month which is a song that has to do with retaliation\nHigh ridge any often feels like the ultimate fantasy from the me too movement is how I'm going to get back at all these men\nWho went over dark last friday at the Shea trees falling\nAnd you play the piano you don't see much of a\nNew York [laughter]\nFor the phone and you're playing the piano you don't see much of a [laughter]\nOn river loving drivers there we go out and David Rohde good Ben\nClark fruit farmers from cartel through farm in big red Sox fan or you just wake you up is later than you're usually waking\nUp oh no no no no the deal that was did you uh did you stay up for the whole game\nNoted that old ended on a state of the I did I did get to the weekly uh there's a couple innings and the yeah the divers was amazing yeah close to him and it was ... I was looking through earlier places just bought a\nNine strike out this is his first postseason when of this nature but you know he's they had a lot of criticism from Boston fans of our money is making him how poorly he's performed but how in consistently maybe he's performed\nIt's been such a disturbing\nHarmful I Can't use the word I Want to use it's been a mess and and now the Trump Administration is considering\nI'm rolling it out again so the public outcry while really overwhelming at times and it seemed to be the reason why the executive order signed it didn't seem enough to stop the Trump Administration from continuing this policy\nWill part of what informative reporting like yours does demonstrate\nContinuity and this juncture in immigration policies and practices it's not about Obama versus Trump or Democrats versus Republicans you know it's it's you know do we want to humane welcoming society and how do we go towards that or do we want a racist native as one you know things have\nHappened before and still be worse now and that seems very important to to underscore and to make sense of\nIf nothing else would I Hope that my reporting does is it makes it clear and I'm really unapologetic and my stance on this as a journalist I think we're\nTold that we're supposed to be unbiased but I can show you faction evidence to show you that the U.S immigration system is inherently abusive and violent and racist and so what you're saying is the products of just being wielded by a different administration that is more overtly\nAnti immigrant and more comfortable being overtly racist but that is always nice starting point and doing immigration reporting it doesn't matter who is in the White House that's that's the starting point that the tension is inhumane and violent and so is the immigration system\nWell when I was talking about letting immigrants action set the dynamic of the story rather than\nThe u._s. government announced this policy here's some quotes from immigrants in response I was thinking about recent pieces of yours one that ran on rewire dot news and and why our New York review of books daily that was headlined abolish ice beyond a slogan I failed at a very\nEncouraging story and just to the point that you've just made its reporting it doesn't change over into some other category of thing it's just reporting that has different actors at the center of it and it's really important we shift so I think our understanding of\nThe situation I Wonder if you could tell us a little bit about reporting that story on abolish ice and and what's coming through there\nSomething that I'm thinking about more and more there's a clear undocumented poet named you'll see my re as she's been doing like a speaking tour called an ... joy\nAnd he talks a lot about how um we only want to show the tragedy that is\nWhat's happening tenet grants or how hard it is to be an immigrant with no real examples of how immigrants everyday don't just survive and thrive that have full and fulfilling lives and so that can't be at the center of all of the reporting I Do as an immigration reporter but it's something that I've been thinking about and that's been laying on me and so\nThis abolish ice piece changed forum in its reporting initially it was going to be sort of an overview of like how elected officials are signing on or signing off of the movement to abolish ice\nThat just didn't feel right didn't feel good and it it didn't reflect the interviews that I was doing was important to me that\nThe peas showed the resilience of immigrant community says the movement to abolish ice is led by immigrants undocumented immigrants and specifically brown and black queer and trans immigrants they are on the front lines as they happen and\nTo abolish ice is led by immigrants undocumented immigrants and specifically brown and black clear and ... and the grants they are on the front lines as they happen and many movements and it was important to me to to highlight that showcase their resilience in ways that they're fighting back and then also to sort of\nUplift the voices of people who\nDon't have a lot of options that are still fighting back by leash showcased ... is a pastor in North Carolina has been in sanctuary for over a year\nOr less a private bills introduced in his name he can't remain in the last and he stuck in a church and people like ... who was deported under the Obama administration facing a ten year bar and she's coming up on nine years and she's terrified to come back to the United states because it's\nAn even scarier place and then she was first deported so there's you know different immigrant communities have different\nRealities in the experiences and I want to highlight those as much as possible and make them the story in the center of the story\nAnd when you do that things fall allowed on such different lines then throughout much of reporting that the people that you talk to\nDon't split their issue where their lives into you know the families versus fell in the whole good versus bad ... framework that the date pushes and the media too often echo they just that's not how they see things that all they have a different view of it\nYeah there there's certainly no clear cut lines and the example of felons not families is really striking to me that's something that President Obama said he says that you know where where he deporting felons not families or where that is who are targeting but\nYou know if you are deported in the United states and you come back to China reunite with your family your eye cell and that is a felony so you are both say a father\nOr mother or a family member and now you are asked how in in the eyes of the United states so the immigration system is is messy and it's complicated and like tidy narratives don't serve anybody\nWe've been speaking with Tina ... senior immigration reporter at rewired dot news thank you so much for joining us this week on counter stand\nThank you for having me [noise]\n\n\nWhat is clear is that the Trump White house wants what it wants decades of carefully forged law and tradition be damned one of the things at once as the eradication of public expressions of dissent\nDonald Trump has said that protest against him and his friends should be illegal that those who engage in it should lose their jobs and or have violence visited upon them\nIf the White House can achieve that will they'll get as close to it as they can which brings us to the latest the national Park Service under interior secretary Ryan Zinke heat seeking to rewrite the rules on free speech and demonstrations\nOn those public lands that are under federal jurisdiction in Washington DC\nThat would be the parks sidewalks and streets and the country's capital but I've seen some of the most significant public protests in us history\nWe're joined now for understanding of this latest assault on the first amendment and how we push back by ... executive director of the partnership for civil justice fond she joins us now by phone from Washington DC welcome back to counter spend more overhead and he'll yard\nSo glad to be with you well tell us about the proposed new rules from the national Park Service and what they would actually means\nThem national park service under secretary Zinke he under the Trump Administration has put out the most substantial overhaul of the regulations governing access to public lands in Washington DC for demonstrations\nWe believe in the history of the Park Service we've never seen this\nMassive regulatory rewrite at one time and these are rules that have been forged incrementally over five decades of constitutional rights litigation one time and again\nThe park services and brought before a federal court where activists have had to fight to be able to demonstrate in Washington DC and these rules were put into place really took guy the hand of the Park Service so that\nWe would be able to exercise or free speech rights without them being able to take actions to disrupt the burden that exercise what they're trying to do is throw all of that out the window and\nJust so that people have an understanding of the scope of this we're talking about all of the most sort of iconic locations when you think about the history of protests in the United states we're talking about the national mall the Lincoln Memorial the White House sidewalk Lafayette Park\nThe Washington Monument grounds the sidewalks up and down Pennsylvania Avenue including in front of the Trump Hotel\nWhat they have proposed it's more than fourteen points rulemaking but just to highlight some of\nThe key provisions that are so damaging\nThey have put out a proposal that we've called the protest tax where they're asking the public for they had asked for comment on whether or not people that want to demonstrate on these public lands in Washington DC should be charged for doing so and those charges could include anything from\nThe barricades and fencing that are set up at the discretion of the police so you know they're going to Penn un and charge you for it\nThat could include the salaries and overtime of park officials\nWho come out to monitor demonstrations it could include invoices send after the fact two demonstrators demonstration organizers for claimed harm to the grass\nThat people stood upon an assembly to demonstrate these charges could\nMount in the not just the thousands but tens of thousands and in fact the hundreds of thousands of dollars so worth it to succeed it would make demonstrations just you know Bradley expensive and were threatened to bankrupt grassroots organizations and that's just one of the proposals\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWhat do you raise your review somebody more as I said [noise]\nNobody rage him it's\n[noise] the following\nIs a paid commercial announcement and the opinions express or not necessarily those have WHM pre itself or management any claims made during the program are those the advertiser and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of WHM pretty [noise]\nMorning and wasn't ready set time ... along with my husband

little bit of the background on sugar Bush instead of what the brand is about\nSure route is sugar buzz shah was launched in two thousand sixteen um we had started with us seven different yarns what we have we're a Canadian company so we know the cold up here are tied\nWe had started with seven different yarns what do we have we're a Canadian company so we know the cold up here are tied line began we turn cold into cool [laughter] so we're very used to the cold weather and knitting to conform with that weather so we had wanted to offer 'em\nA luxury liner ... across North America we actually attended a few ... have you ... shows prior to our launch and met with a small ... suppliers in Italy so we do importer yarn from a very small your\nMeals or cross um Europe and in South America\nSo what we have done is we've grown from seven yards and now in our second year we're up to Fifteen different yarns that we do offer\nThat's offered that's awesome and what can you know what would you look for any on what the sugar should've Bush brand profile\nWell of course warm that's one of the major things that we do look for so we we tend to to\nBe attracted to them more will products we look for an all natural I'll read don't carry 'em too much synthetic fibers and our yarns um all of them are made from either will end and blend all we do have some hot and the lenses while that we have brought into the line and ah\nSpring in two thousand Seventeen so it's mainly just the natural lens and the more luxury is worth the extra fine marina else that we do carry\nAnd you know you also have um really strong designed support to when when you go to work on a collection what are some of the things that are important um from your perspective from in a design perspective\nSure well sugar Bush or a very small team we do not have in the house designers what we do is we put a call for the missions out and we've been very privileged to work with some of\nWonderful designers all we do put together a of\nA guide with our collection and what we're requested this the and we put it out to the experts who are the designers we've worked with um a less elite men and Patty lions\nWe just had one of our designs are in Oregon designed featured in one of the magazines and we're really excited to be working with a movement are make her life they featured some sugar Bush yarn designs in their book\nOh that is done it's very cool um you know it was interesting when we were as prepping for the show yesterday and I had um one of the women on my marketing team helping me\nUm you know pull yarn and pull the designed and kind of go through your your um your pattern collection that were carrying and pick out a couple of specific ones and it was really interesting 'cause she came in to me and said\nShe just designed are so nice she was she goes I really haven't paid too much attention to this brand yet you know it just came in recently she said but I really love the design she said everything's very nibble and wearable\nAnd she said but yet but it's still sort of\nYou know fashion without being you know trendy\nRight well what we like to do is you know our small came here we we picked yarn and then way we want the yarn to speak to the designers and that's why we really appreciate you know their input as well to see what they are thinking when they touch and feel our yarns and of course\nYou know we bring in the ... aspect to it where you know\nWe wear wool sweaters and in fact today it is starting to snow it's our first snow day here in southwestern Ontario so we're getting that white stuff so we like to have designs that keep the warmth are trendy we are on top of the uh different trends in the marketplace so\nWe we want to be I have something available that wearable and trend is well\nNow let's talk about the ... that we launched with the first one is chill why don't you share with our listeners what she'll is all about\nChili is are are one hundred percent extra find Marino it is a Super Bowl ... wait and has been doing fantastic we find a lot of our our leaders are making I don't want her to ball projects from headband to Paulos who's scarves\nAnd upwards of different designs that are out there we had um a design in vogue knitting with a Scandinavian ... sweater which is fantastic so it is very warm it's not that\nFull heavy feeling up a wall because it is very extra fine and it is very far\nRight and it's and it's also lighten lofty because it's a roving\nI'm as it's known applied yarn and that makes it would be different especially when you're eating at a gauge of one and a half to two and three quarter inches up on an eleven anywhere from an eleven to Seventeen you know if this was applied yarn 'em and constructed differently this could you could really weigh you down but because of the way you chose to do the construction it's it really works out well\nSugar grocery talk knows in their ... or ...\nOr a tech knows in their will stocks in there and I'm not sure what the other one is sort of Marino I think um and so\nYou for a hundred and twenty seven twenty you get for there's four different color ways um you get enough to actually to towels or to wraps um and and the pattern and everything together and as soon as four different colors it's gonna be in our holiday catalogue as well I Believe\nRight and I think this kid is great because you do have a nephew on to do two of these rap so um you know with the pitch to get right there you need to have to gifts or one that you can make for yourself and one that you can make is if you have to sell it it really works out well\nRight and it's a hundred and twenty seven twenty it's actually automatically discount about twenty five percent so it's really Ninety five dollars right for two for two projects\nRight some really really beautiful um range of a yard signs from our friendship lose fat a fibers\nYes it's really great

do exceedingly well um I Love having their product or in the store\nYes so Seventy two dollars a there's two different color ways of this one is um ... and ... um and I think there's a pink and brown option as well I'm\nMore of a gray and had a little bit of a godsend right it did it turn the patrons that ... you didn't know it doesn't turn it lilac and it makes it look like yeah I mean it's it's

they kind of ... because they streamed side by side it's not this it's not a match messy\nAnd it's not matching match either right and this is an exit another example and I love it when these kind of line and acrylic I'm having a reason to exist and not just you know to be a crappy on\nThis acrylic is doing its job in being shiny in enhancing the roving and he didn't end up with a beautiful beautiful fabric made out of this and it's going to be equipment to get even it's a gauge um\n[noise] it's it's a um super excited to pick his\nMistress and we have um a needed ups of each color right

issues with\nGood morning within\nThe next being with us chip and tell us how big is the palm oil problem and what are the biggest issues with the process and scale of its production\nWell I'm the palm oil trades is native to a tropical West Africa and it's\nBeen around and used by people for probably five thousand years I think they found traces of it in some of the um ... um [noise] but it seems as really skyrocketed and about the last three decades it's um about a sixty foot tall spiky tree as a palm tree as\nBig a bunches of fruits which I'm going to be squeezed here or out of both the free part of the\nInside is a a a palm kernel [noise] um it's uh most of it these days come from Malaysia and Indonesia and Southeast Asia which it's ideal habitat and really invested in it um [noise]\nIt's a the areas that is under cultivation has probably tripled I'm too hard to calculate those big producers in small things but probably tripled as hard as soon as I can tell Eighteen to twenty million Hector is\nWhich is a lot um is now they're in a [noise] mainly in Southeast Asia there's uh it's it's making inroads is crawling other places where the wild in the tropics in central in West Africa and parts of Latin America [noise]\nThe problems that cause it's a very useful thing obviously as you mentioned that can be used for many things productive crop um apartments where you plant it and um it\nDoes best in in large plantations when you're producing for commercial purposes um which can be sat around a processing\nFacility the fruits only last about two to three days after it's been got to get processed in oil um so long and short of it is is a vast areas of tropical rain forest has been cleared off in the way they care that much to\nTake out some ... ... and then it gets burned 'em\nAnd planted in these these these massive clear cut plantations um a lot of the area and Indonesia is what's been cleared is Pete swamps tropical Pete slumps which has caused huge problems with um people may have heard of wood fired in have obviously a huge\nHere to um emissions that is that climate change 'em and this has been a major major issue in Indonesia and for some of its neighbors as they have just moved into the marine corps and other places so those are some of the big\nProblems that we see um [noise] in a ... as as it as it has has developed it's not about the plant itself the plant is just a palm tree it's way planted them and and how you planted\nAnd planted a as you say mostly in Malaysia and Indonesia what if anything are those countries trying to do to combat the palm oil problem are they doing anything\nWhile there's been a yes their head they they have certainly been some efforts has been a lot of public pressure some of the big corporations who are the consumers that this uh [noise] the the ultimate that what they call the consumer facing companies like Unilever and ... and others\nHave yourselves been pressured and put pressure on their supplies and the governments have reacted to some degree there have been zero burning policy was put in place or the moratoriums new bands I'm\nClearing a pristine tropical rain forest area is um for the planting a palm oil or anything else on it's not just palm oil what's the problem some countries in the region the hot rubber and other things but it was the largest to these\nSo called forest risk industrial agriculture cops so there's been some efforts and there's been some improvements but it's still quite a big problem in what people worry about now is some of these major companies from that part of the world\nHas started to look at investments in the Congo basin in Africa in Peru and other parts of the world and there's a a lot of concern that um the way that they\nHad it develops in Latin America and Africa not follow this very distracted Catholics has caused all these problems for fire diversity\nClimate change in Southeast Asia it's worth mentioning that in one study a that was done when you go from Christine tropical rainforests to a one species of cultural plantation of palm oil um only about Fifteen Percent of the species\nCan actually continue to inhabit that area so it's very bad to their to their city birds can move around a bit better than ... contends perhaps and tigers and things like that but they definitely get affected and uh [noise] so it's not only a big problem in terms of air pollution\nAnd and the climate change side but also for the habitats of of animals and in Southeast Asia and lo and tropical rain forest or some of the most diverse areas in the world so it's definitely a concern from that perspective\nThere appears to be an ironic circumstance maybe now above the attempt to get rid of trans fats in our diets for health purposes or maybe the driver or to even for the increase the use of palm oil is it a big factor [noise]\nAh it's certainly a factor I don't know if it's a big factor they push away from trans fats and towards more healthy oils in food I'm certainly inside and an impact on that there are some sophistication and so I'm I'm no expert on this but I Know that uh\nIn in terms of the bad dietary consequences something like coconut oil as it is worse than a mile and um you know so that it's been one factor but they've been a lot of things which have been pushing the cheap and it's easy to produce um\nAnd ah there's there is in\nThere and it's gone up and down with the you know sometimes the prices high sometimes as\nOlder production and you've seen efforts and Indonesia to\nPut a mandate to increase the use of palm oil in bio diesel so basically mixing it in um like we do in the United states with ethanol to make fuels I'm certainly it's used in a whole variety of of products asserting Indonesia is an exporter of its its use them as the main oil you know\nPeople using the kitchen [noise] um so there's a whole lot of different demands for it in different ways as he mentioned Jason cosmetics and so in a whole range of things um and so it's a it's just a high healthy demand for it in the world and it's one of the most productive per acre crops that there is in terms of vegetable oil\nTo bring the problem down to ground liberated the grocery store chip what good's consumers do anything about buying products that inevitably contain palm oil is are way too many labeling that we should look for\nIt's not labeled very well in some cases that will just say ... oils with things like that I think there's two things that has been an effort as it goes a group or we became together what industry and environmentalists and all called the roundtable on sustainable palm oil\nAnd they have a label um which you can find some times I found that the other day on Amazon dot com if you look ... certified palm oil you can buy it right there on line [noise] um and\nThey said is a certain set of standards on not having impacts on high on traditional value for us not clearing rain forest and there's and and auditing process so that is getting going um extent to which you will find that in the blended product psychic his dinner like soap and things like that\nIt's very difficult and there's always that that effort to you just say to her I don't want to buy anything that has palm oil in it or do you\nSoak and things like ... it's pretty difficult and there's always that that ethic

[laughter] but\nSo you're I mean you asking the question like is the government like you know are they back like what's going on why are they paying attention and I went to talk yesterday with that um indigenous women and about like basically the the laws that\nDid you know swimming and about like basically\nThe the laws that have been in place for years and years that are trying to destroy and replace the indigenous people in the United states and I think that in some ways that's true of every ... every non white human I'm across the board there's this like um [noise]\nI I you know I don't know if it's an intention sometimes it is sometimes it's not but it does seem like\nThe policies that we enact as a country or\nAbout destroying\nOK talking to the microphones are yeah yeah there's one pointed to the microphone I was like yeah 'cause then use your voice kind of drift off a huh cool I'll just raise the volume\nYeah yeah if you're given Bijan is ... do you think\nWhat do you think of the hold a ... dust up with Elizabeth Warren ... doing her DNA having a DNA tests are so that you could say look I Do have indigenous but my feeling is that you should not have done ... any more than Obama should not have shown his birth certificate it's like when people\nAre being stupid to you\nIs I don't validate the stupidity as like oh let me just like prove this to you know they're stupid they think the world is flat so what are you going to do and I come to them you know look at this globe because it's you know\nYeah because the pictures at the top of the earth from the moon what do you think\nYeah it's kind of annoying that she did it 'cause I mean in some ways like people who don't want to believe for who just that they can use it they can still pick at it 'cause it's like you know this and this far do you know relative and it wasn't\nLike I don't I'm not I don't have strong opinions about it I guess but\nI think the only person who made a great case was Bill Maher when Bill Maher [laughter]\n[noise] if the\nUs Donald Trump ... you need to prove that your father was not on a regular time [laughter] and I have an awesome [laughter] if you can prove that I'll give you a million dollars\nA Donald Trump showed him you know he publishes birth certificate as if he had to this\nVery clearly he his father's not on a rank time was that Bill Maher said that his mother with human and his father was orangutan\n[laughter] I'm doing some fun with it you know so it's like you're saying that Elizabeth Warren like doing the same thing\nWell no not as you're saying that maybe I Am saying [laughter] what's with all this like\nI got to prove to you who I Am\nWhen it's just ridiculous the the accusation to begin with is ridiculous the the the ... the criticism is ridiculous to begin with so you know everybody's like oh I got I got it from my birth certificates I can show you that\nYou know my father is not an around your time where I got to get my DNA so I can tell you that my whoever it was way in the back which is you know neither here nor there for me mhm if there was an indigenous\nRight and now she's going through this for this fire of some indigenous people saying well where where are you at Standing Rock right was your people you know it's like I tell you the left is always criticizing the left\n... is just\n... you can never win as a liberal in this country or maybe in any country mhm you always fall short of something you always\nDisappoint as a huge segment within criticized and I think that's what's happening yeah with Elizabeth Warren is just like they're just jumping on her and how she asked me or should I Do this DNA thing and release it no absolutely not and don't even think\nAbout that at the end if anybody asks you know next question yeah I I just don't answer ridiculous notions\nYou know we're in deep trouble in this country we need to concentrate on how do we lift people out of poverty we need to ... how do we get those

just hear how wouldn't why they started how and why they grew how and why they changed\nAnd um basically what it feels like to be your own boss and today I'm Glad to have\nA Brenda in Glen or suck\nI knew Brenda because one of the partners of the family business center is Mario Brothers collector where she is the head of operations in development\nSo nice to have you here thank thank you very much and then you are in also in business with your husband Glen list I remember hearing one morning and thank you for the invitation and the and the businesses graduate pests solutions correct\nSo and this is a the pests have graduated from what to what\nAm I live on that you know you got to be as they've just always\nBeen here and there always will be\nRecorded for caterpillar probably I Would never have a butterfly\n[laughter] now if I had one of those\nSo let's just go back to the root and how did you become this I I had mentioned to you that I've given talks a couple of times to the pest control technology conference and it is a certain kind of person who decides to become an entomologist\nYeah absolutely and I actually I came in kind of through the fault I'm Brennan I have known each other since high school students who are Fifteen\nAnd her father needed some slave labor for cross country trip because he was a schoolteacher uh-huh\nI got into this because I volunteered to be a driver for him and we went to a bunch of national parks out west and with a lot of camping so without going into a lot of detail I at that point decided I wanted to go into forestry uh-huh\nDuring the course of my education I had as we all usually do have some mentors someone within the\nEducational framework that will give you some sage advice right and I had a professor who didn't want to squash my forestry dream and if you study bugs in rodents she'll always be employed so good at that point when I graduated look at her job Brennan I decided to get married\nUm and I realized that if I Want to be gainfully employed to go into the pest control industry and just kind of fell into it so that's the precipitous rise of this and then going through the careers us raising our children at a certain point we said you know what we could do this you know in ten years ago\nWe did you ever worked for a larger company before you many or did your own\nYes uh-huh exactly and actually in Chicago 'cause it's a time when I graduated from Syracuse um she was living and had a career in Chicago so I wound up moving out there we got married and I took a job out there and I learned from a very good company\nWith commercial pest control was like uh-huh I also learned that classroom training about bugs and rodents is not necessarily\nA move well into the business environment technical knowledge is one part people skills is a much\nBigger right now right out of being in ... so we don't know each other well but uh the thing that surprised me and doing a couple of these conferences in is how much people in the pest control business love pass [laughter] uh well you usually have that's\nYour initial love my mom used to I don't know why but I I've always loved the outdoors and\nMy mom would get upset with me when I have frozen grasshoppers and had a magnifying glass and was and I don't know I was I had a fascination with bugs and uh and just being in the outdoors so we we just get into that\nAnd you have a lot of people in our industry that a lot of technical knowledge the ones that are really grow into the bigger companies are are the ones that reach as I'm saying beyond the technical stuff but we'll get together we kind of default to that uh-huh that are beating up on each other or you know it and and have conversations about\nWhat's working for you to take care of bedbugs will do for you to get rid of the answers this work and in because you go is is you know it's a trade show ya\nYou got the exhibit hall and they everybody's got the next best thing that they just wipe them out for it\nThe answer is this working in because you go is is you know it's a trade show ya you got the exhibit hall and they everybody's got the next best thing that right and I just wipe them out\nFor ... and you're not allowed to kill them pass but you need to be careful of what you're doing to the people at correct yeah oh yeah\n... that I just sort of follow up on your your comment because you're a hundred percent right\nThe thing that I have always been so impressed with and love England is his passion his passion for the work that he does and you wouldn't necessarily think of that for pest control mhm yet he he he loves the ... he left the service\nAnd he just brings that ... I'm attracted right\nYeah you know our our our industry just to give the big picture since you've spoken\nTo a lot of people a lotta a lotta people look at us as an individual's urine\nThey don't call me uh-huh uh but I Do go on to these calls where I where people have been trying that and they get overwhelmed with the cock roaches are and they finally say I need to call a professional\nSo there's something to it because it's been\nPassed down for you know many years I haven't seen any home remedies myself ha ha there were an absolute horror on a lot of times that you catch it early and you can solve problems um sometimes it coincides with maybe something else that's\nGoing on you know the whatever the ... came in on right got taken out and\nSo you know sometimes like ... actually I just use have a heart traps and the killer traps and I I liked the killer traps better because if I didn't catch the have a hard it's been starving in there and ...\nI think my third one yeah ever gets less cruel yeah if you will simply be quick\nYeah yeah so I'm I'm just wondering how many mice are in my house there were three of their hundreds\nUm it gets it's hard to tell because it because as you look around and we all know the little yeah things they leave a around right I mean\nThey leave those things stick around for a long time so you may be looking around I'll go in and do an inspection for somebody and see a lot of droppings but when I actually set traps and put poisons out\nA catch one or two in the problems over us they've just been sitting there for so this is the only way to tell us to to run some traps and poison and see what results you get yeah and and then I go from there so\nDo you normally get called in after I Would imagine house in business you do both correct so so business probably is more diligent because there's just you don't want my running around your restaurant correct but but you get called into a house more often if somebody's ride it or are you the\n... there was no there there are folks that hire us for seasonal agreement\nAnd come in we call it I grabbed care agreement and we come to the home three times\nDuring the course of the season for lack in his or her lacked yeah you know but that's usually the person who's tired of dealing with it right who lives in the woods\nA wooded area or an area that just as prone to a lot of wrote an activity and or aunt activity you know if if if we come to your home and get inside of your wall those folks usually have us do preventative service for the following\nYears on hold for a long period of time so I'm home alone as many homeowners are pretty proactive with this because they've seen the damage that the ants do other termites to do or that the mice I mean you have fires from from mice chewing on wires yeah things like that\nOr I had that once we we are still are electric stove Roque and when he took the part of the matter is it looked like it was cartoon\nYeah fitness wired and it was like all stress is just not funny but some of the funniest experiences I've had or with\nWith the the the wife if you will yeah it's a it's one of the husband to do something about Eisen is with the and then so when I show up I'm usually dealing with the husband who's out there and tiny as a really want to hire a C I can handle is like Indiana\nBut the biggest believers I have in having an ongoing service or the husbands who had the mice chew on their toys\nTheir car and the ... damage to that at that point I just want to make it All right how large of past do you get into\nA well this is one of the one of the things I his public service announcement here\nA lot of people think if you're the exterminator licensed clinical you also do raccoons squirrels and it's actually\nTwo different departments in Massachusetts uh-huh my license comes from the department of agriculture nuisance wildlife comes from the department of\nOr comments in Massachusetts my license comes from the department of agriculture\nNuisance wildlife comes from the department of oh ... oh so you've got two different licenses right most passes you know where you're ends right yeah I can do mice I can do rats but when you get to the bigger furry creatures you have to have a different life not for that and and we just usually refer that out to someone who has that\nIt'll probably be the company not through its own agency or not right now is town agencies won't handle right most of the you know federal ... largest skunk\nOn my front porch you haven't actually what I had was a very secure bird feed but yeah\nAnd luckily I had a little vial of Fox urine don't ask me why I had that ...\nPercent are acting out there and I perfectly aimed at and I threw the vials of it now does a little puddle of Fox urine writer and those of the sky just looked at me through the window and like what the hell are\nYou are in the world yeah he's well I'm On I'm On the street but it's been a few what did he respond appropriately he left ... yeah yeah yeah so anyway I ...\nGoing to have a skunk smell minute\nSo how does your business compete in this area it is different question than before you have other small agencies you have other large national companies um how do you just keep a toehold in the in the business and cetera\nWell actually this you might speak to 'em Glenn has a background in commercial a contact work at a very very strong deep\nA background in that so what are the things that we did do or do you want an ongoing basis as we went to commercial bed ... and going back a number of years ago\nA state of Connecticut had um you know their pesticide bed came up Glenn knows how to process those beds and on to them\nAnd we are actually the one vendor for the state of Connecticut in Hartford county you know everything from the governor's mansion to the president and everything in between that we do mhm so you know that certainly is a good way right guard in yeah\nBidding is a odd because we are small and lean we're running compete on an hourly remember learning our ongoing biz rice regular emergency room and all of those employees are potential customers get calls from then ride service work and how do you offer discounts to employees of the state or a knife or location\nAny do you have a a team of any size of people that go out and spray or you were actually on the ground doing it\nOn the moon I well I'm I'm an owner operator I mainly focused on the sales and the bids fourth and during the busy season all hands on deck for them and we have accrued three\n... guys they're just constantly are you doing that and in writing we do a lot of spraying during the season it's a lot of the IBM work that we do where we're not it's not all chemicals they integrated upright Senegal resigned as a manager yeah\nYeah so what what are the qualities of a good uh employee that they're going to\nUm good people skills uh-huh number one eagerness to learn um you're going to be coached yeah\nYou got to have a bit of this hunter as you are now to conduct a herd of if you're in yeah I mean you have to think about where are they living where if I'm any on where am I in this house if I'm a mouse where am I live and then there's\nIt's it's just a different mindset that we coached the guys on yeah and uh and then being able to deal with the customers in terms of their fears on their ... their customers especially people have bed bugs eat all kind of walk them off the ledge yes\nBecause this is just another aspect of my industry where like every industry you know if you've got a problem and you go on the Internet and research it\nAll the rest of the horror stories right an arm I we\nWe don't have bed bugs in our house but a friend was sure that we did but he was wrong right um but when we research that it's like yeah thousands of dollars for a train Beagle that can smell them or I hate the room of two hundred and forty degrees of these worth thousands of dollars on\nA lot of ... the lead Israeli developed his own approach which really includes\nResident education and it's actually very cost effective and and our customers are very satisfied and and so we those can be effective ... and I think that Clinton approach with you know ... education\nAnd correct uses of materials and uh it's it's good it's yeah well that's\nAn interesting aspect of the dogs because everybody loves the dog is um they have a niche in our industry really in the niches bedbugs hitchhikers uh-huh if you own a motel hotel uh uh one of the big um hospitality industry\nPeople coming and going there and if these things are hitchhiking your that ruined can be fined today and tomorrow somebody left the bug right if you get a dog there will run through twenty rooms at a time thirty rooms at a time and say there's no bugging their uh-huh if you're the owner of that hotel restaurant you go that's a good value I that's why I catch it early and when you catch it early\nIt's much easier to fix them when you get out of control on the extremes that you see on the Internet\nThe heat is another one if you think about it he is um [noise]\nUh [noise] excuse me heat heat is a situation where we found that apply heat when I leave and I'm done with that job and there's nothing left to kill the bugs even if they are reintroduced ... and so I rely mostly on pesticide applications that leaves a residual for you for\nThe heat was sold our industry as kind of um you know the order situation there's a lot of stuff and you can't get people to rank was though it gives you an opportunity we can just kill and it just it doesn't work\nSo you can read it up to see one or the person that words newspapers\nAnd the bugs all go hide under all all the blanket slows and write him back out when he came\nIn the first place could come again and then resident saw that\nOne doesn't solve the right always heard when you're in a hotel to just pull back especially the poster board pull it back right if his blood ... yep raping\nGod because you don't have time to explain this to you right now but yeah\nIt might seem like it's just as simple as explaining what the letter stands for but it it actually does something more justified your job all good bashful bladder or shy bladder where are you just let all of those are\nWhich means when your gun shy or the bathroom for certain people they might be gun shy when they go to try to stay in it at your own doesn't come out is that what it is an\nInability to hearing it in the presence of others

a a famous like urban legend of building the wall of cabbage and then in making Mexico pay for it maybe that stories that really for the radio\nYeah okay my mom's old neighborhood used to take a wagon and set it on fire and brought down the hill every Halloween that seems really\nSay [laughter] Arafat got bad\nI also make a recommendation that if there was a scavenger hunt on Halloween your senior

at a bar that we love to play and plug them called ...\nYou were doing a good does that are so Halloween and spooky theme songs doing some of them we've kinda been spit balling about this over the last month upstairs I Will be good Halloween sauce they're the ones you have to do there's time or been thriller or we're not doing the monster mensch because\nWe are still hoping you were going to say that but it's a great yarn bring a graveyard smashed but it hasn't done it should be pushed around they come back\nInto pasture or with the Christmas dark either or whatever that\nDominates the

by the spirit guide and Ringo\nPerfect for the cool fall weather coming up what makes\nFor good to bottom easy easy to\nFollow when you were in the work out you know when to start you know when to stop and when you are going in those intense intervals it pushes you it's like a movie do you watch a movie without any music or any soundtrack is lacking that deeper motivation and I think with us we always strive to push in those intervals and make our athletes think like I'm In a movie right now I Need to\nPush geographical and John Wayne a when a low bitch a Franklin County we no longer tore fulltime with barefoot through what they do now is make exercise music reform called the ... are you doing original the bottom music are you using coverage and can you\nMonetize that if you decide you're going to use a cover song because I'm assuming that this is your like full time gig now the barefoot truth occasionally surfaces on friday the Academy of music but most of the time this is what you're doing right\nYeah so it started as original music but then a few years now and we thought maybe we should take a a a chance of some ... some covers a so one of our favorite ones is rocky\nRocky ... right I think on the Internet and I hate exercising\nAnd even when that comes on the sides of the steak on my way to see how many\nLike YouTube views are streams of that one man that's a good question I should look at it so we have I'm sure your insistence on factual information and we have a lot better than\nAfter further research the rocky ... song has three million spends on Spotify alone they get one point two million streams per month on Spotify one point two five million views on YouTube per month over fifty million YouTube views total and over two hundred thousand YouTube

they were doing the seven minute workout\nWhich is another like Internet sensation\nAre you doing minute work out and we now have a story\nFor you were always getting people emailing us asking us do like other specific workout times uh-huh what was the biggest requests we had from our listeners the seven minute workout rocky version\n[noise] this\nStarted as an idea in a kitchen and for both Jay night we've taken that skill set of what is taking a grown to about it and just gross so now we're in a full studio we have people do certain things that we know they'll do a better rate count down right you know we're really lucky to\nHave found this little niche that allows us to take what we love to do which is essentially make music and connect with people\nPart of the reason that barefoot troops stopped touring as intently and does these kind of shows like this Friday at the Academy of music of one off shows in the area where you guys are from is because of the relentless instead the Turing schedule if I remember correctly and in this the wave of the future for musicians and\nFinding a niche like that and having like an office job but still being able to create music without having to go in the ... which seems so glamorous but isn't most of the time we're hearing more and more of this growing middle\nClass in the world of musicians which didn't really exist quite as much in the past mhm sort of a niche that the Internet has provided yeah and I think\nFor artists that are just trying to provide their own music and get it out there this is the future you you can put a song now you do not need distribution as much as you needed you know back a decade ago you know you it's hard to play it showed the Academy of music and not come out of there\nSmiling and loving it and and so that's what these reunion shows are about bringing your fans back together getting the band back together in in sort of reminiscing about how the road can be great because it is awesome

may be protective against Alzheimer's disease in women\nMost Dr Pauline Mackey professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago She says other studies also show that exposure to estrogen could be a protective factor\nProbably the strongest evidence that reproductive factors play a role in all the same risk disease come from studies of women who have their ovaries

modest lead lower risk of dementia and we don't know if this is speaking to levels of exposure to certain hormones I mean there's definitely a very specific or mono mill you that only happens when one is pregnant\nIt could also be speaking to just house that women who have more children or possibly healthier we also don't know among women for example in our study who had miscarriages because we also found this association between self report of miscarriage\nAnd in elevated risk of dementia\nPeople with three or more kids have a lot of social engagement and a lot of social support that may be protective against all the time or his disease so in my mind it's not necessarily the hormonal changes that accompany\nPregnancy that might be related to a woman's risk of Alzheimer's disease later on but rather some of these lifestyle factors that go hand in hand with having children\nAnd when a woman becomes pregnant her body goes through many other changes that are visible to the ...\nIt was another researcher who had looked at number of months pregnant and had found an association between number of months pregnant and certain I masters being differential e associated\nWith dementia she hypothesize\nThat it was due to changes in the immune system what I Do know is that certainly there are changes in a woman's immune system to support her pregnancy because certainly the body does not want to see the pregnancy you know as something external rights do we want the body to accept the pregnancy\nClearly there are many factors that go into old timers risk you have to smarts affected more women suffer from little shorter than men women are not as readily identified\nIt may be harder to identify ... disease in women because the test\nThat we most frequently used to identify all scientists disease is a test that women naturally perform better on than men that's a test of what we called verbal memory it turns out that due to higher levels of estrogen women performed better\nOn this memory test compared to men women are maintaining this superior performance\nAnd so I think it actually worse than the condition of home sickness because people feel all the more alone\nIn fact we might not want to admit it Matt says home sickness is something most people experience even if you enjoy new places and experiences the lack of familiarity can still be intimidating but if you admit to being home sick then it becomes a legitimate emotion which often a listener so little sympathy\nBut I think it is remarkably common place and that lots of people if you scratch the surface will admit to longing for wherever they came from whether it's immigrants in your neighborhood or\nPeople who've relocated just across the country\nIt's visible on so many parts of our culture in terms of the food we choose to eat and the sports teams we root for war and the music we listen to heave are often trying to make that connection back to home I think is very widespread phenomenon in our culture but we don't feel like we're allowed to talk about it so\nI Wish we could talk about it more because I think people would feel less stigma if they realize lots of people in America have experienced the feeling and in fact it's kind of a normal ... meant to moving but because the brushed under the table people feel a little embarrassed by it in reality you know\nGoing back to colonial America I find records of the pilgrims being hopes that gets about as American as apple pie\nHome sickness maybe an old emotion but Dr Chris Willard a lecture on psychiatry at Harvard Medical school says social networks and new technology may make it worse\nWell I think that makes it a lot more difficult to to detach so I think it's I think that's part of what makes home sickness probably even more acute for kids these days or you know for adults to be cut kids\nI think that's part of what makes homesickness probably even more acute for\nKids these days are you know for adults to be a kind of kids that called our kids are away we're so used to being able to be attached all the time I got this kind of digital wireless I'm ... and that's that's that's ... connected\nThat our kids go off our kids we go off to cap or somewhere else and it's not easy to get in touch with people when we're so used to that\nThat the economy is much more likely to create or make a mistake that's even worse\nWill it agrees home sickness is a reasonable response to a big life change he says a helpful coping strategy is to express your feelings so people can understand\nBut I think any time we get through a difficult situation that just makes us stronger\nAnd so when one of the things that I suggest that parents there was when our kids have experienced home sickness that they really talk about it\nI'm not drive home or in during the rest of the year because it can become this kind of touchstone of how you were home sick and you've got through it you know during that two weeks time at camp\nNow that means you can get through it if you go to a longer camp that means he'll be able to get through it when you go off to college here and another strange situation or our family moves across across the state or across the country or something like that so it it does give kids confidence when they can get through something difficult\nLike the old saying you know that which does not kill us makes us stronger\nAnd I'm like that so you know an honorable that got through adversity we can start to see that as a strength and cultivate that as a strength and talk about it with our cat doesn't strength that they have so I really think you know in in that sense it's overcoming something that can be really positive\nSo while it may not be life threatening home sickness is legitimate and it can happen to just about anyone when they're away from familiar surroundings it's the result of our instinctive knee for love protection and security\nThere's no reason to feel ashamed that

farmland have so little in common when it comes to the daily grind political leanings and their views on money\nAnd working hard in this curiosity has come a boom of books about the residents of rural America the latest is my author and journalist Sharon ...\nSo I grew up on a wheat and cattle farm thirty miles west of Wichita\nAnd in some ways that I was a child in the eighties and a teenager in the nineties and by then there were some major technological shifts going on in the country but because of our socio economic station we didn't have any of those things so I didn't have air

beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had\nAnimals and nature to interact with meanwhile within the walls of our house there was all sorts of strife and dysfunction much of which had to do in my view with economic struggle and so that's part of the story too but you know I it is an experience this\nThing we call rural America

Can't say that in\nThose moments let's say as a child qualifying for\nFree school lunches or as a first generation college student and not knowing\nWhat the term in graduate school meant when someone talked about applying to graduate school not having the right clothes and so on those are things that I see now looking back that I did feel discomfort Shane embarrassment I was not necessarily conscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it that way\nBut the thing is we live in a society that is full of messages for people who struggle financially that that your value and worth is somehow tied to your financial value and worth and if that's the case in the context of capitalism that in my family and I are pretty worthless [noise]\nThat's of course the impetus for this book

imported from Canada that just needs to go back across the border\nIn Canada is common that people sign multi year obligations\nTo cell phone carriers and T Mobile but very people who did away with contracts now are experimenting with three year payment plans for cell phones\nIt's come to that because with people getting excited about the new iPhones and the new Sam songs that all price out around a thousand dollars or so\nThe costs are people buying that a lot of people who are excited about the iPhones are saying I'm Sorry but I Can't lay out a thousand bucks and they can't even handle two years of payments on a payment plan interest free which is still forty something dollars a month\nSo now here's this experiment offering three year payment plans okay\nThis is a rotten terrible idea you end up paying more for the phone each month likely been for your service each month\nAnd so it means to step back and look at in spite of all the hype and all the ads and all that look at a more affordable phone\nWe're going to use phone look at one of the mid priced phones are lower priced phones that you can afford to buy instead of having to finance a phone for three years that's like

maybe sometimes used in a state the flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier fourth tier is a community colleges many of which now offer four year degrees each tier has a different tuition level\nGreatest irony of it though of the whole system is that people who go to a first tier state school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be in far larger class sizes than someone who goes to a fourth tier community college and the state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students or eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your ... as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six people or

from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I Do that let me\nLook them up and see what they are all about but ah I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a they ... jet number two um if they are legit today you know do a\nA low ball offer on your property and\nWhat are the dangers or to a risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching\nUse your house a house in good condition and a a establish neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about\nI'm One of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of\nCompanies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory\nWhere they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered\nTo you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate\nReally quickly typically within a month can be quicker but they just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price house get it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide but wait you get out of it is you're just done they if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done\nYou don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like\nThat I see okay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nOkay is that makes ...\nYes yes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nTotally ... no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat and he is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price a house they're not interested\nIn really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how are you going to ask them corporate thank you Tom how can I be of

cards don't enjoy the consumer protections that a consumer card does thunder pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up\nOut exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your card if they were successful you able\nTo take it over and run up charges the credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think that you Tom took good

Need to set up a new Gmail account or the way that I can use social Jews and access to all to get that going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer using a crime but for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail with Google accounts\nDid that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail\nWith Google accounts when you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having

from the from the first survivor show to them no\nWell happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\nI'm sure she did that go she listens to you too of course ah for\nSo with the ... the whole idea of a crime book where Raul and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available to a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinda things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so grown books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um insurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers\nAnd having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out of your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nClark thanks for taking my call sure Chris you got
