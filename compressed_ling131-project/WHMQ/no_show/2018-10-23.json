for many many years and stay in the game despite being relentlessly haunted by the U.S our allies because ... and ... are both kind of veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven in Afghanistan so these are both these guys attended offer which was all kinds of his primary training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan\nAnd so their journeys through jihad search all the way back then and ... actually it was again a fight very early on ... as a guy who should be groomed for a leadership position is somebody who they they rarely on thought you know sort of had that potential and lo and behold today these are two of the most senior guys\nIn um Yemen they've now leading okay there may be paid so now you know a lot of times you hear people talk about ... pie that's OK and rape and it's as if it's an affiliate of al ... well we've said all along is now it's not really an affiliate look either it's just all ... because guys like this are groomed ... veterans who\nHave been putting these positions Toledo kinda globally so they probably in our segment is they probably play a role in actually al ... global management team making decisions around the globe now a Cape he of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nGoing Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots some inspired the dollar sign at Fort Hood\nAh which was sort of had some sort of inspirational connection minimum take a pay for the most part in your piece plots against the u._s. have failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nInside Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters in Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... releases rewards for increase the reward for one of them and actually released a newer worked for the other one\nUm these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters are under their command\nThe consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that out titled looks upon its\nPersonnel as interchangeable with other personnel did they move them around in theaters to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart a personnel chart that says let's training here less training there or is it hit or miss\nWell you know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys and show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some\nThought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going back to Nineteen nineties\nBut then you see guys go from Yemen to other places so we've track them to the Sinai we tracked him to Syria and Italy province who track in the north Africa and Libya and you see these guys go out of eight creepy and they serve leadership roles in other parts of the kind of work elsewhere\nSo looks to us like this a creepy serves not only as part of the senior management structure within al ... terms of the top leaders but they have guys are they grown to go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around is that a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority of the car seat would he be a a comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nJohn it's amazing you're asking this question because\nThere's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human sort of organization looks like in years and there's never at least publicly US government is not tried to explain what the management structure of all kind of looks like and yet when you go through their primary source\nStatements and literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a management structure that's in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war it's been waged on them they still have the management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line\nPlace despite the relentless post nine eleven war it's been waged on them\nThey still have a management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line to explain it to everybody but you can pick up detail here and there for example we know when I was out here of course of the miracle ... we had at least two deputy ... by the way who according to the UN or in Iran and are helping and lead the charge for all kinds of globally former on\nBut then you have guys like this in Yemen who are fighting the Iranians his wife gets all ... complex\nOr also probably partly okay senior management team and you start putting this all together you can see that there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain to since nine eleven remember the name of the ... report\nGave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure that how these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you so how how out of date or assessments artists your\nMeasure of al ... is it showing cohesion ... is there some change in its confidence level can you tell ...\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this is the type of thing that should be everybody's ears perk up when they hear this he\nSays that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is able to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe\nIt sort of infrastructure in place this is like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we called disconnect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that has there is no cohesion there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment our from U.S officials saying no\nThere actually is social cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries\nWe think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what some\nPeople have said but it's it's interesting to hear General Dunford a very senior level express that publicly chosen something got some assessment got on that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general and he leads the effort to defeat the gal ... so when he comments as Tom says look out Tom jobs one of the foundation for the defense of democracy this\nNational security report brought

your digital experience I'm John batch\nNobody H M\nWe have been far too ambiguous about our commitments Taiwan I'd like to see the Trump Administration make it very clear I'd like to see the president actually go to Taiwan and send that symbolic message to Beijing that we are friends and allies with Taiwan and we will never let it go\nThe Russian and Chinese and us defense ministers have all been wandering around negotiating with each other talking with each other inviting each other back and forth is that going to continue regardless of this these incidents in the Taiwan Strait or the south China Sea I'm I'm puzzling about\nHow these defense ministers and our secretary of defense thing called the demonstrations by the navy card\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off\nUm and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what Beijing says it will get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement\nThat means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nThat is Gordon descending on the wording we communicate as you mentioned but we're all skin the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests you know to protest ... in the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space\nIn a tit for tat sort of weighing in ... in the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space you know the euro versus not off limits um and so you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that um see jumping has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he is seen to cave in um he very well may not be living so um you know this is going to go on for quite some time that is um but ... paying is whether\nHe's an aberration or whether he is the inevitable result of Chinese communism we've got him for a little while and we got to make sure that he understands that he cannot get what he wants\nThe Sioux City trap Gordon six point five percent that's the official number GDP said to be the slowest than a decade since the great recession two thousand eight two thousand nine whatever the real number is there is a contraction of the growth in China it depends upon that means unemployment does Xi Jinping\nDoes the standing committee did they have a response to that\nWell there are only a response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their de leveraging campaign pile on the debt\nAnd hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if you were to believe it they're encouraging one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely I'm a losing proposition for teaching pay it's just a question of how long he can although he can hold on a long time but he's making the inevitable crisis bigger\nSo they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that so he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat is Gordon how about the capital of slows you talked about before\nYeah um well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September of two thousand six team because the capital controls right now or Conan the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there's a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um and you can see that of course with the falls in the stock market and in the currency the only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China\nWhich was actually quite a strong rebound and the Shanghai composite was because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was\nAnd they probably were also buying as well so you know and under those circumstances it's no longer a market\nUm but you starting to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge ... seats in paying as opposed to the United states and the American response that thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\nDoes the renminbi go to seventh or did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency\nI thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine so I think I was wrong on that\nAnd you know of course the only time will tell but I think that they eventually after all that what they should do John is a big one time devaluation shocked the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nAt one time devaluation ... what that looks like\nOh you know going to eight or eight and a half to the U.S dollar um from six point nine three which is where they are now and then that really shocks everybody and it stops the slow erosion when you have slow erosion you have the central bank\nI'm starting to spend foreign exchange reserves to no good at and that's what we saw last month you know twenty two point seven billion dollars a decline in their foreign exchange reserves\nAnd it doesn't really do any good John So I think they need a one time big ...

Chula\nOrganizers says CNN plan for them to begin moving north reaching the northern city of walks law which is about twenty miles north and resting there\nThe president has been responding with tweets these last days certainly the president of the United states has made it very clear that he wants to make this he is making this a partisan issue saying the Democrats want this\nThe Democrats are behind us and other remarks pointing to the Democrats he's also the president and his aides at the White House are\nSaying that they're unknown middle Easterners and the cat\nJohn it begin with you this care of that looks like a problem for the Democrats and I want to look at the Senate races\nArizona which is said to be close Texas not close but certainly Beto O'Rourke is a premier candidates for the Democrats Montana clubs Nevada clubs Missouri I Can't tell Tennessee I Can't tell but certainly leaning Republican\nJust the caravan change any of those states for the Senate and does it change the house seats that are at risk in those states job\nWell it's an awful visual because I'm Democrats are almost paralyzed from commenting on this because you know there's a sea of brown faces and even black faces and the care of him\nAnd to go criticize it doesn't say that we have to protect our sovereignty is too risky politically incorrect messed up Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee you're going to have commercials for the last few days with the campaign which will\nFuture quotes from all the leading Democrat starting with Kamala Harris from California and Elizabeth Warren saying we have to abolish ice the immigration service and then there will be the pictures of the hordes climbing\nA I sat next to someone at dinner who's from Hungary very knowledgeable of Hungarian politics during the migrant crisis of twenty Fifteen\nHungary was able to stop Ninety nine percent of its immigration problems with the fence\nOr and he said I Believe that this could do to the Democrats this fall with the migrant issue did Angela Merkel which is painter as powerless and unwilling to defend the sovereignty of her country\nDavid Guatemalan President Jimmy morale it said earlier this month we have arrested almost one hundred people highly linked to terrorist groups specifically ISIS I don't know the facts in Guatemala but the suggestion is that the White House is linking this to ISIS\nOr does this change the face of the election in the Senate as you measure it David\nDon't think so but that's only because I think the Senate is already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible\nI don't think so but that's only because I think the Senate has already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible\nThis message could have an impact in Arizona and Nevada um most of all possibly Montana Texas a secure I think Tennessee isn't a good spot\nUm and I think just Republicans in the Senate in general are are good shape and they're only competitive house each really that could be swayed either way it's among the states and the better but I Do think it's Martin messaging by the president or look it gives your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason\nTo get ginned up about the opposition party and in the mid term when you hold the White House the old all balance of power what you want to do is try and convince your voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do\nWhen you have no power as bad things from your point of view are already happening\nSo your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's the president's doing with this message of the you know the one counter here\nIs republic is Democrats are not playing ball they're not engaging here or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy call me we can\nTalk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want they used to be a but but the other thing that I get Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he has at his disposal the power\nTo stop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent like national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to them as the Jay Z swan and diminished\nThe danger that they posed the middle east into American national security in general this was a case where\nA President Trump was warning of this while I think it's a good election year message down the stretch ultimately\nHe's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that if Democrats really getting to listen they can say look yeah President Trump has the power to deal with is we're not standing in his way\nSaturdays but don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean\nI don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the mid term dumping immigrants or at least have to say something on this will be the 'cause Jon talked about David what can they say after David\nI I don't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think at the same way I think it's more for the president's push that sort of political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing you don't anger your base by by by trying to outflank trip on the right\nAnd you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and it gets into the country say\nNothing the most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is that I was a I clearly for border security and Mrs President Trump's job to deal with this because he's the president and and that's what I think they should there John\nI think that's a good strategy except that there's somebody than the Democrats who earlier earlier said it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't repudiate their previous position or they try to model that I think that just gives turns to debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turned to to immigration which is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on\nThat is a base turnout model\nKen we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos so we don't know what's going to happen the next two weeks but they're marching marching marching\nThey're not going to stop until they reach the border and that's where

having me\nUm yeah so that these documents were filed a late night friday it's in a case involving a lawsuit for some of these Carter Page by the documents that the you know that we can chasing for quite a while now and a kind of sucked into the hundred and fifty plus page report revelation\nNot entirely surprising but he'll still a few of the gaps ... what were what this whole investigation that the FBI used multiple confidential human sources\nWhile it was compiling information on Carter Page and the Trump campaign and all these things so that the new revelation there is that we already knew about foster steal the British spy who wrote the dossier that equate accused tromp on the campaign of all these things\nI'm so this new document or refers to multiple of coral a informants that were used and so you and I talk quite a bit about stuff on our the University of Cambridge professor who has been revealed to also be an informant\nWho met with page and George Papadopoulos and every one and uh so now we have those two known informants\nPlus others and so the question that you and I and everyone else would like to find out uh who are these informants when did they crucially when did they start ah their work on behalf of the ... and how much were they paid and all of those those types of questions\nThe quote from Mr hearty the FBI is protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI as well as quote information provided by those sources so we have a long list to investigate we know steal\nWe know how her or the FBI has never acknowledged ... correct Chuck that's that's we've surmise and other reporters have confirmed the surmise that help has one of them but we don't know does

... for ... coy was connecting with the FBI so do we believe down his name is in this filing\nYeah it very well could be a ... that's an interesting possibility a downer himself has given just you know one or two interviews since his name surfaced last December\nA it's connected to Papadopoulos\nUm and he's not saying a whole lot he's not a ... he ... he was obviously in the Australian government we're\nBundling information back to the FBI and the question would be to the FBI considered him a confident SCA chest and their parlance confidence for human source or was he merely you know just a offered this one off tip 'em and so\nIt's very possible that down or is considered one of their confidence of human sources um there are others that you know or who have been involved in the ... who make contact with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos and these guys I'm throughout the campaign who who very well could of sharing information with the FBI\nUm and and as I mentioned you know someone a according to these documents someone was paid for their work and so that raises\nYou know we we can assume that perhaps\nDown her since she was an Australian Government official perhaps was not paid for that work so they're all in addition to doubt or others\nOut there um and so it'd be very interesting to find out what information they provided but also with the whole Carter Page vice versa and and and this newfound did not get into it but you and I've also discuss how um Republicans on on the hill of referred to\nPotentially exculpatory evidence contained in the fourth and final five so\nUh that that somehow a pain to a different picture of the information regarding Carter Page and so I'm going to go back to Rod Rosenstein who's going to be speaking to Capitol Hill I'm\nOn Wednesday I Believe um he he signed this particular five says\nSo this is the question that you know hopefully they'll be asked to we we can expect him to try to dodge the question um as far as what type of exculpatory information there might be\nBut it's a the next to piece that that would help put all together and it's also one of the aspects that the President Trump has been interested in declassify from these documents\nRight and it's miss erosion seen who stopped that the classification President Trump wanted the foresight to warrant he wanted the FBI question and answer the thrill choose with Bruce or who was in ... who remains in the OJ principal\nAnd who was involved in communicating with Mr Steele to the FBI another he was a go between his wife Nelly are worked for Glenn Simpson of fusion GPS who has now taken the ... I think we should note that Carter that I Am Carter Page needs to the uh the Carter page investigation doesn't happen without Glenn Simpson\nAnd Glenn Simpsons no longer cooperating with anybody so chalk we moved the story a little bit also in the White House request for release\nWas the word the text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein himself\nSo there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet and the FBI is being coy about what it will or will not release protecting confidential sources Papadopoulos is testifying this week to Congress is that accurate Chuck\nBut yet he's testifying on Thursday to the to the task force or\nThe same task force that his interview James Baker the FBI lawyer Nelly or and ah Bruce or\nUm House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committee interviewing Papadopoulos and um if you follow Papadopoulos on Twitter um he's made quite a few comments recently about a lot of these what he says they're suspicious contacts that he had while on the campaign and we've documented I've documented you and I talked about ...\nWho is definitely a suspicious or contract he was an FBI informant uh George Papadopoulos has said that he\nHad at least three or four more strange contacts people coming up to him and wind to meet with him while he was on the campaign um and he now believes since he's been through you know a B he's a he's interaction with helper\nNow believe that perhaps other informants other people working on behalf of western intelligence so were sent to approach him to perhaps clean information from him does\nHe think metal ... does he think ... was one of those ... one of those FBI informants\n... yeah yeah he does um he he believes and he's not laid out I'll be honest these not laid out a clear and articulate kind of\nA there is no evidence yet tying Mitt sued to down or to help her um no not one clear narrative here um but they these are three or four I'm very\nInteresting um approaches that he he you know he had um and so his theory seems to be that there's some sort of connection here um because you know as as he claims he and he he he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but he's not found you know he was not charged\nWith anything beyond the the lowest one thousand one charge for lying um he's not been accused of conspiracy so um and what we've heard from several law as well as that soon after the investigation was open based upon information about Papadopoulos the down or information um there were some piece of\nEvidence that the government receive potentially exculpatory evidence which kind of under cut the initial narratives\nAre that the government had to to open an investigation based on Papadopoulos so um he he wants to talk to Congress about all of\nThat uh we don't know yet exactly what next mission will provide 'em but you know some below for it could potentially change a store here give us some new which\nCan follow up on Jack Ross for the Daily Caller waiting for Rosen staying in Papadopoulos I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nWhat do you teach him [laughter] [noise] what type\nYou told rich Lowry that Mueller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however when I take from that remark and say we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV what we're going to get is either\nNo indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians cheaply and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign\nYou believe in significant however that the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteen explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn when he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with\nInvestigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking prosecutors\nWhen they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or is to be sentenced by the court\nUntil after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're going to give her expected to given the investigation\nOr because you want the full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing court so I think the fact that General Flynn is now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team\nIndicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court testimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign or so that is another thing that leads me to think that the investigation is probably\nWinding down to a conclusion as far as the Woodward comparison is concerned might might point to in in my discussion with rich and I appreciate\nUh your mention of the the McCarthy report podcast um [noise] the point of that discussion\nWas that Mahler works for the Justice Department as a prosecutor he is not the lawyer for a congressional impeachment committee and a prosecutor is only real job to report is whether to recommend bringing charges or not or declining charges\nOn a particular investigation and a particular set of facts that he's been authorized to investigate so to my mind it's not ... job to do a disc lose ...\nOn the fitness of the president to be president the question is whether there's enough evidence to to bring charges based on the things that he's been authorized to investigate\nThat is [noise] and you mentioned in the past how this would not be a surprise for Mr Rosen staying there signed can continue\nTo stress that this was all necessary but she also made the point and briefing last article was well there are a lot of the stuff for the special counsel's during has been handed off to other departments existing departments adjuster and really I mean you have to show why this was necessary or just still stream I totally agree with that\nI Do agree with that I think that you know we question that he is whether this investigation was necessary because it was not\nAssigned in compliance with the regulations of the Justice Department which require ... showing that there is a conflict of interest that makes it impossible for the Justice Department to investigate the matter in the normal course and that there's a factual basis for believing that some\nA criminal charge may be appropriate because some crime has been committed um there was never any showing that there was this kind of conflict of interest\nAnd there was never any articulation of the factual basis for a criminal investigation and the fact I think that\nThe portions of the investigation like the to Russia indictments that Mahler return have been transition took components of the Justice Department\nIs strongly indicative of the fact that there was never any\nConflict of interest in the first place I don't think those cases should have been brought because I think that the the charging instruments there were more in the nature of a\nPublicity uh announcements than real charges nobody ever thought\nThat the including Mahler I'm sure that ah Vladimir ... was going to allow his awkward has to be brought to America for a trial so bring an indictment like that was was pointless in that sense but the fact that it's been transition to ... to go and they've been transitions\nTwo components of the Justice Department indicates that there's no reason the Justice Department couldn't have done this investigation and the first place\nWe're speaking with Andrew McCarthy of the national Review Online and all of the McCarthy report his his

Rodriguez the Latina picture there's very few people that actually displays but there's no in between and if you um and I've never been able to find any answer on that\nIf you look at of course you grow up with a Red Sox and everything that you had variations of socks that you could wear\nA back in the day so you could pull up your pants to maybe a foot off the ground or something like that show\nAnd then they used as a stress Frank Robinson ... formerly of the Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore is especially ah he was the one that came up with those really skinny stir up said that he made them himself he would take the regular strip socks that we all used to wear back when we played Babe Ruth and stuff\nWhich are horrible a disturbed came all the way down and do you get a little bit of your little white sock would show\nThat was Frank Robinson that came up with the idea to do make disturbs nice and skinny right and uh so I as a result you looked kind of dramatic an athletic and\nGod Forbid uh but you had choices in those days now you only have two choices and I can never figure this out you have two choices you can do with as they say you can with a nice software pie or you can bring your parents all the way down so that they drag\nThe ground there's nothing in between stand is I cannot even be there but uh that's that's seems to be the way it is now so either one or the other or is this all trend everybody you know kind of goes with the trend uh but anyway yeah they are the\nSox but they display red jackets and red sleeves and read this red red Sox [laughter] long haired couple of them actually where Red Sox [laughter] so what has got a ... what was it the uh the blue socks um [noise] oh there was some team it was like a minor league affiliate and they were the\nThe new socks except they didn't wear blue socks they wore black Sox they were called the blue socks with there were black socks and they were affiliated with the red Sox are you telling me I'm anyway yeah my father I got this jacket and this was a this is a vintage red shocked Red Sox jacket from like I don't know\nRed Sox are you telling me I'm anyway yeah my father I got this jacket and this was a this was a vintage red shocked Red Sox jacket from like I don't know when's the last time that they were the navy blue a warmup jackets I don't know probably Twenty years ago right they've been wearing the red for quite a while now\nYeah in fact ever since the John Henry group took over a management of the team that even though we're in the red coats and the red sleeves and everything else every everything was navy blue before that with just a little hint of read there was a little tiny to read on the hat [laughter] no no red anywhere else or the red Sox is\nBut anyway um when my father died he's a lifelong Red Sox are I don't know we sort of had a love hate relationship tell you the truth he hated them as as much as love them because they always let them down [laughter] that was the thing ah my father's favorite player and of course one of mine would have been Ted Williams\nAnd uh when it came time to championships or anything like that to the good didn't do a whole lot of that regard or so of course the sports writers vilified ... Williams for years and years and years but my father would tell you that he was he was the greatest ever saw to actually saw to it I saw to play once I also saw him when I was a kid\nI saw him fly casting in they used to have this big maybe they still do it but it was called the sportsmen as something or other such a big advantage was at the Hynes auditorium I remember we went a couple of times and we weren't outdoors or the ... my father never took us camping or anything like that but we would go to these things\nBasically 'cause celebrities are going to be there and uh yeah I remember they had this big like a swimming pool type thing and\nTed was up there a showing how great he could to cast a rod and using the swimming pools and they'd be keep calm and carry the same time so she had a couple of times\nA day waves and then when the table you know died a they had a big thing at Fenway Park and they open up in ... park and uh we went into my son ... who was going to school in Boston at the time\nWe went in and uh roam the all across the outfield and talked to was ran across the aisle feel grass we broke the road we're broke through a ... ran over there we jumped over the rope and ran across the aisle feel grass and got in trouble for it\nBut uh yeah yeah and they had all these pictures they had a big blown up pictures of cat is a fighter pilot in both World War two and Korea\nAnd they had these big pictures a mounted on the green monster and so yeah so you get those kind of cool walking around the park but anyway when my father died or they were going to bury him my sisters are going to bury him with this a very ... very jak that I'm we're in right now uh they were going to bury him in this and\nI saw the preparations go to go forward on and on and on I don't know I don't\nKnow what good is it going to do him to bury him in his coat plus it was a love hate relationship with the red Sox and not all love\nAnd because of my father never live to see a David Ortiz or Manny Ramirez or Pedro Martinez or any of that so the kind of missed out at all that fun\nAnd uh so no I I took the jacket right out of the casket before the weight has done in order to do something else put them in a suit and the suit that you're going to put it is not a suit that I Would care to own so let's put him in that sort of the ... so that's what we did\nAnd uh yeah and I told a story before people think I'm making it up the um the day that uh my father died there was this a horrendous relief pitcher for the red Sox\nUm oh what was his name of ... okay they traded heat the slippery slope them\nOn the day that my father died he hated he just looked the more than any other Red Sox player past presidents or he hated he ... and so they traded this bomb and they traded him for Derek Lowe and Jason ... the Seattle Mariners\nNow didn't seem like much of the time OK beverage I could probably be the catcher lower probably be a decent picture people had no idea that they would be instrumental in the red Sox success over the years and so I whispered to my father\nAnd his casket awake I Wish they traded he slips slogans and I do this I also go do this and he smiled I Swear to God he smiled right there in the funeral\nI'm Jennifer ... with your money now\nA high profile Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia has to be done in Riyadh the kingdom's first major event on the world stage\nSince the killing of writer Jim all cash show the as the Saudi conflict and assemble earlier this month\nThe future investment initiative form is the brainchild of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman it's aimed at drawing more foreign investment into the kingdom and to help create desperately needed jobs the forum last year proved to be a glitzy affair that you more international business attention to the kingdom\nReally do a where it was just talking earlier about the ... the very idea of the red Sox and there's only maybe three players on the team who actually display Red Sox you know rock hoping in one of them and ... charts right [laughter] yeah that's pretty funny a little\nUh any questions here do you have anything that you're concerned about ... sale or\nYeah I have I ... I ... I have a big question and concern about the first starting pitchers were day morning [laughter] and Chris sailing and David Price it's like you know which uh you know when is maybe it maybe it won't fall off but when it's Chris sales aren't going to fall\nOff [laughter] um and ...\nAnd ... and can and can David Price put together to a solid starts I'm In the postseason so yeah I think you can I think you can start with um with the starting pitcher tonight\nIt seemed like price might have turned the corner I mean that last game he seemed to have that confidence back that you haven't seen in years with him right and we're finally you were using these never had any success in the post season and then he picks that Jim or last week\nSo I don't know maybe he's straightened themself out a ... I was in charge of the ... you do have to wonder about Chris Sale or where they are a little bit that they've been very careful with him down the stretch because he ran out of gas last year as everybody remembers so I don't know ... but of course you know you\n... going to do to it's October and then our\nOur team is you know representing the American like that so I think we just need to kind of leave it\nOr we spell dear God I ... it doesn't seem that long ago\nThat this was never even anybody's imagination but now we have a Red Sox a team in the world series and winning World Series my God the women World Series\nAnd all I mean now it's like an expectation\nWell it has been Fifteen Years now um yeah I mean you know since since two thousand and three um you know the organization is either has either one something more than on the verge of winning so yeah so you know guys\nYou know guys are age who you know remember the you know the the the nineties in the eighties and and the seventies and you know blah blah blah blah blah we you know we know we know all about that but literally for the pet for the last Fifteen Years the red Sox have been right there all all\nThe way up I'm going to the end so we are [noise] I I don't think we can say we're spoil anymore the organization has just been has done just marvelous job\nScott Gomez we lose our Tuesdays with Scotty Wednesday ah what's the first World Series that you covered\nThat I covered and\nI'm the first World Series that I covered would have been um I guess two thousand and four okay um yeah two thousand and four when she hears seniors a great story for if you want to want to go that route and he's gave Robert says the manager\nOf the of the Dodgers yes\nAnd um you know back in back in two thousand and for the red Sox were down three games to none are\nIn the in the playoffs they were down four to three are going to the bottom of the ninth inning and Mariano Rivera was on the mound so you know it's just like you know forget about it you're out you know get swept four straight games from the Yankees well\nKevin I'm all our walks they put Dave Roberts any stole second base a Miller got to face it or or

day of the world series and of course I go back to a time as you know I'm spry and I I go back to a time\nWhen the world series or already be over by now [laughter] the whole thing would be over by now [laughter]\nUh so now you're getting into winter and we're going to start the world series but you know that's the way as\nA D I have my Red Sox jacket on today Monty is dressed for the occasion Monday's wearing a Red Sox suspenders which will I'm sure ... come up in the discussion on the building which will build them and of course being a Yankee fan\nWhen they don't even know beat me in a very very close and exciting match in pong it's on to a couple of weeks back\nUh I said you could be the first person since my uncle bill who I hugged who is a Yankees fan so [laughter]\nSo yeah so they'll be getting the the business today as Monti has Red Sox suspenders I guess then you've got to be your Salvation Army or something\nI got my socks a jacket on and I've got my Red Sox jacket on this will be the navy blue jacket that they have not won in years they always wear the red jackets now the warm up jackets but uh yeah this is a this was a navy blue that belonged to my father and they were going to my sisters were going to bury him in this a jacket\nI go to the funeral home and I see them getting ready to last night I don't know it's a perfectly good jacket and in fact it's funny to the ... every time I Would wear this in years past\nAge ... would show up on my hands as if they weren't my father's hands there's kind of weird now the age watch come anyway but they usually come only when I Would wear this coat so\nUh but anyway yeah he um he was staying with us when we lived in North Hampton and he came up this toward the end of his life and he was a stand up but he always had to start off spring weather was opening day or first day of spring or whatever or he always had to have a brand new Red Sox hat\nAnd so he's asked me like where am I going to get a Red Sox had around here I said I bet western village would have one right down the main street in North Hampton and sure enough they went down there at a nice conversation with the the guy that do owned it and uh he's very good with ... my father who would break in the brim just nice skipped a nice curving the brim and on\nSo you know there was ... she was very happy uh but uh yeah I [laughter]\nI wasn't gonna stand for a kid he buried in this call from what good is that right\nSo I don't where the ... very often Emory will tell you that it doesn't look very good on me I don't know so\nSo I only wear for special occasions I probably got to put the flag out today too I have an American flag and I only fly it on special occasions the fourth of July and Labor Day things like that but I often will put it operated the Sox are in the world series so\nI got to remember that today because it might be rainy today so you can't really put up in the rain but anyway but uh yeah it is uh the first game of the world series the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red such a great match up it would be a classic old teams from from way back to the original sex in the national league American way\nSo yeah so it's who's going to be doing a the the two left painters battle of the two aces a Clinton curve Shaw\nFor the I'm a Dodgers and are are okra sales for the red Sox and both of them very even though ... they're both about the same height like they're like six foot five or something but\n... for some reason looks a lot bigger than they are in fact it looks taller too and he's not much taller than say a lot ... than the other but anyway it it it should be a good one and um\nYou know to form a Red Sox players are going against each other records so Alex ... who played for the red Sox as utility player and a ... uh the manager of the Dodgers who is remembered fondly by Red Sox nation for the greatest stolen base in the history of stolen bases\nAre about maybe go to Lou Brock Maury Wills but really as far as the restaurant\nThe fondly by Red Sox nation for the greatest stolen base in the history of stolen bases are you well maybe you go to Lou Brock or Maury Wills but really as far as the rest of our shores are concerned he's stolen base in two thousand four was the stolen base we'll talk more about that in a few minutes here on one on one board far WHAT\nI'm Jennifer ... with your money now super microcomputers isn't a letter to customers or the media report claiming a malicious hardware chip was installed in its mother boards is incorrect\nAnd its conducting a review in light of the story to San jose based company says or does he know malicious hardware chips implanted in its mother board but adds that it is undertaking a complicated and time consuming review to further address the article which was written by Bloomberg\nMeanwhile apple and Amazon called on Bloomberg to retract it story Kellogg's honey smacks are returning to Shell's following a voluntary recall after salmonella infected one hundred people and thirty three states the company says uh Syria will return next month in limited quantities of the simpler updated recipe\nYeah he's he's he has mix things up and you know I mean the classic example is that is when number one ... cult hit for the cycle yep and then the next day is not in the line I mean\nWhen I was afraid I've got a you've got to have a pretty good team to do that you\nReally do a where we're just talking earlier about the ... the very idea of the red Sox and there's only maybe three players on the team who actually display Red Sox you know ... being one of them ... right yeah that's pretty funny\nOr any questions here do you have anything that you're concerned about Chris sales are\nYeah I ... I ... I have a big question and concerned about the first to starting pitchers ... [laughter] and Chris sailing and David Price it's like you know which uh you know ... ... maybe maybe it won't fall off but when it's Chris sales aren't going to fall\nOff [laughter] um and ... and ... and can and can\nDavid Price put together to a solid starts I'm In the postseason so yeah I think you can I think you can start with um with the starting pitcher tonight\nIt seemed like price might have turned a corner I mean that last game he seemed to have that confidence back but you haven't seen in years with him right and we're finally we're using these never had any success in the postseason and then he puts that Jim or last week\nSo I don't know maybe he's straightened themself out a ... I was in charge of a ... you do have to wonder about Chris Sale or where they are a little bit that have been very careful with him down the stretch because he ran out of gas last year as everybody remembers\nSo I don't know ... but of course you know you ...\nGoing to do it it it's October and [laughter] and our our team is you know representing the American laid back so I think we just need to kind of leave it\nOr we spoiled here God I ... it doesn't seem that long ago\nThat this was never even anybody's imagination that don't have a Red Sox a team in the world series and winning World Series my God the window World Series\nAnd I mean now it's like an expensive well it has been Fifteen Years\nNow um yeah I mean you know since since two thousand and three um you know the organization is either has either one or something more than on the verge of winning so yeah so you know guys you know guys our age you know remember the you know the the\nThe nineties in the eighties and and the seventies and you know blah blah blah blah blah we you know we don't we know about\nThat but literally for the pet for the last Fifteen Years the red Sox have been right there are all the way up I'm going to the end so we are I I don't think we can say we're spoil anymore the organization has just been has done just a marvelous job\nScott ... is our Tuesdays with Scotty when's the uh what's the first World Series that you covered\nThe first World Series that I covered would have been I guess two thousand and four to here's a great story for if you want to want to go that route in these gave Roberts is the manager of the of the Dodgers yes\nBack in back in two thousand and for the red Sox were down three games to none in the playoffs they were down four to three are going to the bottom of the ninth inning and Mariano Rivera was on the mound so you know it's just like you know forget about it you're out you know get swept four straight games from the Yankees well\nKevin I'm all our walks they put Dave Roberts any stole second base a Miller got the ... or or cheese won the game in extra innings and\nThe red Sox peeled off um seven straight wins to win the world series as that was that was the most incredible thing I've ever seen because I think I've told this story to you before and even on the air all of the new ...\nAnd that was that was the most incredible thing I've ever seen because I think I've told this story to you before and even on the air all of the New England or\nCities are close together you know there's you know Providence Hartford Boston Springfield uh Portland Maine Manchester New Hampshire and you know they all they all have TV stations and you know we're all covering the games and the fact that they were in New York and in Boston as opposed to like you know New York in Cleveland or New York and Los Angeles\nWe covered every single game and we're all friends because you know we would all you know we'd all go out after the games were over especially when we are on the road and then there was a really nice camaraderie\nAmong the um the the New England TV sports media so in going to the bottom of the night down or run down three games a lot of people left the ballpark and we all\nKind of slid down and we sat on the lower box seats we had our cameras in our tribe pods and we were ready to go out on the field and you are you know post game interviews on live shots and all that\nAnd the and a couple of us looked at each other and I'll never forget it we just said man which we're not going to get to go back to New York and you know have fun on the company dime are we this this looks this looks like this is going to kind of be the end of it and we were really sad because we have fun together\n[laughter]\nAnd the red Sox won that game we went back to New York uh we we went to St Louis and man it was it was just it was the best time I ever had covering sports on I'll never forget\nNight do you still are you still in contact with the some of your calls oh yeah\nOh yeah of course I you know I I mean I don't do the TV thing anymore but when I went down I remember going to uh Celtics game last year and I you know I'd bump into a lot of guys who are who are still doing it and others you know there's not that many left a lot of us have moved away are gone on to other things but\nUm I mean another great story my my photographer from channel forty fellow named Bob\nHastings ... a phrase from South wick and he'd never been on an airplane before no\nNever and also here we are flying out to St Louis to cover the world series I I you know he could barely contain himself [laughter]\nIt was just it was a really a it was a really cool I'm a cool thing to experience and then of course you know they did it again in in two thousand and seven to two thousand and Thirteen so you know we're uh we're used to this kind of stuff\nAnd then move you don't ... the game in question that you're talking about with the the famous stolen base by a deep Roberts the most famous stolen base ever are that game made it three to one ... and and\nEven that was just the beginning I was just the beginning but you had a feeling from that just that very game just the atmosphere and or cheese winning the game that they were going to win the series it was a there is this collective a euphoria wait a minute they're gonna win this thing now and we ... it impossible odds\nIt completely impossible laws and and and and in many ways that was the that was the period of time where David Ortiz became David Ortiz turned into this you know folk hero I mean you know they they get swept four games to none he doesn't win that game with the home run an extra innings and I believe he did it again a couple of games later\nAnd you know then what he did in the world series in since so yeah I mean it's it's funny the way you know moments and chocolate chips in and careers turn on on one single instance it's remarkable\nIt's amazing any preventative and who knows you know what who knows what's gonna happen over the next ten days this year you know who's who you know what we make something may happen tonight or tomorrow night or or more over the weekend that we we never get tired of talking [laughter] I just never know\nThe Clinton ... short course the ace of the Dodgers who apparently is pitching tonight\nI don't know I think he's got the kind of stuff that they can hit I think he can he dominates an awful lot of teams but I've seen ... before he looks like a a pitcher that the red Sox can handle so on my prediction is they're going to get him early that's that's my predict what's yours\nWell mine is I'm Glad that um there was some talk about whether I'm a crush of what's going to start game on because he had pitch the ninth inning I'm In the last game of the ale CSI guess what over the weekend [noise] but\nUm but the fact that he that he and sell our starting tonight and I said it in sports report this morning means that there's there's a chance to see them if it goes seven games to see them pitched three times\nYeah like the old days yeah\nYeah and I don't know I Can't I the only the last picture I remember winning three games in a World Series was um was I was either was Mickey low which I think\nYeah yeah I'm In Nineteen sixty eight I mean I I Can't remember whether it's been done since then I don't know yeah ... you know you got a chance you know we've got a chance to witness history here so I'm like I Can't wait for it to start\n[laughter] me neither either because I'll be

to be here um yeah I think it's always something that we talk about um whenever people gloves means that they want to run for office I was there was two jobs are actually going for ones being the candidate and one's actually being legislator and they're very different um and unfortunately especially\nIn this world now I mean if you're going to be in a campaign mode as a kid but you got inspired people you've got to speak well you've got to look at the ... you've got to do all this other stuff that doesn't necessarily relate to the actual job and you're right I think Jay I mean he was in a secretary you've been in health\nCare and administrators and finance ministers from finding under Deval Patrick who ... where he did a great job did a great job so he understands the budget I went to see the more talking about the budget I mean he has some great ideas like you're right off the policies\nI Would like to see more substantial way as well how we're going to pay for stuff um what his plan so I think he's great I met him many times are we start done many times\nBut um I think given that you have some struggles with the campaign I also think the state party hasn't stepped up I'm outside democratic parties having stepped into kind of help out because Charlie makers got Seventy two percent approval rating and so it was was born right and people look at that and potential donors look at that and\nSay why am I going to spend money on a campaign that has very little chance of being successful and of course though fewer dollars that come into a campaign right is a little

continue our conversation with state representative and Vegas from Holyoke during the break you and I were talking about represented we were talking about how Charlie\nBaker has managed to keep his image and foster this image of a traditional Republican the fiscally conservative a but still socially a liberal\nRepublican as a kind of did Jacob Javits of years ago\nUm the salt and stalls perhaps\nBut a lot of that is not because Charlie Baker is so traditionally Republican because as you pointed out while we were talking during their break he's managed to foster this image of having a distance from Donald Trump which is paying enormous dividends for him politically he explain that a bit force\nWhile I think what he's able to do like you said it's just it's just sort of come out and say you know I mean I'm In favor of marriage equality I'm In favor of between writes\nI have people in my family so again connecting to voters and call out you know what President Trump has been doing um in calling it out as not part of his party in Colorado's extreme or calling out as somebody who doesn't agree with and said he wasn't going to vote for him and stuff like that of course this is back from a little bit now if you voted down the ticket voting for Bill\nWho's a Trump million and if you will running against it was one of the games with Warren so that's giving them a little bit of hot water but he was again he was trying to come back to yeah I'm a traditional Republican uh\nAnd I'll support the Trump feast or a candidate for Senate if I have to but then I'm going to walk back oh so you kind of no I don't really balloon launches on an island or is that so you know but then this time right now where I mean the Republican Party is in this you know split\nI mean in Massachusetts right Scott Lively still give twenty percent of the boats and the Republican primary primary right I mean in in the skyline of being the far right All right famous mostly famous for his supporters they kill the gays bill in Uganda and the ... so\nSo if you did was different from if you thought he was able to so basically there was I think that the extreme party I'm not that guy I Know I Want to get things done and he uses a lot of send messages that come out of the legislature like from speaker delete or of\nHey we're not do you see we get things done bipartisan right it might be only thirty three Republicans in a hundred and twenty seven Democrats but let me get plenty of their votes we can say far apart and there's like five or seven\nRepublicans in the Senate via for their votes it's only bipartisan so he was able to say as his leadership to say we're not Washington we get things done and we do a bipartisan way well let's talk about some of that\nBipartisanship and the legislature and specifically whether or not the legislature is going to get things done\nBecause at the end of the last session there were major pieces of legislation that did not move major policy questions before the legislature that have not been resolved and I like to address at least two of them if we can today\nThat one has healthcare because healthcare now takes ... a forty to forty four percent of the Massachusetts state budget\nAnd coming to grips with health care costs in coverage is enormously important issue this was an issue that representative coke I just was devoted to trying to solve and of course his death and as it was is is not only sad for so many reasons but includes the one that\nWe've lost his expertise on health care if they do and so what's going to happen with health care and the legislature this next session well what has to happen\nSomething has to have I mean so it is it continues to be a priority or there's already been statements of leadership saying that health care will be a prayer for next session\nBut I think the thing is is that again with two hundred elected hundred and sixty wraps them for the senators\nGetting consensus a special and health care is not the easiest thing especially in my opinion when you put together is on the bus the bills that have so much in it I mean the Senate bill basically wanted to rewrite healthcare again I'm not saying it's good or bad but that's basically what it was doing that so much in there\nThe house or whatever we running of Romneycare revising Rodney care if you will exactly and of course the house version as always the case was was much more conservative and smaller in scope um but also the issue is that we've dealt with some of the big issues in a totally different way\nThe one issue for me on the healthcare is price variants I mean that's that is what price variants what's that the fact that private insurers\nWhen they create a contract with Boston medical and they will then pay twenty two thousand dollars for a hip replacement\nAnd then when they finally come over to ... medical center and we obviously have a much smaller private pay base they can say well you know we're only going to be twelve thousand dollars for a hip replacement that much of a disparity is that the only one of your medium this Fifteen hospitals below point nine\nIn Boston medical and children's get one point nine two\nTimes what the middle price in the middle prices so you're talking about almost ... almost twice as much reimbursement for costs and reduce the same procedure then he's got\nBlue Cross Blue Shield coming around saying oh colonoscopy don't quote me on the knows exactly what we're gonna pay five Seventy\nThey've come up with it I Know and I know is there [laughter]\nDon't quote me on the knows exactly what we're gonna pay five Seventy\nThey've come up with it I Know and I know\nAre there [laughter] regular pay five\nSeventy degrees Dickinson who's part of a bigger bigger on both\nBecause clearly Dickinson is part of Mass General and therefore Mass General has some\nNegotiating power and so I got it and then they come to Holyoke again and say we're going to give you three hundred and eighty bucks but at the same procedure in the same area San ... Fifteen miles away but you only reimbursed and then the top ... thing I noticed is that then Blue Cross Blue Shield some of the letter\nTo her and say we realize that there's been an issue with the price without reimbursement rates were not committed to giving the six dollars more for the next four years [noise] so [noise]\nLess than twenty dollars over for your reimburse within and goes even closer so low priced variants issue so what we want to do is create a minimum wage for hospitals that knows you get paid more or less than point nine\nSo they have to get one of the Fifteen hospitals that are below get 'em up to a point nine\nWithin two mayors that's Ninety percent of the medium Ninety percent of the medium thank you and that would probably put a cap on the ceiling 'cause that's what insurance companies want up say they couldn't increase their rates more than two and a half percent over the next five years or maybe tied to the gym I see increases right 'cause that's the whole thing the insurance companies threaten\nThe G. I. C. increases being the state the state health insurance insurance plan okay I'm\nSorry I'm that they're saying oh well if we turn around and give her medical center point nine and ... the the medium run up they're gonna increase rates over here which is not true it's a sixty seven million dollar fix to bring Fifteen hospitals up to the up to a level that give them sustainable\nFor insurance companies and their world fifty seven million dollars\nSubject in first class flights and drinking water and you'll be fine\nThere are obviously many issues involved in the healthcare and this is one of them and we could spend the rest of our time for sure talking about health care I Would like to get your perspective on another major issue for the legislature\nWhich is the education uh funding ... across the commonwealth again an issue that died in the legislature and died but it didn't get it through the legislature last session it will be back because the funding formula is\nCritical critics in cities and towns across Massachusetts how's that going to work out or what should work out and your judgment\nAnd I would say two things I mean he's up of education you also have three sections ready to early education then of course elementary and secondary and so I'm middle school and high school and then hire at the focus in on high school and high school and elementary with the chapter Seventy funding that's where education funding comes from the state to our cities and towns\nAround chapter seven days after the chapter Seventy the general laws and that's where the funding that that that's what's crazy formulas comes right out among other things chapter Seventy yes to the rub is supposed to be that\nA lot happens in baseball in seven months yes it's been seven months since opening day so you're forgiven for not being up to speed here's a cheat sheet to help you sound like the authoritative baseball fan\nYou've always wanted to sound like and here to help us all sound authoritative\nWe have to Goldman Northampton resident a member of savor the society of American baseball researchers a baseball historian\nWho has much to share with us\nAnd so I Would like to go through some of these pieces that are in the times today\nThis under the ... page that is facing the cheat sheet itself doesn't get any better to clubs rich and history and cash collide\nAnd I'd like your perspective as we go through this to Goldman reading sure dateline Boston there'll be no underdogs than a hundred and fourteen ths World Series which opens at Fenway Park today\nThe west and George Dodgers who've gone three decades without a title but have spent about one point four billion in salaries to claim the last six nationally west crowns the Boston Red Sox you know that quaint little team though just plain that nice little stadium that you know that just hates that evil empire\nThe Boston Red Sox who will try to win their fourth championship in the last Fifteen Years\nOut spent every other team what's do that again the Boston Red Sox outspent every other team this year with the payroll roughly two hundred and thirty million dollars talked about an evil rich empire the Boston or Yankees Red Sox what do you have to say about that do Goldman\nYou know manipulation I mean every year it changes who spent the most it depends upon who's contracts are ending when last year it was the Dodgers two years ago it was the Yankees this year it's the red Sox they're all big market teams they all have a lot\nAnd trucks are ending when last year it was the Dodgers two years ago it was the Yankees this year it's the red Sox they're all big market teams they all have a lot of money\nThey're all spending money\nUm you know take either one in terms of who's the evil empire\nOh we have moral equivalency are you going to be able to walk out of the studio today world potency was in the evil empire Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and who is the Richard spends the more money to eat\nWell morally speaking the Yankees are still the evil empire I mean they have a history of evil that goes far far back so I Can't quite catch up to ... oh I think\nThey can let's turn to another part of the article history to remember and forget\nThe Dodgers were the first team to integrate with their landmark promotion of Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn in Nineteen forty seven the red Sox who held a sham and try out for Robinson in Nineteen forty five were the last with pumps the green in Nineteen fifty nine how 'bout that\nWell because the red Sox for the most racist team the Yankees by the way we're very close behind them and a\nYankees executive George Weiss with the one who said\nUm well uh we don't want to a black player because um our west Chester fans don't want the N. word folks you know out on the field in front of them so real yes so there was there was racism or there was an auto racing games and and the and the idea is to our weather worst\nThere's no doubt about it they were the last to integrate and that's partly why they were such terrible team in the Nineteen fifties\nRight and the Yankees are were late to bringing African Americans to the major leagues but Elson Howard of course was a tremendous baseball player and was in some ways the face of the Yankees along with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra and then I\nThink he was he was a great ballplayer supposedly Casey Stengel said essentially we finally got a black player and he didn't use the term black um and he can't run\nA really yes who so there was a lot of ugliness a lot of Oakland is a lot of oh enough yeah\nLet me ask you this on a more upbeat note here's also from the piece today in the times this World Series has the first to minority managers how score from Puerto Rico\nAnd Dave Robertson born in Japan to Japanese mother and an African American father only two other teams have minority managers I guess the end of the anger at all but here in this World Series to managers from minority groups and both\nManagers played during their careers for the Dodgers and\nThey pay for the other team yeah and in fact the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers is a hero in Boston okay I'm going to call underneath the table now and All right go ahead tell the story of Alex ... go ahead do it but make it quick please mean day Rob a day where I was I'm Sorry well\nDay Robert was the man who stole the base against Mariano Rivera\n... four of the two thousand and four playoffs when the red Sox were behind three to nothing and in the ninth inning when he barely buy up a finger stole second base event scored the tying run in the ninth inning which then led to the red Sox not only winning game for about\nFive six and seven and correct and then following that the world series correct the\nFirst time in eighty six years so they Roberts is still even though you know he was a late season acquisition he was a relatively seldom you substitute a pinch runner in that game he is a hero in Red Sox nation\nSo let me go through a bit more of this history with you and get your perspective do Goldman number of savor the side of American baseball researchers baseball historian this is a piece of since you've just tortured me with the memories of the stolen\nBase against Mariano Rivera and the red Sox coming back and breaking the curse of the band being oh\nLet me read you this last graph if I might quote the only player with two thousand advance for both teams is bill ... is a bill Wagner oh I'm ... and feel better already built Butner who homeward\nFor the Dodgers in the Nineteen Seventy four will series and it was such a valued member of the Nineteen eighty six Red Sox the manager John McNamara left him in at first base in the bottom of the tenth inning of game six against the Mets\nSo that button there could be on the field when the red Sox won at all parentheses this plan did not\nWork out you know it did not um being that I Am a Mets fan I was very happy to oh\nYes I'm Sorry and their salaries but I think the joy and you're a Mets fan because because I grew up in New York\nWhen I was seven years old a miracle Nineteen sixty and I met one of the world series I became a Mets fan in New York you really can only root for one team you have to be against the other hand I became a Mets fan\nAnd Joan holiday you know making the point before we went on the air John holidays in Vermont Monti\nToday that this is not the only city where if there are two teams you have to take a side\nYeah you have to pick in in Illinois you're either a cubs fan or you are a White Sox fan but there are people who are cardinals fans to yes in Illinois which I find really weird\nWell because you're getting pretty close to they are pretty close in St Louis I've\nBeen in St Louis on the cubs were coming into town and there were a ton of cardinals fans visiting there so they they go to each other's ballparks and on the current events are actually very well behaved the cubs fans are not\nNo they're not as\nWell let's look at one more piece before we take our break and then we're going to come back and talk about one of the players from Los Angeles who Boston fans love to hate but first\nWe would be remiss if we did not invoke the name of Babe Ruth mentioned as follows Babe Ruth parentheses this is after all the New York times inferences he's\nGot to say they are doing pretty well at differentiating between their reporting and their editorializing not perfect but pretty well they're not perfect\nThey perpetuated the myth of the curse of the band being and when they said that uh uh the red Sox traded Ruth in order to fund no no no net\nOkay well here they go again that was wrong because no no no that was five\nYears after it was all well let's hear that let's hear what they report today they being the New York times this is the one hundredth anniversary of the red Sox third and last World Series title with\nBabe Ruth correct it is also the first time the Dodgers and the red Sox have met in the world series since Nineteen sixty Ruth pitch to fourteen an incomplete game in game to which the red Sox won on their way to the title but about a year after the Nineteen Eighteen World Series\nHarry crazy the red Sox owner and a theatrical producers sold rooster the Yankees to raise money to produce the musical known and that and that's what an accurate\nThis transaction was said to be a disaster for Boston baseball but it gave the world tea for two and the Yankees a legend and you say part of that is wrong what we did give the Yankees the legend of it did\nBut Harry frizzy did not uh get no no no net onto Broadway until Nineteen twenty five\nWell it takes time you have to take them that much time you know that that's\nKind of you know condensed and it's just distorted and you know I'm at the time a lot of the commentators were saying that Babe Ruth was a cancer on a team and good riddance to him and you know he had had a great year in Nineteen Nineteen ... he was getting rid of ballplayers he was having battles with\nRuth was a cancer on a team and good riddance to him and you know he had had a great year in Nineteen Nineteen

U. mail is one of those premium business model voicemail services where you are able to have basic services for free on fancy stuff you pay and they have\nA steadily continually updated the list of scam numbers and when you have you mail if there's one that they know to be a likely scam call it pops up that way and they will do for the call where it will never go through to you\nAnd it won't awhile but people to leave a voicemail in many circumstances well vein with the database of people who use you mail they're able to track the source of calls coming in and their most recent report just released\nFinds that nearly four out of ten phone calls\nThat we received now or from scammers nearly four out of ten\nAnother one in five or from telemarketers\nSo between those two\nYou've got closing in on two thirds of phone calls that were receiving or junk phone calls of some kind and more likely to be from scammers than they are from just regular old sales people trying to reach us so\nConsider following my rule it's a simple rule\nIf I don't recognize the number is being from someone I Know I Do not answer the call just before I went on the air today I had a phone call come in but said it was from bank of America\nAnd I don't do business with bank of America I knew that it was it was a pretext thing called a fake call and I didn't answer but what if I was a customer a bank of America\nAnd I see that come up on caller i._d. I might be more likely to answer right well if you're a bank or whoever actually needed to talk to you\nThey're going to leave you a voicemail and then never called back from the number left in that voicemail call the number that you know to be the financial institution because even when it's a place you do business with\nThe caller may be phony this situation they're calling you about\nMaybe a con\nAnd don't get taken you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nResults made very not a solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes have not found your returns the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one called to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nYou know it's been a long time anyway so\nThose things how I drive you'd think that would be how will be determine what I'm going to pay the tax credit score is going to be giant with many insurers and the ZIP Code a little giant so for you\nShopping around where you already know what kind of driver you are you just need to quote the same level of coverage is that you have now and by the way raise that to a doctor but when you go to shop typically do a thousand dollars\nYou may say hey what am I going to do I don't have a thousand dollars or something goes wrong well here's the thing you make small claims on auto insurance\nYou now have a mark of shame that makes it difficult for you to shop around and is likely to lead to big increases in their premiums you pay with who you're then stuck with\nSo you want to use auto insurance when you got something relatively bigger that you have to deal with not something relatively small\nBecause they'll burn you when you make that small claim it's worse even with homeowner's insurance but you raise that the doctor bill and if you\nHave a lot of assets you own your home free and clear which like a third of people do you've got things that are of value\nJoan cheap out on liability coverage when you decided to get quotes make sure you have a decent amount of liability coverage because\nPeople see those billboards people see those TV ads people see those signs on the side of buses\nThat you have won the lottery you might not ... you don't have to worry about winning the big game the mega millions you just have to be in an accident that you've got somebody you can go sue\nWe're a sue happy country\nI was on the west coast of Florida recently and there was this billboard of this person's smiling who'd been inherent in an accident and the billboard the person talking about how some lawyer got um six hundred sixty thousand dollars and they're smiling ear to ear people out there like\nThat so make sure that if you got stuff you've got enough liability insurance if you got a lotta stuff meaning money\nAnd yelling stuff free and clear you want to look into an umbrella which sits on top of your regular coverage\nAs additional liability very cheap to buy for what you get sold in increments of one million dollars of additional protection for you in the event somebody is able to hold you responsible for something that went wrong\nAnd their lives and they don't have to\nNecessarily show that you're at fault they just have to convince the insurance company is not worth their time to defend you and they just start handing out checks\nJason joined us on the car coward show Hi Jason\nHey clerk how're ya great thank you Jason you've got money hanging out all over the place\nI I Do and I need some help them to know what to do with it\nAll right let me see if I can help these are good problem sad by the way\nYes sir what's though I've got I've got a I've got two different for on cake out I'm from two different companies I work for the past um\nOne is currently sitting about Eighteen thousand and some change and the other one around seven thousand um of course I no longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a four one K. so I guess the question is what do I deal with this money to ...\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were\nThose big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with the Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with the smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nWhere the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue\nAnd that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out quickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers\nFor having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you something do not call the\nAdministrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do\nIs they would serve track thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you ... and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six\nThe check they send you ... and send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then you recommend an IRA or the Ross IRA I'm no you can't ... I just I hear you talk about now that it's\nAll right so the story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill does all that money that was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money\nNot a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money from the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year\nOr you just know you got money that's their that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on some day\nNow let's talk about the other one the seven thousand\nIs down in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo is a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... through great question so let's say let's keep the simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple um move both of 'em to vanguard in an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case because if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you don't have the twenty five to grow in the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions you may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these days that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nYes or a wife and I

of these that will\nProvide you with\nGasoline fill up where you are\nInstead of you having to go to the gas station 'cause there just aren't very many of those out\nThere and I get it a lot of women

and are each of you putting in enough contribution to get whatever match there might be on the retirement plan\nThat plus the additional yes\nSo you're not doing Roth IRAs I Would guess\nNo no we are not vat and now the other option right we were trying to explore\n'cause the Roth is what I Would do next because okay if you do the raw\nIt has such innate built in tax advantages and then also has the flexibility in the event you had\nA financial catastrophe like the job loss and not enough money coming in or whatever so with the raw you can put in with maximum flexibility zero dollars in a year\nUp to fifty five hundred each end of the ...\nThe beauty of the Ross is even though you don't get any tax break putting money in the money in it grows tax free and if left alone into retirement\nSpent tax free so it's some youthful mix with the four oh one K. you're doing and she's probably doing it for three B that those are both pre tax things the Roth gives you a post tax pile of money\nAnd so having in retirement a pre tax pile of cash in a post tax pile of cash allows you to do proper planning with where here next dollar should come from where you manage your tax bill in

for a long time for at least\nI'm doing fine how are you good thank you Larry you want to ask you\nAbout something that ah that I have been into for a long time for at least oh how many years now at least twelve years and that solar\nRight ... what are you thinking of doing Larry\nWell I I just started looking into it and I'm thinking about doing solar for residential house and I'm trying to compare the options of the ... you know the payback time they say they're your trigger say it's about nine years and whether it's worth it or whether it helps the resale value of your house and to finance is whether it's\nEasier to pay cash or to use one of the suppliers or money or they'll supply to the interest rate or just an information of that nature\nYeah so whether you're buying so or will automatically pay off for you\nIs and I know and it's hard to say for sure I've done it just because I Believe that it's part of our future and I was willing in spite of how cheap I Am with things that involve the energy\nI'm really willing to put my wallet to work even if I don't get the pay back so I'm a part isn't in that area\nSo when I install solar\nPanels were much less efficient than they are now and they cost more than they do now so hey the numbers are far more favorable to you putting solar\nThen it was when I put in software last decade\nSo a dress because the numbers are much more favorable doesn't mean it's going to pay off for you because the questions that come up is ah what kind of good southern exposure do you have you have a road when your house\nTo house faces west a nurse who cable roof is facing directly south and I had one representative come look and he said yeah that's okay so are\nYou okay you want more than one\nThat's the end of the most important thing I've learned about solar is that you get multiple quotes and most people feel comfortable once they've gotten two or three was so or if there are let's say five active\nSo we're insulation companies in your area I Want you to get quotes from all five\nBecause you're learning things just through talking with the sales people\nAnd you don't want to just let them go look at your property and give you a written quote you want to walk the property with um you want to be talking to him you want to learn how they decide where to place how they decide if your property is um an efficient enough one and ... and\nAt the U.S department of energy website you should be able to find in a information\nAbout how to him or\nHow to figure out your payback not based on what they tell you but what you were able to see for yourself\nAnd where's that website and\nI'm trying to remember if it's on Energy Star dot Gov or energy dot Gov a producer Joel was checking right now while we're talking on the issue of paying for it if you're in a position to pay cash\nPay cash and just be done with it you're going to get thirty percent of that back as a federal tax credit with your next federal tax return right\nNow and as far as whether it increases the value of your home or not when you go to sell it\nIt depends whether in the area you live\nThere's a culture of installing solar if there is then people ascribe value\nTo you having solar on your house and the only study done was done out west that found that the average installer so we're led to Seventeen thousand dollar increase in the value of the home\nUh-huh\nBut if nobody around you does so were they may not see the value in it so you would have to make your own case with what your utility bills are\nRight well I live in the southeast interest emerging air as far as I can tell there's a few houses and in this neighborhood that had already\nAnd huge hardly any of your neighbors to get any sense of power bills before and after\nNot yet I'm going to the guy wants to talk to wasn't home and I tried but like you mentioned I'm just starting this process\nSo I Will event world to him yeah All right so the more research you do the more ... comfortable you'll be with the decision you make ... and it I mean one of those things not to do impulsively\nUh yeah [laughter] for sure [laughter] have you got to pay back on years I Know you say you had an older sister but is is it\nTo where you're happy with it well for like you thought it would\nIt's it's better than I thought it would be and we're seeing really really nice reduction and power bill but it's going to take me I'm even with the credit it's going to take me and its energy dot com where you find the guide to going solar\nOK I'm it's going to take me it looks like fourteen years to get paid back\n\nYou know have you talked to anybody who's done this recently and then their payback time over there escalated faith\nI Know yeah I don't know how often people actually\nFigure it out\nYou know I don't know there there are people I'm sure that are that are really numbers oriented that really do thorough research a lot of times what people do is they they know are they live in a part of the country that that is suitable for solar and they install a system they get back there thirty percent\nAnd they're really comfortable with what they save on bills every month but that's more subjective than objective\nAnd that's why you want to look at this energy guide see if you can figure out what kind of payback you'd have where you live in the southeast I can tell you for me what's great\nIs writing a very small checker no check at all from my power bill in a month\nIs fantastic and is it\n... is with us up welcome to the car coward show hey Hi how you

well I don't know what I'm going to say and stuck it out one\nImmediately after the debate Baker said he misspelled and that he would vote for a deal it was challenging Senator Elizabeth Warren

Newman WHM see news information ...\nWelcome to the show and we welcome back to the show and to the studio representative Aaron Vega Aaron Vega is representative from\nHolyoke that's one of the ... about a half a dozen cities that have their own representative in the general court the legislature of Massachusetts\nHe is going into his fourth permanent completing his certain prior to being a representative from Holyoke with a representative from Holyoke is city councilor in the city of and for the city of Holyoke for some for years\nI'd like to talk to you about two different topics today representative Vegas one is I Want to talk to you about politics both state and local and I'd like to talk to you about some of the substance of work that the legislature did not complete\nAt last term and I'd like to know a session and I'd like to know what you think will happen with those really pressing issues beginning this next session but let's start with politics and we were talking yesterday about the governor's race\nAnd I said and after I said I said this is kind of right so the J Gonzales the Democratic nominee for governor is actually would actually make a really good governor he's very experienced is very level headed he's got good policy smarty understands the inter connectedness of governmental agencies in policies and budgets\nBut I think he's not a very good candidates and therefore the odds of him actually an seating governor Charlie breakers seem really remote at this point at this point and I would appreciate your perspective as a long time and lifelong Democrat [laughter]\nGood morning good to be here um yeah I think it's always something that we talk about um whenever people close to me and said they want to run for office I was there was two jobs you're actually going for ones being the candidate and one's actually be a legislator and they're very different\nUm and unfortunately especially in this world now I mean if you're going to be in campaign mode as a kid but you got to inspire people you've got to speak well you've got to look ... you've got to do all this other stuff that doesn't necessarily relate to the actual job\nAnd you're right I think Jay I mean he was in a secretary has been in health care and administration and financial nutrition science underdeveloped veteran new ballparks or or get a great job did a great job so you understand the budget I went to see them or talk about the budget I mean he has some great ideas like you're right about the policies\nI Would like to see more substantial way as well how we're going to pay for stuff I'm One of his plans so I think he's great I met him many times are we start done many times\nBut um I think given that you have some struggles with the campaign I also think the state party hasn't stepped up I'm outside democratic parties having stepped into kind of help out because Charlie bakers got Seventy two percent approval rating and so it was a little bit worn right\nAnd people look at that and potential donors look at that and say why am I going to spend money on a campaign that has very little chance of being successful and of course though fewer dollars to come into a campaign right is a little bit like a that a water going down the drain which is\nThe more people with fewer people support the campaign that fewer people will support the

represented we were talking about how Charlie\nBaker has managed to keep this image and foster this image of a traditional Republican the fiscally conservative a but still socially a liberal\nRepublican as a kind of ... Jacob Javits of years ago\nUm the salt and stalls perhaps\nBut a lot of that is not because Charlie Baker is so traditionally Republican but because as you pointed out while we were talking during the break he's managed to foster this image of having a distance from Donald Trump which is paying enormous dividends for him politically you explain that a bit force\nWhile I think what he's able to do if you said it's just it's just sort of come out and say you know I mean I'm In favor of marriage equality I'm In favor of which he writes I have people in my family so again\nConnecting to voters and call out you know what President Trump has been doing 'em and calling it out as not part of his party in Colorado's extreme recall it out as somebody who doesn't agree with and said he wasn't going to vote for him and stuff like that of course this was back for a little bit now if you voted down the ticket and voting for Bill\nWho's a Trump million and if you will running against it was only going to war and so that's getting him a little bit hot water but he's again he's trying to come back to yeah I'm a traditional Republican uh\nAnd I'll support the Trump peace to a candidate for Senate if I have to but then I'm going to walk back so you kind of no I don't\nReally believe it was launched ... exactly so you know but then this time right now where\nI mean the Republican Party is in this you know split I mean in Massachusetts right Scott Lively still give twenty percent of the votes and the Republican primary Rosen primary right I mean in in ... being the far right All right famous mostly famous for his supporters to kill the gays bill gone to an ... so\nSo if you did was just some of them if you do here they were so big and there was I think that this dream party I'm not that guy I Know I Want to get things done and he uses a lot of send messages that come out of the legislature like from speaking to Leo of\nHey we're not do you see we get things done bipartisan right it might be only thirty three Republicans in a hundred and twenty seven Democrats but let me get plenty of their votes we can say it's by ... and there's like five or seven\nRepublicans in the Senate but if you get for their votes it's only bipartisan so he's able to say as his leadership to say we're not Washington we get things done and we do a bipartisan way\nWell let's talk about some of that bipartisanship and the legislature and specifically whether or not the legislature is going to get things done\nBecause at the end of the last session there were major pieces of legislation that did not move major policy questions before the legislature that have not been resolved and I like to address at least two of them if we can do today one has healthcare because\nHealthcare now takes ... a forty to forty four percent of the Massachusetts state budget and coming to grips with health care costs in coverage is enormously important issue this was an issue that representative coke was devoted to trying to\nThe average is enormously important issue this was an issue that representative coke I missed was devoted to trying to solve and of course is death and as it was is is not only sad for so many reasons but includes the one that we've lost his expertise on health\nCare if they go and see what's going to happen with health care and the legislature this next session well it has to happen\nSomething has to have I mean so it is it continues to be a priority or there's already been statements of leadership saying that health care will be a prayer for next session\nBut I think the thing is is that again with two hundred elected a hundred and sixty wraps him for his senators\nGetting consensus a special on health care is not the easiest thing especially in my opinion when you put together is on the bus bills that have so much in it I mean the Senate bill basically wanted to rewrite healthcare again I'm not saying it's good or bad but that's basically what it was doing that so much in there\nThe house every riding his Romneycare revising the Romneycare if you will exactly and of course the house version as there's always the case was was much more conservative and smaller and scope um but also the issue that we've dealt with some of the big issues in a totally different way\nThe one issue for me on the health care is priced variants I mean that's that's just what price variants what's that the fact that private insurers\nWhen they create a contract with Boston medical and they will then pay twenty two thousand dollars for a hip replacement\nAnd then when they can finally come over to her medical center and we obviously have a much smaller private pay base they can say well you know we're only going to be twelve thousand dollars for a hip replacement that much of a disparity that did wonders you mean if one of your medium this Fifteen hospitals below point nine\nAnd Boston medical and children's get one point nine two\nTimes what the ... middle price it was a metal prices said talking about almost ... almost twice as much reimbursement for cause it's the same procedure then he's got Blue Cross Blue Shield\nComing around and saying oh colonoscopy don't quote me on the numbers exactly but we're gonna pay five Seventy\nThey've come up with that I Know and I know I got out of the ... [laughter] rather than pay five seven and a\nGood Dickinson who's part of a bigger bigger on both\nBecause clearly Dickinson is part of Mass General and therefore Mass General has some negotiating\nPatterns I got it and then they come to Holyoke again and say we're going to give you three hundred and eighty bucks but at the same procedure in the same area then\nCause Fifteen miles away but it you only reimbursed and then the top off and on lessons that\nThen Blue Cross Blue Shield sends a letter to her medical and say we realize that there's been an issue with the price without reimbursement rates were not committed to giving you six dollars more for the next four years [noise] so [noise]\nLess than twenty dollars over for your reimburse with him and get us closer so low priced variance issue so when we want to do is create a minimum wage for hospitals to notice you get paid more or less than point nine so they have to get every one of the Fifteen hospitals that are below get 'em up two point nine within\nTwo mayors that's Ninety percent of other other\nMedium Ninety percent of the medium thank you and that would probably put a cap on the ceiling 'cause that's what insurance companies want up say they couldn't increase their rates more than two and a half percent over the next five years or maybe tied to the judge the increases right 'cause that's the whole thing\nThe insurance companies threaten the G. I. C. increases being the state the state health insurance plan okay I'm Sorry\nI'm that they're saying oh well we turn around and give her medical center point nine and a Ninety percent of the of the medium run up to go in Greece rates over here which is not true it's a sixty seven million dollar fix to bring Fifteen hospitals up to the up to a level that gives them sustainable\nFor insurance companies and their world fifty seven million dollars\nStopped taking first class flights and drinking water and you'll be fine\nThere are obviously many issues involved in the health care and this is one of them and we could spend the rest of our time for sure talking about health care about it I Would like to get your perspective on another major issue for the legislature which is the education uh funding you know across the commonwealth\nAgain an issue that died in the legislature and died but it didn't get it through the legislature last session it will be back because the funding formula is critical critics in cities and towns across Massachusetts how's that going to work out or what should work out and your judgment\nAnd I would say two things I mean we have an education you almost have three sections ready to early education then of course elementary and secondary and so I'm middle school and high school and then higher ed but focusing on high school or high school and elementary with the chapter Seventy funding that's where education funding comes from the state to our cities and towns\nAround chapter Seventy chapter Seventy the general laws and that's where the funding that that was crazy formulas comes out among other things chapter Seventy yes so the rub is supposed to be that this supposed to supposed to the great\nYou've always wanted to sound like and here to help us all sound authoritative\nWe have to Goldman Northampton resident a member of savor the society of American baseball researchers a baseball historian\nWho has much to share with us and so I Would like to go through some of these pieces that are in the times today\nThis under the ... page that is facing the cheat sheet itself doesn't get any better to clubs rich and history and cash collide\nAnd I'd like your perspective as we go through this to Goldman reading your dateline Boston there'll be no underdogs than a hundred and fourteen ths World Series which opens at Fenway Park today\nThe west Angeles Dodgers have gone three decades without a title but have spent about one point four billion in salaries to claim elastic nationally west crowns the Boston Red Sox you know that quaint little team the just plain that nice little stadium that you know that just hates that evil empire\nThe Boston Red Sox who will try to win their fourth championship in the last Fifteen Years out spent every other team let's do that again\nThe Boston Red Sox outspent every other team this year with the payroll roughly two hundred and thirty million dollars talked about an evil rich empire the Boston or Yankees Red Sox\nWhat do you have to say about that do Goldman\nOr you know manipulations I mean every year it changes who spent the most it depends upon who's contracts are ending when last year it was the Dodgers two years ago it was the Yankees this year the red Sox they're all big market teams they all have a lot of money they're all spending money\nUm you know take either one in terms of who's the evil empire\nOoh we have moral equivalency are you going to be able to walk out of the studio today world fluency was in the evil empire Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and who is the richer spins the more money to eat\nWell morally speaking the Yankees are still the evil empire I mean they have a history of evil that goes far far\nBack so I Can't quite catch up to ... oh I think\nThey can let's turn to another part of the article history to remember and forget\nThe Dodgers were the first team to integrate with their landmark promotion of Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn in Nineteen forty seven the red Sox who held a sham and try out for Robinson in Nineteen forty five were the last was pumped see green in Nineteen fifty nine how 'bout that\nWell because the red Sox were the most racist team Yankees by the way we're very close behind them and a\nYankees executive George Weiss with the one who said\nUm well uh we don't want to a black player 'cause I'm a Westchester fans don't want the N. word folks you know out on the field in front of them so real yes so there was there was racism or there was an auto racing games and the and and the and the idea is to are what are the worst\nThere's no doubt about it they were the last to integrate and that's partly why they were such a terrible team in the Nineteen fifties\nRight and the Yankees uh were late to bringing African Americans to the major leagues but Elson Howard of course was a tremendous baseball player and was in some ways the face of the Yankees along with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra and then\nHe was he was a great ballplayer supposedly Casey Stengel said essentially we finally got a black player and he didn't use the term black um and he can't run a really yes who so there was a lot of ugliness\nA lot of ugliness a lot of oh enough yeah\nLet me ask you this on a more upbeat note here's also from the piece today in the times this World Series has the first to minority managers how score from Puerto Rico\nAnd David Robertson born in Japan Japanese mother in an African American father only two other teams have minority managers I guess the end and the anger at all but here in this World Series to managers from minority groups\nAnd the votes managers played during their careers for the Dodgers and they pay\nFor the other team yeah and in fact the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers is a hero in Boston okay I'm going to crawl underneath the table now and All right go ahead tell the story of Alex ... go ahead do it but make it quick\nPlease mean day Rob a day where I was I'm Sorry well day Robert was the man who stole the base against Mariano Rivera ... for the two thousand and four playoffs when the red Sox were behind three to nothing and in the ninth inning\nWhen he barely buy up a finger stole second base event scored the tying run in the ninth inning which then led to the red Sox not only winning game for about\nFive six and seven and correct and then following that\nThe world series correct the\nFirst time in eighty six years so they Roberts is still even though you know he was a late season acquisition he was a relatively sell them you've substituted pinch runner in that game he is a hero in Red Sox nation\nSo let me go through a bit more of this history with you and get your perspective do Goldman member of savor the side of American baseball researchers baseball historian this is a piece of since you've just tortured me with the memories of the stolen base\nAgainst Mariano Rivera and the red Sox coming back and breaking the curse of the band being oh\nLet me read you this list graph if I might quote the only player with two thousand bats for both teams is bill ... is oh ville Wagner oh I'm beginning to feel better already bill Butner who ...\nFor the Dodgers in the Nineteen Seventy four will series and was such a valued member of the Nineteen eighty six Red Sox the manager John McNamara left him in at first base in the bottom of the tenth inning of game six against the mess\nSo that button there could be on the field when the red Sox won at all parentheses this plant that don't work out you\nKnow it did not um being that I Am a Mets fan I was very happy\nThat Oh yes I'm Sorry and they always areas are writing the joy and you're a Mets fan because because\nI grew up in New York when I was seven years old a miracle Nineteen sixty nine minutes when the world series I became a Mets fan in New York you really can\nOnly root for one team you have to be against the other and became a Mets fan\nAnd Joan holiday you were making the point before we went on the air during holidays in Vermont you belong to you\nToday that this is not the only city where if there are two teams you have to take a side\nYeah you have to pick in in Illinois you're either a cubs fan or you are a White Sox fan but there are people who are cardinals fans to yes in Illinois which I find really weird\nWell because you're getting pretty close to they are pretty close in St Louis I've been in St Louis on the cubs were coming into town and there were a ton of cardinals fans visiting there so they they go to each other's ballparks and on the colonel fans are actually very well behaved the cubs fans are not no they're not as\nWell let's look at one more piece before we take our break and then we're going to come back and talk about one of the players from Los Angeles who Boston fans love to hate but first we would be remiss if we did not invoke the ...\nAbout one of the players from Los Angeles who Boston fans love to hate but first\nWe would be remiss if we did not invoke the name\nOf Babe Ruth mentioned as follows Babe Ruth parentheses this is after all the New York times and for instance if you got to say they are doing pretty well at differentiating between their reporting and their editorializing not perfect but pretty well they're not\nPerfect they perpetuated the myth of the curse of the band being and when they said that uh uh the red Sox traded Ruth in order to fund no no no net\nOkay well here they go again that was wrong because no no no no it was five years after\nIt was oh well let's hear that well let's hear what they report today they being the New York times this is the one hundredth anniversary of the red Sox third and last World Series title with\nBabe Ruth correct it is also the first time the Dodgers and the red Sox have met in the world series since Nineteen sixty Ruth pitched to fourteen an incomplete game in game to which the red Sox won on their way to the title but about a year after the Nineteen Eighteen World Series\nHarry crazy the red Sox owner and a theatrical producers sold roof to the Yankees to raise money to produce the musical no no no net and that's what it's inaccurate\nThis transaction was said to be a disaster for Boston baseball but it gave the world tea for two and the Yankees a legend and you say part of that is wrong what would they did give the Yankees the legend\nOr they did but Harry frizzy did not a good no no no net onto Broadway until Nineteen twenty five\n... takes time you have to take that much time you know if that\nCan you know condensed in it distorted and\nYou know I'm at the time a lot of the commentators were saying that Babe Ruth was a cancer on the team and good riddance to him and you know you had had a great year in Nineteen Nineteen ... he was getting rid of ballplayers he was having battles with van Johnson the president of the American league at the time was trying to force them out of the league\nAnd so he was selling players but not in order to finance no no no not\nBe an expert or at least be able to fake it the world series begins tonight we'll continue our conversation with do Goldman right after this\n[noise]\nThis is bill new and\nYou're listening to this morning's nine o'clock show with Bill Newman WHM Pete news information and the arts\nThere's this thing called six word memoirs life
