window\nBlind to have you with me and go and take your phone calls and emails at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nI also mentioned a federal judge in Tennessee who issued a a a ruling involving three hundred thousand drivers in Tennessee who've racked up enough traffic tickets in their driving the the state literally said we're suspending your license\nAnd this judge it made no sense to me but the judge said\nIf the people who got those tickets cannot a reasonably afford to pay them you can't take their

program working hard to be changed in the United way at U. W. Hampshire got or can they can get to change your child's life\nThis is the Lars Larson show\nOne o seven you may be [noise]\n\nYou\nGet moved by welcome back Lawrence large when Joe over the last couple of years we've talked a lot about\nThe opioid crisis and I've done my best to try to give you straight data because we now know that about Seventy two thousand people every year and the United states over does and the overdose because of opioids but we're actually lumping to problems together\nAre based on the numbers I've been able to find about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand died because of abuse of of pharmaceutical drugs the kind of come from a legitimate companies\nAre and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs like heroin\nThat comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick malls on who's a former special agent in charge us a sea of the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration in the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not in vain a dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you great to be on the program\nI'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody\nMy family at least that I'm aware of who's had that but I I Know of some you know for some folks I'm acquainted with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not invading his new documentary\nAbout this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the da says it about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only of public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels that adopted poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right\nThere's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now that they asked majority is being killed from the mixtures of this pope and sent than all the synthetic\nA drug coming right from China and the labs and China endemic to get with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that can dictate on heroin it's a college kid that things taken an adult pill is going to keep 'em alert in this in ... in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills are mixed with pencil and by the way\nFor the view is one kilogram offensive at all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams affected all to kill an adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because you know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah they're tapping\nInto the criminal networks to their funding and their resources we had a case a couple of years ago well I'm an ... two hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs debt is a\nYou know caught kelp you know so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rakes was Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl who had very much you loved her family passion polite typical kid\nYou know playing sports you of the capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds it that\nBecause she got a ticket and then she went out\nOn to you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in\nThe particular you know packages she she bought but the point is is they don't know what that Getty and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train candidate that are actually caring about quality control they care about making money and grow in their business and the price and the scary part\nLarge just the fact that China\nIs developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country at China is a communist country so\nA large is the fact that China\nIs developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know them by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple facets of this problem\nDarren I'm Talking to dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the dia de da\nDe ... take the kind of efforts that that this country does to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seems like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you point out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China are a lot of these chemicals to not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what\nThe controlled substances are so you know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently what China\nTo try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not\nIt's nothing to brag about I mean the pope the politics the politicians will make like everything's moving down to write at but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they're not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but you know and your listeners know\nThat China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know they're ... they're still in our identities that going after a financial grades and I lecture grits so you know\nDumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans\nSo this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on\nYou know who in China is actually standing at all well\nBecause I think about what they accomplish if they can manufacture drugs cheaply and the ... the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash\nFrom producing new stuff flows back into China one way or the other which is good for China because ... and the soup financially so they they get to ... to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win\nI call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just\nIn it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and there's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects\nOf the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections that drug distribution stash houses you know building compartments these guys all over our country\nA and honestly we got a shutdown that dam water\nThat we want to really make a difference but stuck at the military and Bob ... my opinion\nMy opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website department of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that order\nAnd knock this nonsense off with this with the politics you know if you look at nine eleven\nThe Iraq War the Afghanistan war you add up every one that died and then he'd been in the Vietnam War\nIt still west at how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public and to realize the wake up stop listening at these phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocket books in their wallets and if you choose they're not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain to brand new documentary out Derek molds is very involved and Derek thank you for your work at the ... you know that's a dangerous in tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time tonight\nOf white supremacy in our country I mean it went on and on this whole segment like I say it was premeditated none of the rest of the segment made sense if the quote had been accurate that Trump had said it's a scary time for\nYoung men um only if you lie and insert old white men in there do you bring on um you know professor of urban studies and and host of the BEP network to talk about white supremacy I'm halfway through the segment and like a rare a switch true why from\nSomething we made up in the back room here at CNN to\nAn actual Trump strategy\nAsking will this Trump's strategy work uh it's really absolutely outrageous and and my notes to readers and I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it and print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news um these are the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there\nIs a typo no this was a deliberate vicious racists lie about the president not only was it not corrected I'm In that segments if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break\n'em and you know come up with something different to talk about as far as I notice never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after\n'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out as they tweet I'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of what the error was it goes to her pathetic list of ... of of of of Twitter followers and as\nAs small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw\nHer segment with why then you know one to ... Twitter feed to see this vague I made an error how would a segment and correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy is they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing is if somebody can come out with a Finley evidence accusation that that\nHas nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing in the Persian bringing me\nYou know charge can't even remember all the details where where who how and that\nCan destroy a man or and as I pointed out in these ... times a man or a woman's or you know a a ... their entire career\nThey're good name their family wipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry it was a ... it was a false accusation or we think it was called but by this time you've already destroyed the person you use a scary time when that could that one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or you know\nThe one time you can be sure you're going to see it again is one Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which is why I Am and systems that he make it a man I'm every one thing so don't worry they won't be able to do anything with a woman yeah because you know they loved their tail and they love me you know this has come up with something new now that we know what their ... book is\nThey're not going to be able to pull the the the false allegation of a highschool groping on the next one it would be too embarrassing\nSo they'll have to do something slightly different and frankly you know you reminded me of you remember back when the ridicule was heaped on on Gerald Ford because Chevy Chase portrayed him as being incredibly clumsy and we knew if you look through the man's history he was an athlete he was the\nBall player at University of Michigan\nAnd I stand out he was a stand a football player who did very very well but if you have a comedian pretend that the president is a clumsy guy\nThan people today will say well you know you remember outcomes of George

use to make fun of Reagan saying oh Reagan imagine those things from the movies and then you'd go back and say no that was actually based on history is you're right we're pretending that things happen

decades ago\n... ... you know I mean I remember 'cause I'm an old guy but I don't even know I didn't even know somebody his age would even remember it\nBut but he's breathing this woman in the most

to cause a scene that's what they tried to do they actually train them to do this they train them\nIn state governments all around the country that also includes two suicides and all\nOn accusations of sexual misconduct now there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collect the connect the dots but\nThey have been weaponized saying this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats who are telling the the party line surprisingly\nYeah those are the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so some things very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along the bad people and you had some folds accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't they\nKnow they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned chew in Colorado you know there were two very suspicious cases won in Colorado won an Arizona\nSteve loves soccer in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't stay on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out scare the heck out of them and asked them to resign they were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a\nUm a day in which Democrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years\nNever had been an expulsion in Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said because my wife\nWas molested when she was Seventeen\nI'm going to vote yes on the expulsion of Steve ... now and now this is these are lawmakers who\nAre putting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process a long time ago\nWell in fact a lot of uh got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter of guidance that went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against say student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault\nThen put it into effectively a kangaroo court\nAh and in in those cases is interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think almost people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or a virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like\nLike a judge Kavanaugh had are now justice capital head so I just want to hear the odd for that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat almost instantaneous

all along\nAnd and in a heartbeat they had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans\nSo ... number one we cannot\nBuy in to this idea the left is\nBrilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notions and that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was it was stunning and riveting to hear I saw that video\nAnd and you've got lawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where when an ... person does something that you use a criminal assault in most communities merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today and just started shouting at them and screaming at them and I did it\nFor any length of time if there was a police officer within\nYou know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nThey oppose from and then we're saying but for everyone else there is a hard and fast you know kind of standard and we will we\nOpposed Trump and then we're

online and it can get more viewers than a World Series game video games are no longer a sub culture there are no longer just a little past time they are in many regards as big as Hollywood movies they're as big as professional sports\nThat's Andrew urban a critic and author who explores the past present and future of video games in his book bit by bit\nOh videogames transformed by world\nAnd he's right last year's televised championship of the game league of legends drew a staggering thirty six million viewers about Fifteen million more than watch the cubs beat the Indians in game seven of the world series\nAnd five million more than tuned into the decisive game seven of the NBA Finals urban says whether we all notice that are not video games have become as major and entertain been medium is anything else\nThere is an perhaps too easy parallel to draw with the history of cinema that's\nA useful analogy and it takes us pretty far but not all the way where the early days of cinema it was merely a technical achievement that cinema was great because all the sudden they're moving pictures and all of a sudden they're sound with them and then she there's color and all these different technical advances\nHelped people who are thinking in terms of artistry and self expression they started to use these tools to their advantage Orson Welles certainly didn't invent cinema but he revolutionized he demonstrated that it is a valid artistic platform or art form\nWe saw the same sort of development with video games where beginning at Nineteen fifty eight at a government lab on Long Island we had a game called tennis for to that by any definition today's is crude and\nFrankly boring but every generation added to the technical prowess at our fingertips\nOf course we're growing popularity video games have very famously been scored the game doom has been blamed for embolden ing the Columbine shooters in the months leading up to the massacre\nMore recently parenting groups have come out against games like call of duty and mortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence\nUrban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture indeed\nUrban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture needs directed with\nPeople don't understand that video games are just another form of expression there still seen as\nSomething other than what we're accustomed to from our storytelling media a large part of that I think has to do with the perception of video games as violent\nMost people when we think of video games we think of guns and militaristic shoot 'em ups first person shooter games and it's true that those are\nOften the most popular and best selling games every year\nJust as the most popular and bestselling films tend to be quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex\nThere are also the local art house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there are an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea across\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more than just violent he says there's so much more to the vast library of games than just first person shooters\nVideo games can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards us the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie and has brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles but there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual level and making us rethink the world and our own assumptions about it\nUrban says that it was a child in the Nineteen seventies the light bulb that video games to be more than just disposable entertainment wind off in his mind when he was just a kid\nIt's one of those experiences that right now we take for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it there is a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred and this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen that represented us as players\nAnd of course this is obvious now we have avatars in every game we play where all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we saw that I saw that was this little innocuous square on an Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor of the living room with the controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I I think it's true that Walt Whitman famously said I'm large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude and we are complex difficult creatures\nWith that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd as time has gone on bourbon says that experiences\nBecome even more engaging as the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kind of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing\nAnd I think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an interactivity to read and there's an interactivity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect that is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately like films before them video games and transcended their status as a technical achievement and become something more powerful\nThan general idea that I started with is Kevin video game be a work of art\nHas the definition of what we consider art broadened enough or had video games progressed enough as it medium that they've become artful\nAnd what I've discovered is that the ladder is certainly true that

the stories that even a sore throat might be blamed on a person's weight ... says many people seem to think fat shaming has value perhaps especially with the doctors doing\nThere seems to be this ongoing public perception that maybe wait bias or stigma not such a bad thing maybe it will motivate or incentivize people to lose weight\nWhen you look at the research on that we actually see that exactly the opposite is true that being a target of weight stigma or bowling or discrimination leads to a range of negative emotional and physical health consequences till we see that this increases

obesity in weight gain over time and we also see that this leads to heightened physiological stressed\nPeople actually kind of believe that shaming someone and I don't think that doctors intentionally mean to shame someone but that is the end result that's simply not an effective motivator and in fact it leads people to feel like well why should I take care of\nBut that is the end result that's simply not an effective motivator and in fact it leads people to feel like well why should I take care of myself I'm really not a very good person anyway and my doctor already assumes that I'm not doing what I should be doing\nStudies show that there are medical consequences as well\nPatients who perceive that they have been stigmatized about their weight by a doctor have less trust and that Dr\nThey tend to have really impaired treatment outcome for that for example they might not lose as much weight if they're trying to lose weight they're more likely to avoid future healthcare services like preventative health care services they're more likely to avoid future medical appointments and we also have the kind of from that providers find\nEvidence that doctors and they actually spend

desire to help these patients compared to our patients\nKatz says millions of patients simply quit going to the doctor rather than allow themselves to be judged visit after visit sometimes he says it has tragic consequences as it did with his own grandmother\nMy grandmother was obese throughout her adult life the doctors that she went to back in those days wag that admonishing finger every time and everything that was ever bothering her better health all she ever heard was lose weight which obviously she couldn't do if she could have lost the weight and kept it off she would have done that\nShe just stopped going to the doctor and tragically in her case\nShe developed breast cancer but wasn't being screened when she first presented with it it was very far advanced and she died very young a vet a static breast cancer that could have been caught early and treated if she'd been going to doctors routinely and specifically because of the harsh treatment for weight she didn't go\nSo what can medicine due to break the cycle cats in pools say it has to start in medical school my teaching would be doctors to be more aware of personal attitudes and biases and the causes of obesity or

I have a lot of that is Bermuda grass and I want to change it to\nTo a set of eat grass because it's getting bald spots in it and it does good and I had to go about doing that and I put that grass state now about the the\n... you can start to put some grass seed out now especially where you are it's it's a little bit warmer than we are are in the north here I personally wouldn't use the easy seed or one of the ...\nIt is here I personally wouldn't use the easy seed\nOr one of the reasons behind it is it's more of an annual grass so it's only one year so what you're putting down now is not going to come back next year is not going to it's not going to benefit you as much as you wouldn't want\nOK\nOkay and I know you have a Bermuda grass and Bermuda grass looks like nothing in the in the\nIn the winter it looks kind of like it's dead [noise] um so you're going to have some annual grass is going to be really greens than with this for me to grasp looking brown so it might look a little bit worse\nOr so if it was me if I'd want to take a a a grass seed that was more of a vast use and rise\nAt this time of year they do better in cooler weather once we start to turn into winter or those putting those down would really help you uh to establish a lawn at this point get rid of some of that drew me to grass she might have a little bit of green during the winter\n[noise] aiming cover those holes are you looking to just get rid of the Bermuda grass completely\nYes how are the temperatures there at night have you gotten into the thirties\nNot yet it's around fifty something now and then it's you know it's been struck trading Twain thick in sixty something like\nOkay well you still have a lot of time where if you wanted to you could spray something to to get rid of that grass that's there or to kill the lawn and start fresh or you could over seed a white makes more sense for you\nAt random overseas is that I wanted to wash away\nGot ya okay so what I Would do is get out there and rake the lawn clean up the lawn as much as I could to get rid of some of the dead grass some of the old grass that's in there she can kind of expose some of the the soil underneath it was that when you put the seed down\nIt actually is on the soil is not sitting on some of that batch or some of the other grass [laughter] okay it was also put down a starter fertilizer\nOr the start a fertilizer will help establish the root system for the winter for that graphic that grassy that you're putting down\nSo this is the process started wanting you do I want you to get out their break the law and clean the law and get it all any of that debt grasses and there are some of the ... out except for clean it up it's almost like a spring clean up and the lawn but you're doing it now she can expose the soil\nOkay then put down a starter fertilizer okay started fertilizer when you put it down it actually um is okay to walk on a it helps break it down and it goes a little bit quicker that way when you break it down\nOkay then put the seed down on top of it and then your router lending Ryan Fisk\nRyan fest used when you go into the cooler temperatures do a little bit better establishing themselves I Know you have fifties and sixties or is it looks like that way for you for a while so you could stick with\nUh some bluegrass is or some other types of grass as as well just based on your temperatures but if you started to see the temperatures get like they are up here in New England where their forties at night or some thirties that's\nWhen you would want to stick to ... and rise\nOkay it's really just based on temperatures years temperatures seem to be a little bit warmer so you could use a mixture of any of the grasses that you like\nSo that that could be really beneficial for you [noise] um [noise] other than that it's that it's watering is your biggest thing at this point in water until the ground really freezes and you have a great\nEstablished long

fifth step down which would be your fourth step a second time\nOh I I like to do five steps during the year that way you're getting a little bit more into the soil for spring so you're really following through that consistently\nOkay\nA one ... one of the things you could do just to help you in the future um if you'd like a one of our sponsors a\nNatural alternatives is a really good company and I'm not just saying it because of the product I'm saying it because of their customer service they'll actually walk you through the step process that you need in bulk hall you\nWhen it's time to put down the next ah application\nThey'll just give me a call and say hey Vinnie I'm we just noticed that uh it should be about time to put step to down or it should be time to step three down it's it's a really cool offering not a lot of companies out there will actually do that type of thing but they actually have a five um application process that I really like\nA that would really be beneficial for your ... early spring spring than a summer fall and winter um that might be a great way to do it or going forward but definitely uh the more steps they're like the five steps would be beneficial for you and your lawn\nOr anything like that name of that company again please yet it's called natural alternatives okay\nSo it's natural alternative dot com you can go to their website they have lots of information they're open Monday through friday on the phone number that they have on there as the eight hundred number yeah they actually want you to call\nThey want they want listeners of this show and anybody out there to give them a call to ask questions or that was one of the things when I when I\nStarted to take over the show I I I talk to everybody um you know not off the radio obviously and just said ... you know do you want people to call and they were like yeah that's actually part of our business that's what we want we want people to call us and ask us questions they have a lot of great stuff there the\nOther thing you could be doing many at this time of year just to help you know really what's going on in the soil\nIs or get a soil sample done a natural alternatives can do that as well for you the soil samples going to tell you what's going on underneath the the soil and what you can do fertilizer wise you know what do you need to do for why and what do you need to do except Sara and really help you to keep your success in the long going\nOn and I suggest you win at this time of year because that\nIn the spring everybody's getting soil samples so it can take two to three weeks or even more\nAn order to actually get your results now in the spring when you if you're waiting two to three weeks if you've got some time behind you and you're like you could have missed the step you could have missed something that type of thing\nThat's why I guess doing it now a best way to do a soil sample is take the lawn area the you know big rectangle do the four corners\nAnd then something in the middle you're looking to get about a pound for pound and a half of soil she just dig down with a shovel little travel gets some of the loose soil put it in a bag mix all you know four or five samples together and then that's how you would get the best soil sample from the area\nOh great matter of fact when I got to work today I'll\nGo on the computer check 'em out\nGreat ah hopefully those things those steps will help you I think it'll help just benefit you going forward you know\nPut in a lawn together takes a lot I can look at some of those those commercials that I ... I won't say the name of the company um but they're always green lawns and ah\nBut it that's after years of maintenance and taking care of it and going through that step process and consistently doing it and it sounds like you're on that right track to do that are so I think I think you could be a a\nYou know a good candidate to be on one of those commercials just or maybe not that company\nI understand I understand I didn't give him a try today when I get home great Vinnie thank you so much for the phone call thank you very much but a great help thank you enjoy the rest of your day to abide\nBy the phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six once again eight five five six six zero four to six one a Nathan's or anybody on the line\n\nNot at the moment that's all right we'll keep talking that's what I'm here for the answer some questions and ah help you guys out with your your your lawns your your evergreens et cetera the phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one again eight five five six six zero four to six one\nIt's one of the things I like to do before each show is go to old news letters to take a look at what my father was talking about this time of year I'm for previous years it's really cool stuff uh it\nIt helps me connect with my father even more than I was a so it's just you look at it and say oh yeah yeah that's what he was talking about okay great one of the things that are he's had in a few of the newsletter says the set\nTime of year to really get everything that you've been using for the guardian are ready for winter as well don't forget you know to take care of\nThe tools that you were were using all season again you should still be planting out there so you still have some time\nYou know when you when you bring in the shovels you bring in the rape she bringing everything take a look at it and see All right does anything need to be just tightened does anything need to be cleaned get rid of some of that dirt some of that access you know\nAnything that's on the the tools\nTo clean it off so it's ready for spring so when you go to do this you can just grab a shovel you can grab a raking go\nI'm One of the things he always talked about was putting WD forty on um anything that was metal like that to help from the rest you know that would be fine you could probably find some other alternatives some sort of oil or to put on there maybe more natural if you if you're looking to stay that way on there\nThe other thing that uh my father always talked about with me and talk about with others was right now have you don't want to do it but grab the snow blower started see if it starts because\nWhen we start getting snow maybe it's in February like it has been in the past we did get a one December storm last year in New England\nIf you go to go to start it and it doesn't start your your album that shovel and you're shoveling a driveway and if you have a long driveway that might take some time\nFor your call on a plow guy cetera\nBut definitely go out there take a look at your snow blowers started I make sure it works if it doesn't I'm sure at this time of year some of the uh small engine repair guys aren't as busy as they are when the first snow storm hits and everybody starts up their snow blower and it doesn't work\nI'm not saying everybody be you know what I'm saying take a look at those types of things also if you use\nIn a ... or ... anything that has gas and make sure you use\nThe things also if you use in a lower or anything that has gas and make sure you use all the gas on it don't let the gas ... over the winter especially if you're leaving it to shed a there could be some moisture that sits in their\nUm that type of thing that might get a\nCold that might have some water added to the to the gas so\nYou know use it run in store for for winter but\nIt's really about getting those things ready as well so next year you're ready to go you're not

welcome to the proper and garden club how can we help you\nWell I was calling to ask you um [noise]\nI bought highly Bush's uh about a month ago and there I got four of 'em and they're probably about four foot\nHigh and the containers that I bought that men and I know where I Want to eventually plant them but I don't want to plant them yet because we're having some renovations done to the house but my question is\nShould I keep them in these containers over winter in my basement in like a window or should we take them out of that containers and plant put them temporarily\nWhere our garden and you know usually is dig a man over there I'm I'm afraid they didn't freeze over ... says they haven't been established though if I put 'em outside and inside wondering what you think\nWell so I I definitely would want you to keep 'em outside a by bringing them inside they might acclimate to some of the temperature is a little bit differently they want to have a little bit of a dorm and see period they want to actually\nNot be growing they want they want the ground to technically freeze that type of thing\nBut that doesn't mean you have to plant them in the ground what you could do is you could take them in an area that's protected a little bit outside the side of a house where you know you're not doing the renovations a corner of the house so it's not going to get hit by the wind heavily\nDecent take the for plants and put them up against the buildings and surrounded with either salt marsh hay or some sort of um mulch around the pots and cover the costs of around all the way to the top of the ... if you if you could\nThat way in and bring it out a little bit don't just bring it right you know like an inch out bring it out like a foot so it's it's almost like it's in the ground\nOr because the thing I I go ahead\nSo you're saying I I said kind and leave them in the containers and take them in the ground or take them out of the containers and put 'em in the ground\nSo you could do either or if you want to leave him in the containers because you don't want to plant them in the ground and then dig them up in the spring and then move on you can you can do that by putting salt marsh hay or mouse around them or you\nCan take them out of the containers put them into that garden area get them into the ground so they can freeze with the rest of the soil and cover them with some you know most around the the base of it so really either way would work but I definitely want to see you have the plant outside versus inside\nOkay\nThe other thing you should do or for the winter is sprays of plants with will stop from bona fide that's an applicant that will keep the moisture into the plants since ... if you're going to leave them above ground ... and just have the ... or so much hair around them\nIt's really going to help 'em by keeping that moisture into the into the plant or even by putting them in the ground is going to make sure that during the winter and he has a snow or any of the wind is not going to drive the plant out as much\nSo sprayed that on there it's ripped the little make sure trips a little bit on there and keep it onto the plant\nSo it will help survived during the winter uh you're probably going to have to do it again in February if you can spray it\nAgain if there's so much snow or if there's it's just too cold ah you can't do it because when you don't want this to freeze to the plant that's why the temperatures need to be about forty to fifty degrees when you spray it\nOkay um so this is going to help it that way you also want to make sure you water until the ground freezes so continue to water until the grounds actually freezes so if you keep it above ground water until the ground is is frozen or if you put it in the ground the same thing\nOn the when it comes to say you want to leave him in the containers and leave 'em up against the house and protect them that way way to put the ... or the salt marsh hey until later on maybe closer to Thanksgiving especially if you're going to use the salt marsh hey uh the salt marsh hey is a perfect\nSetting for mice or small rodents so if you put it out now they're going to be built in their house and just going to take it and do that so you don't want to be putting that down now [noise] or you want to wait till Thanksgiving if you\nCould [noise] uh okay other than that it's up to you but I really would like to see him stay outside either in the ground or in a protected area with mulch or something like ... around the\nWorld Bank thank you so much for the phone

the seat or an underneath had been eaten so we had to get it fixed cost them a couple of hundred dollars\nOne of the things that he did going forward would use this product you would use mouse magic and use it religiously or like they say about forty five to sixty day intervals and he never had a problem after that he would always put it on the farm equipment or near the farm equipment that type

proper and garden club how can we help you\nPatrick good morning um we have um a few uh use their most of them are around ... one of them is they just Cornel shape and every year I'm In I'm June\nUm made me very early July you know like Trump back to the new growth you know like it's about an inch inch and a half a new growth [noise] and um this year um I didn't do it a kind of a\nHealth crisis from the family and everything went by the boards and um I I didn't trim that new growth and I was wondering\nI mean here we are at the end of October is it okay this is still OK to trim it will hard enough for the winter should just let it go and give them a like a good hair cut and like April or may and then\nYou know and then maybe again in June [noise] see I I guess from thinking is a couple of things you know I obviously I don't want to trim now if the stuff's stuck in a hard enough and if they're gonna dry over the winter we don't want to that type of issue and then the other thing is if it's like trim it\nAnd the spring I don't want to be trimming off any new growth that would come in in June or early same may and June because the new growth kind of helps to fill in all the little gaps you know what I mean\n... no definitely wondering what to do okay so you can actually prune at this time of year if you wanted to you don't have to uh based on what's happened you know\nYou're thinking about for next year one of the reasons why you prune in the ... or before you know usually it's before let's say July Fourth\nWhereas you know is you don't want to be pruning in the heat so that a plant will dry out so quickly from that ah that's one of the main reasons why you want to do it usually before July Fourth is like the cut off\nSo that it it's it's based on temperatures so you can do it now\nBut I wouldn't go that heavy shearing route would I Would try to do is take a look at it get rid of some of the\nYou know the dams on the side that or don't look so great you know it kind of scraggly that type of things clean it up a little bit and then you know shape it\nThe way you want so you said it's you know you have some that are a round some that are um cone shaped yeah so basically you're just doing a short pruning on it you're not doing a full year\nCone shaped yeah so basically you're just doing a short pruning on it you're not doing a full sheer you want to leave it so if\nYou're looking at it and say it's a six inches of what you want you want to print six inches off of it that your ideal pruning\nJust take a couple inches off now because you want to take leave about three to four inches of where you want it for at this time so next spring you're going to turn it down to those four inches down so it's like a stage process right now do a little bit and then in the spring go down to where you really want it to\nYou that way you know oh good I'm Sorry\nThat way if some of the tips do dry out there drying up just on the top and you're going to prune it again anyways a little bit lower\nSo that way you're still continue in that growth process and you cut it down a bit the one thing you can do to help reduce some of it right now is to spray the will stop on top of the plant after you cut it\nNo just spray it on there it's going to go into some of the the stems that have been cut and help 'em\nSeal that and keep the moisture in the plant instead of the sun and everything pulling the moisture out of the plant so that that could definitely you know be beneficial by doing that\nOkay I'm In for that uh the temperature has to be about fifty or something like that\nCould I mean it could be forties it's really okay to be doing at this time I you know you just uh\nI mean as long as you can get out there and do it and you feel comfortable it would be fine but the for the for the spray\nOr for to spray the will stop it has to be in the forties or fifties forty so okay and that's during the day I'm not talking at night 'cause overnight where you know we're starting to get those those freezes those those froth\nUm right right you know I Know there was even snow in New England or I think Thursday\nSo calories yeah yeah so in that if you flew\nF ... hopefully we don't see those flurries until you know after\nChristmas or right before Christmas [noise] right\nRight [noise] um okay Patrick I'm I as a music so I Know Andrew

I'm sure you all know of your local clubs running events I Know Florida some of the polish clubs have loews\nCorrect um you know he used to have four or five different places the bans would tour and that's been diminishing and we've seen to diminish in the crowd the club and so I had an idea and this is to throw out to our listeners as to\nWhy don't you would chat more frequently you know let's face it everybody can't go every week we all have lives we all have things that come into place you can't be there every week but you know the crowd to diminish so much\nAnd yet when there's a special event human new brass event that happened a few weeks ago right we saw people we haven't seen in a long time when the IP a has their event in March\nWe see people from this area that we haven't seen so my question to you and this is strictly my pool if you want to call it that because I have a vested interest in the music and the events because\nIf the ban stop performing if the Venus dry up then the recording stopped and so do the radio shows so we have a vested interest as well as all of you poke attendees so\nCompletely non biased because we're not affiliated with the band or the clubs other than we announced the Venus and we play the music of the bands why don't you go more frequently is it the time is it the ban is it the admission what's the reason [noise]\nOr maybe we can get some information and pass it along to the clubs and maybe\nWe can get a lot of the promoters to start working with each other because you know what a girl I hate the fact that there are so many politics in focus because it doesn't belong correct you go to have a good time to be with friends and enjoy the music and that's what it should be all about so maybe we can try to ah\nBring things back a little bit and we can do that with your help because folks if you don't go than the Venus dry up when I hear people not going to the dance is because they don't like the time change\nWell what happens in January or next year when they say well nobody came no more dance is that what you got to do so let's all work together that's correct I kept goal of this because\nThere is some talk on the weekends when there is just nothing going on in the weekend every one of us me included royalty oh gosh there's no clue how to go to\nBut but we got all realizes folk we control the Venus Venus that they're making money and having to good attendance they're going to shut down and\nWhat everybody has to realize is you know it'd be great to have more bands coming from out of the area but here's the problem it's very expensive for a band to travel so you get a ban like the diner brass that comes from Michigan\nYou know it costs a lot of money in fuel and time to get here and the guy's gotta get paid for doing their work and it if nobody goes to the dance well what do you think it's going to happen the next time some folks not be let's turn it over to you give us a call here we'd like to hear from you why don't you support the club's\nMore often correct give us a call at one three five eight six one for you know again that's for one two three five eight six something one but words hero

we'll tackle a lot of those email messages this in this week's show 'cause they had been pop pollen up a little bit we want to make sure that you get the answers that you need right now we're going to Nebraska with Ron\nHas a little shower issue Ron welcome to the show and what can we help you with\nA life ... a little more pressure than just a group out of my shower\nOh I'll tell ya you know um it seems like shower the let's say the shower experience as they'd like to say is getting less of an experience in some situations is is a a new shower old shower or has it been a problem all along\nThe way to do this film or a sixteen years ago the\nAh the village where we live and all these people they only allowed three quarter inch flying off the plane into the house which are ordered to go to an age but they wouldn't do that uh-huh so I have three quarter to the hot water heater but\nFrom the hot water heater to the laboratories and all it does copper uh-huh uh-huh have forty five percent or a\nSo they shouldn't be enough of pressure I just\nI've taken two pieces out of the shower and thinking that would help but it has a\nLot of times those slow restrict yours which you would never want to recommend that but certainly a lot of people will will um modify 'em the the the flow restrict yours but if it son if at sixteen years old um I Would think that there may be a little debris and there have you back\nI open that I'm going to down there wasn't oh there was a little black pieces of sediment and things like that but not much\nAnd I see okay um and uh so ... has the pressure steadily gotten lower\nI mean as as in you know actually it'll increase than decrease were\nWere subject to a water tower but what about five blocks from my house so we should have really good pressure and for some reason or other we just heard several neighbors say the same thing\nHa ha well you ... you know one of the things that uh we we had one of our listeners Rick I'm ... mentioned too is that they did to solve this problem which I thought it was a unique idea but\nStill a little risky is actually taking a tank they just had a water tank that they were able to purchase it was a thirty gallon tank\nAnd they actually position that in the attic next to their shower and so they did a little bit of rerouting and so that the tank would basically stay fooled because it was pressurized but when they called upon the shower for water they had that gravity push\nThat really provided now um they they taught the course it was all cold water\nSo they you know adult little balance same thing that you know read learning exactly where the ... needed to be in order to get that I'm cold and hot water makes a hundred yes right but I mean that's a little bit of an extreme I'm you know thing to do to do there but it whatever's restricting that may be very hard to find\n'em sometimes it can be the shower valve itself which is not an easy thing to\nAh replace ... have you ever try is it a single ... two years who handles okay\nIt's a single ever ... have you ever take have you ever taken that apart\nBut I have I have not to say that yeah it's one of those that you are a little the restrict or down into the tub so that goes from there to the shower right\nRight because you can take that um\nThat single of course you will have to turn the water off to the house since you probably don't have a you know cut off just for the shower but you take that um cover off you take the handle off to cover off\nAnd then you're going to find a little cube in there a little round whether it's a cube or whether it's a little round of control vow even there you normally it would have three different\nUm vow or three different little washers on it so many times you can have a little debris in there because what what it basically is doing is cold water hot water going into that little mixer and then it ...\nAnd if there's any debris and they are at all it's funny to talk about debris and water lines but it's it's in all of our water lines\nAnd yeah and a lot of times that's all it is maybe it's a little calcium deposit maybe is just a little bit of debris\nFrom something that's causing that slight restriction which you would think with forty pounds of pressure it's going to blow it right out of there are so many times it'll get rooted in there pretty well I Believe that's what I Would try on on on this one in and see Ron if you're able to to free that up a little bit you might you know you might find that deposits in there but\nHere's what you need to do close the during so that does the parts go down the drain as you're open it up don't hesitate to take a few pictures with your phone so that you can see exactly how it's coming apart\nAnd then just take it real slow in easy and see if that is in um where it is I'll bet you'll find I'll tell you another thing I found a lot or those washers being dislodged\nJust slightly to where it's cramping it and maybe cutting that water pressure down by fifty percent might be surprised and taking that out replacing those washers putting it back in and you might end up with the kind of water pressure uniqueness\nShow wondering if you are right because uh coming out of the space it into the to\nGo to the whole list of water yeah yeah when I go\nOut when you pick it up when you pick it up the other way then it's restricted also you know you want to make sure you take that showerhead off\nAnd turn the turn it on and just let it go for a while maybe even bumped the vow of a little bit and just let it really really slow I'm that way you know you you you might be dislodge him a little of that without having to do anything and then consider getting a new showerheads um you know because my wife\nWants to one of those green ... ... ...\n... yeah you're right and I know it's it's yeah is that those aren't as nice as as you think I see those in hotels quite a bit and it just a\nQuiet or again that shower experience but but some of the new technology with some of the of pulsating type of a shower heads and some of these other things are pretty interesting how much water they can get out of a shower and really it appears to increase it a good bit but but give that a try Ron I'm sure you'll find that you can definitely step it up a little bit\nBut I'm pretty sure that I hadn't even thought of that I uh I felt like it was all in the shower it but I Know it's not there after ... ...\nBut I'm pretty sure that I hadn't even thought of that I felt like it was all in the shower it but I Know it's not they're not part\nOf the I haven't checked the bell but\nThat it is bloody nightmare were getting clean water through the ... those are so good and I'm sure you know to solve the\nProblem already good good well I certainly hope so Ron and now we can help you any other way just let us know when I have a great weekend and thanks for listening should they use homeowner radio\nYou know those are the kinds of things that you face and you you know he's one of those things that every single day\nYou wish you could do something about it you know whether it's a um you know a toilet this leaking or it's something else that you see around the house so many times if you just stop and focus on it just a little bit\nAnd then let us help you find the right answer to whatever that challenge you might be facing you might be surprised at how easy it is to repair it yourself or at least have the knowledge to know who to call\nThis you're fire box and your gas fireplace there is completely separate than everything else everything else is like paint is just decorative so all of that can be removed\nTo wear all you're looking at on that wall is just the fire box and the wall which the fire box I'm sure is flush with the wall itself\nYeah yes it is exactly so so all of that could be removed okay now I'm\nSince ... Partridge a little bit there into the floors that a carpeted area\nYes it is and they're okay ... where the fire entered it might have\nA seat so so whatever you put back in its place would need to um to to replicate that\nSpace in order to to do that um you know in order to make sure you don't have to get new carpet\nBut then as basically just installing you can install that um any type of marble whether it's twelve ... twelve or whether it cheats right on the wall carry it all the way to the sea okay\nSo do you need to put any born before you put the tile right on the wall\nNot really but most of the board will extend it out many times we do recommend using a summit backer board or something along those lines but here you can attach it right to the wall go right to the ceiling and then you can use a low profile\nUm T. V. a male so that you can get that TV up just a little bit away from the\nFarm fireplace itself and then put any type of mental that you want in there at that time but what you might need to think about is before you put the material on the wall is to do any block team in the wall that's necessary to support the television as well as any mental ...\nDo you do before you do not pay exactly okay back in the mantle if there were like um I don't know ... or something sticking out to the mantle right or wrong with you that before yeah I see so I Would actually put the TV up before I Do this don't tell\nThat's right you know at least a brand new and everything so I Would start withdrawing certainly going online looking at the things we have today someone or dot com pinch wrist and all of the other inspirational type sites to get the the a closer look to what you have\nAnd then feel free to let me know and I'll be I'll be glad to guide you through the process and make sure that it ends

importance of having that proper air filter in changing it on a regular basis a lot of information Whitey known yet today's homeowner dot com\nAnd this little um it it um indoor air quality tip brought to you by her own new tone\nOr at right now let's see if we can get right to the phones Evelyn is in Washington state Evelyn welcome to the today's somewhat a radio show\nOh thank you for having a\nGood what's going on at your house there in Washington\nWell [laughter] I have a problem oh really oh wow it's a lot more than I ever notice any of my own and I've been in about five or six calls uh-huh it's accumulating in the um carpet\nOr in the bath tub which I've never seen and\nAll over the surface it's all over throughout the house now it's an unusual larger mouth\nWhile our our our listeners across the country are going to think we stack to these calls up here but I was just talking about ah this very thing well let me ask you about your house um is it up on piers got across space underneath\nWe do have a crowd space it houses are on a it's I'm On a hill it's actually carved into ill part of it and we do have a crowd space however if we can walk\nUp underneath it that way and yeah and I actually went under there today went in today\nOkay so so you have a fair amount of space there and I'm now do you have any plastic on the ground\nThere is some plastic however I notice that there is some areas where it uncovered\nOkay how does she know what happens so often I'm is when you have made it happens with very dry soil as well as wet soil in that\nThat water can migrate up into your home causing moisture mildew problems but along the same type of path you can have a very dusty conditions and what happens is your house a ... let me ask you in a more questions um you have central air and hate system\nAnd and what happens is your house or ... let me ask you in a more questions you have central air and hate system we do okay so so you have a return air system in your home that is pulling air into and through a filter\nAnd then it's being filtered hopefully whale\nAnd then going through your Duckworth system to distribute\nThe heat or the cool throughout the entire house so that creates a pressure that that that a suction that's pulling from all areas of your home matter of fact a lot of people are surprised to know that every cubic foot of air in your home\nPasses through that filter\nTwo to three times per hour\nThink about think about that so I Am a cubic foot all this space all this air you have is going through that one little bitty innocent filter two or three times an hour now but it's also because of the pressure if that duck or if like your return air\nIs not sealed completely under the house or in the attic or wherever then it's pulling whatever it can grab\nInto the duck or and spread it all throughout your house so that's one of the first line of defense is first of all make sure you have a good quality electric static filter\nCosts you twelve to Fifteen bucks sure you're changing that at least two to three or at least every two to three much an okay and and and and then really need to inspect that um have a air conditioning guy tell them what you're concerned about tell them that I mentioned that you might\nHave some dust this being pulled into the system and can they please make sure that it's sealed\nProperly because I'll bet that's what's causing the distribution of dust and and the ... of dust throughout the entire area that's usually what makes that happen\nOkay okay I can we do have it in fact it's a annually oh oh I Will ask him\nThat I mean I really do think that's probably the case there and then like I say that filter or will make a big difference in trying to cut it down but if there's a branch or a leak somewhere else and what they called the ...\nArea of the air conditioning system that so that filter won't help you at all but a check that out have them check it out thoroughly and I'll bet you'll be able to cut down on your dusting time\nOh okay All right [laughter] ... s shape your ...\nEvelyn thanks so much for being with us here today so I Wonder if we can help you any other way just let us know\nOkay thank you very much appreciate\nAlright are pleasure wow we're talking about um indoor air quality and then we have an email and we have a lot of color they're talking about the same thing uh October is indoor air quality month\nAnd you're ready to put a good quality porch and debt enamel on top of that\nNow I'm not sure what you've used in the past\nBut this combination I'm really worked really well the bonding proper will will really do create a really good surface for the porch and ... and I think you'll see that it'll hold it better than it ever has before that makes sense\nIt does do you have a preference between a latex or oil based\nWell I'll tell you I've always enjoyed used in the um oil base um on something like this but there there's a lot of um\nArgument or discussion in that the acrylic late Texas have more um let's say he left his city so when you have those cold mornings and hot afternoons because of the sun you got a lot of movement in the woods so I Will say the acrylic late taxes that are available\nIn the porch and decker ... right now are better than they've ever been before\nSo and it's a lot easier to use 'em and you don't have so much of a dry and time issue so I think either way he's really good I'm I don't know I I I've been using a lot of latex lately and and that's probably a a might be a good way for you to go a lot more to do it yourself friendly\nThank you so much I really appreciate your child\nOkay Lisa so are you a little frustrated there but I think I think this will help you a little bit I think thank you sound like okay thank\nYou as well appreciate your being part of the show I always think about that with a there's problem areas of your home and things that uh you know you just

mineral supplements but the cost of shipping may have stopped you well know more excuses because now\nOkay well here's what I Would recommend that you do besides using ear plugs when you go to sleep well here's the other thing I Would recommend that's important\nWhen you react to something like barking and it's not accessible locking your cases just short term barking\nWhen you react to that by grumbling are saying no or for whatever you do you're actually reinforcing that behavior so my recommendation is twofold to you number one especially in the evening before you go to sleep that's when they need a little politeness or aerobics class really exercise them a lot at that point what time is they are less feeding at night\nAre typically about six thirty\nOkay six thirty find you might want to feed them a little bit later you might want to break the six thirty feeding it to six thirty in a little bit more\nMaybe around seven thirty eight o'clock a full belly helps them sleep a little bit better as well but in terms of the barking at this point I Would not react to it I Would just cover your head at this point it will stop eventually but once you react to what you're actually reinforcing the behavior which is going to make the problem a lot worse\nI typically don't yell at them or or last August him at all\nThey don't don't don't do anything they don't even don't even make believe you're hearing them\nOkay and what you described earlier about their hearing ... all the laws\nAre so many others you guys are losing your hearing as well oh it happened yeah why not believe me it happens I'm getting a little over there myself it does happen on so in other words the possibilities that you're losing your hearing as well\nUm so maybe you're hearing it differently than you heard it when before you started losing hearing also but anyway the resolutions really easy would I Want you to do is just basically ignore the barking it will dissipate with time I promise but if you try to correct it at this point I Know no food or whatever\nIt's not going to it's not going to resolve the issues of give that a few weeks give it a shot and I mean are you making that\nUm do you think he would you ever get a tattoo of you to golden retrievers walk\nI Would learn it it's just a lifestyle but I Know people at all all of that\nThere you go if you don't go anywhere walk

... it was a soon after that soon after the war in Iraq had been going on for a few years so it must have been two thousand\nFive or two thousand six it was in the public comments part of the city council meeting and I don't know if you remember but back then if you said anything against the war in Iraq\nYou have all these people say you know you don't support the troops uh-huh it was a stupid stupid argument in fact nothing could be more supportive of troops than to say we want them to come back home and be safe and so\nAnd actually came to the meeting and she spoke up against against that and she taught she taught me a new word cannot just had this kind of hard but we don't support the troops because we are against the war that is not true and I made a mental note\nI got to look up the word I mean I knew more or less what she was saying but that's a strong\nWord and I haven't used in it you know I Want to use it I think there's any other worrying me right now you don't mind\nToo because you do words you do dictionary words was a good word\nA good word or a good way to use ... or a good way to disconnect I think that this whole segment is a kind of hard [laughter] just to set up for you have an opportunity to use the word ...\n[laughter] oh wow [laughter] okay [laughter] you seen the movie [laughter]\nI Want to talk a little bit overboard so if you go yeah I mean this morning I was reading in the in the local papers were ... that the government of words but he was suing the health insurance than to have insurance the insurance companies to the two and a five point five million dollars for not paying claims\nMany people including people in my family who had damage to their property ... and then many people who lost their entire houses and their rules they have not been reimbursed by the insurance companies that they faithfully had been paying premiums for many years\n\nTo the government is doing that I I just what I keep seeing is a lack of whether it's here in the United states whereas in Puerto Rico at the same thing the government is non responsive and I don't know if it's that they're just a bunch of incompetent people ...\nOr ... or cruel or it's a combination of both or something that I haven't even thought about what's so I Know you don't know much about what medical maybe you do do you not overly alright yeah but a ...\nThought about what's so I Know you don't know much about what you do do you not particularly alright yeah but I Am like maybe you've seen in the media here how\nWe don't have electricity again well no we don't because two islands that belong to Puerto Rico will ever MBA players are still andme relying on diesel power\nSo it's like my sister but my sense vineyard in a non talk it is to Massachusetts these two islands are so are you managing you know more than a year later if mental kit and Martha's Vineyard\nDo I think those are very wealthy island [laughter] right [laughter] you imagine if but still they still had to rely on diesel power they still didn't have\nAny other way to jam\nEnergize the health clinic the supermarkets the gas pumps anything\nSo I don't know what's coming online right now without knowing like I don't have\nExpertise in Puerto Rico's experience but last yesterday I was just said a pocket there is this your hosted by the resistance center at you know what's the resistance center I'm my understanding is that a center around the study of resistance and movements\nI don't understand like people power grasp is that what used to be the American friends service is something that's different\nDid says this is associated with ... so it's so it's\nPart like an academic oh It's Academic part of it later so they had a ... they have like a community talk\nJust respect ... [laughter] I'm just sort of was hearing the echo of my credit [laughter] sorry go ahead [laughter] ... [laughter] but\nSo you're I mean you asking that question like is the government and like you know are they back like what's going on why are they paying attention and so I went to talk yesterday with that um indigenous women and\nAbout like basically\nThe the laws that have been in place for years and years that are trying to destroy and replace indigenous\nPeople in the United states and I think\nThat in some ways that's true of every I mean into every non white human I'm across the board there's this like um I I you know I don't know if it's an intention sometimes it is sometimes it's not but it does seem like the policies that we enact as a country or\nAbout destroying\nOK talking to the microphone I'm Sorry yeah yeah this is my point to the microphone I was like yeah because then use your voice kind of drifts off a huh\nCool I'll just raise the volume yeah yeah you see given Bijan is ... do you think what do you think of the whole a dust up with Elizabeth Warren ... doing her DNA having a DNA\nTest so so that you could say look I Do have indigenous but my feeling is that she should not have done ... any more than Obama should not have shown his birth certificate it's like when people\nAre being stupid to you\nIs I don't validate the stupidity as like oh hey let me just like prove this to you know they're stupid they think the world is flat so what are you going to do and I come to them with no look at this low look at this you know\nYeah because the pictures that they took of the earth from the moon what do you think\nYeah it's kind of annoying that she did it 'cause I mean in some ways like people who don't want to believe her who just that they can use it they can still pick at it 'cause it's like you know this ... this far no you know relative and it was\nLike I don't I'm not I don't have strong opinions about it I guess but\nI think the only person who made a great case was Bill Maher when Bill Maher [laughter]\nIf the\nUs Donald Trump ... you need to prove that your father was not on a rank attack [laughter]\nAnd Donald awesome [laughter] if you can prove that I'll give you a million dollars\nBut Donald Trump showed him you know he publishes birth certificate as if he had to\nThis is clearly his father's not on a running a time was that Bill Maher said that his mother with human and his father was orangutan\n[laughter] um [laughter] I'm fine with it you know so it's like you're saying that Elizabeth Warren like doing the same thing\nWell no not as you're saying that maybe I Am saying [laughter] what's with all this like I got to prove to you who I Am when it's just ridiculous the the accusation to begin with is ridiculous the the the ... the criticism\nIs ridiculous to begin with so you know everybody's like oh I got I got to find my birth certificate so I can show you that\nYou know my father is not an ... in my DNA so I can tell you that my whoever it was way in the back which is you know neither here nor there for me mhm there was an indigenous\nRight and now she's going through this for this fire of some indigenous people saying well where where are you at Standing Rock right what are your people you know it's like I tell you the left is always criticizing the left\nIs just ... you can never win as a liberal in this country or maybe in any country mhm\nYou always fall short of something you always\nDisappoint a huge segment who's been criticized and I think that's what's happening yeah with others in this war and it's just like they're just jumping on her and how she asked me or should I Do this DNA thing and release has no absolutely not I don't even think about that in the end if anybody asks you\nKnow next question yeah I I just don't answer ridiculous and oceans you know we're in deep trouble in this country we need to concentrate on how do we let people out of poverty we need ... how do we get those children United with their parents again\nThey're really serious things going on here and whether you know this crazy man is calling me Pocahontas or not but doesn't fall into my top ten on my laptop and things to address\nThat she didn't ask me\nShe's not she should ask you so okay do you think the government's gonna get money from the insurance companies do you think they're going to be successful in their last oh no you know probably you know which insurance companies they're all of them yeah\nYeah all of them everybody who who have insurance and they're in their own part of the problem and I I'm not defending the insurance company ... part of the problem is happening was but he also you said some people don't have title to their homes because if we're not a very\nI was a social worker instead there was this time when a gorgeous actress gotta kid she
