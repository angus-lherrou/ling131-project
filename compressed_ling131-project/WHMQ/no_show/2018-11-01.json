with us for many years talking about the persecution of the week goes by the Chinese authorities the bullies who claim that the weaker is attacked them with knives so they gunned down five or ten or Fifteen people\nAnd execute the survivors immediately\nThat was that this is now what is the latest explanation for up to one million people detained against their will\nOr good evening John thank you for having me on your show again uh the the Chinese government has been\nA trying to come up as a a a Congress strategy\nTo a quote unquote try and explain to the world why do they have to have a a engage and twenty first century or not the style catching fishing camps so uh and the un are handled a call them out in August\nThe Chinese government has a big trying so hard in a different ways\nUh through their own publication at PRP again the materials to\nA one normalize quote unquote and then to legalize their um mass detention and criminalization of the week up people based on their ethnicity and religious practices\nNow let's look at the Chinese government's motive which the narrative is pretty clear ah their actions have been widely reported\nA so let's look at their a load of their number one motive for the Chinese government or in other words unstated goal is to achieve the China Dream\nIs belt and road initiative as I'm Robert Kaplan pointed out in his essay on the wall Street Journal the trick is that there is a big chunk of land\nThat can either make the Chinese allow the Chinese to get access to your Asia or block the Eurasia access\nSo the Chinese government wanted to completely et took control over not only the territory of the properties of the week with people but also the livelihoods of their livelihood including the other tricky people\nAnd then the to the Chinese government wanted to avoid\nA by you know their self fulfilling prophecy that they have created\nThat um they ... at the ... national identity eventually will be a potential threat for them so it it is truly a fantasy that they have a a a have been reactive through brutal policies and then the third\nChina's government has been very racist or this whole thing as a racist character the reason that uh we believe and and this has been said by many or a China scholars we're experts\nThat no government or in the twenty first century it was called somebody's ethnic ideology as the or as a a a cancerous tumor\nAnd no government around the world called Islam as a mental disease\nAnd also the Chinese government are having trouble to understand that their way of life to hunt Chinese people's way of life\nThat culture the language there called ah the truck Princeton life is not something universal and and they shouldn't be a imposed on people like Tibet things and the weakest\nSo oftentimes the Chinese government um ... tried to tell the world that this is all about security social stability but you don't walk up forty eight a well known academics\nSoccer player religious figures business leaders\nFlying through a pest musician ... claim that you're fighting against separate there's three evil forces it does it you know make no sense at all\nSo the Chinese government said this was about security but when you carefully examine their policies there'd be have years uh it it clearly suggests\nThat this is all about you think this is all about Communist Party this is all about China has struggled to dominate the world and this is all about imposing Chinese language Chinese culture by force if you don't accept\nWill take you out and in addition to what we have been covered some heartbreaking heart wrenching stories have been told recently is\nAnd in addition to what we have been covered\nSome heartbreaking heart wrenching stories had been told\nRecently a scholar based on the optical wrote it published and as long as the investigative report on foreign policy in China file that basically just that one million out one million and one million up near the Chinese government locked up\nA certain age grew up like a ... individuals born in Nineteen eighty and Ninety Ninety and intellectual and all other elite from the society\nAnd then they're falling do all those bedrooms those dining tables where Chinese cut right All right well they're coming into the legal like so that it it it is a dreadful situation that we're going to experience that we go home town\nWe ... a town or city like a ghost town be they were going to businesses I've been a have been bankrupt because the owners have locked up\nSo that it was clear it is time for action Gordon thank God that the United states government has been very outspoken ... because they're outspoken and they have some congressional leaders but your microbial Christopher ... already be in the process that interview thing at legislation\nI Wonder if I Want I Want to garden on one Gordon to enter here Gordon is is this story challenge used to challenge Xi Jinping routinely\nWell no unfortunately not inside China that's just not possible but outside China yes of course it is because this is a crime against humanity if something's got to be done about it the officials who are responsible for this need to be sanctioned and that includes ... himself\nSo when she just she just paying or his lieutenant show up at international bodies to talk about global warming or some other utopian version of their reality they they can be challenged by a the United states and its allies\nAbsolutely especially those who are in the chain of command in these camps all the way up to ...\n... is the former president of the week or American Association he speaks very carefully up the facts about persecution that is right now the major story for China the major story Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor\nMm [noise] ooh\n[noise] ooh\n[noise] do you teach him [noise]\nThere is a dynamic here that it's not being measured by these polls just like we saw I'm twenty six to eight\nMonths connect the numbers to know who pillows it meant to blow the\nInfamous now for having said the jobs the tax cut and jobs I just wanted to do was problems we have breaking news business to respond to Mrs below the this is Eric morass in the wall Street Journal\nOr within our American paychecks rose in the past year at the fastest rate in more than a decade showing a tight labor market is paying dividends for more workers'\nWages and salaries paid to private sector us workers rose three point one percent from a year earlier in the third quarter Labor Department said on Wednesday to\nThat was the strongest year over year again since the second quarter of two thousand and eight\nThe latest data add to this is a quote broader evidence that wage growth has continued trend gradually higher over recent corners\nMonica that's exactly what we've been waiting for to guarantee that\nThe Democrats were wrong to vote against the tax code and Mrs blows is wrong to say it's ... it's the fastest rise in a decade\nEverybody knows is Monica the puzzle is the paychecks are stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job\nDoes that get them the poll you think it does so why but these political scientists are telling us it's not as a non starter because the Democrats so villain I Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their book\nYeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are saying you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that is I agree a trumpet hates gods and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans that made the economic messaging more front and center going into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have slipped by and large\nThe more front and center going into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have by and large that national hold the Republicans haven't done that and it's it's been a source of great frustration for me but I also think that the American people a lot smarter\nThan that the press give them credit for they do see they're stronger paychecks they see the wage growth they did their job opportunities\nI think they see greater prosperity in every direction a stronger economy and international position for the country you know who's responsible for that the president and the Republicans and they're likely to reward that I really believe that that is true and it's first vilify Donald Trump\nI think we're in a whip around situation where they have done it so often and for so long that people have now tuned it out and they're likely to react in the opposite direction\nThe production by Nancy Pelosi said she will be the speaker of the house again she guarantee that on the Tonight Show I also stars they on the Tonight Show without laughing that what we need is a leader who doesn't divided to bring us together she said this without laughing however political science says there's merit to Mrs pillows these prediction\nThat the house swings to Nancy Pelosi if that happens Monica the worst case scenario is that the house is still made it they've promised investigations\nThat guaranteed investigation subpoena power in all directions do you believe those investigations will sway the American people to a turning against the man they voted in the end of the into office\nNo in fact I think it will have the exact opposite effect the way the Republican investigations into Bill Clinton and the Nineteen nineties had the opposite effect on\nPeople rally around the president even one is polarizing is this one he is still the president of the United states Bill Clinton same thing and the other thing that the two presidents have in common is a strong economy\nSo they're presiding they both are presiding over big strong economy whether it was in the Nineteen nineties or today and a strong economy a knock you'll aids presidents from a lot of nonsense a lot of investigations and a lot of ... because people are willing to overlook that when things are good for them and their families\nSo I think you know if we get a Democratic House yeah in my view this will be terrible we will have paralysis but I also think that Donald Trump is never as good as he is when he's got a foil\nNo better foil for Donald Trump that Nancy Pelosi a Democratic House which is overreaching every day with impeachment investigation\nAnd the rest so it's likely if that were to happen Trump runs against them for the next two years get reelected and flip to the house back\nThe Senate or the Senate is looking very favorable for the Republicans it's a good map out possible pickup of too but I Want to concentrate in New Jersey you're a Jersey Girl by\nA Robert Menendez is a deeply troubled candidate a we know about the investigations are we also know that\nThe uh papers in New Jersey have acknowledged that there was married to those investigations and are recommending in a blue state that people hold their nose and vote for him and I'm told this late in the game the national Democrats panic a little bit because they saw him and then does his numbers were weak and they poured three million dollars then\nTo elect him what is your sense Monica will will the liberals of New Jersey vote for a man who has such and such baggage\n[noise] you know I grew up in New Jersey John I loved the Garden State and my mother is still there almost every day she calls me screaming about Sen Menendez [laughter]\nI'd have for history shouldn't that he may God Forbid

Jim being [noise]\nGood evening I'm John ... this is the John ... to go to the mid term elections and China in the news always\nThe unhappiness between Beijing and Washington is obvious and is a driver for the economy of the United states and the economy of China we hear much about the economy of the U. S. and about the markets especially the stock market anxiety that test but what about China\nHow's it doing on the other side of the tariffs imposed and about to be imposed by the Trump Administration because of bad practices that would be\nGenerally understood to be piracy and I'm over capacity and subsidizing industries from the central government\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast is here as my colleague in cos guarding the Chinese side of the story\nHas lots of millions of people at risk here for a weakening economy in China because of the tariffs maybe tens of millions of people do they have a voice Gordon the way our\nManufacturing base has a voice at is a very loud voice these days and the Trump Administration did the Chinese manufacturers have a voice in Beijing\nWhat's a great question John and you know in the Chinese system um it is a complex series of bargaining among coalitions groups factions\nAnd political leaders so they do have a voice but it's very different from the voice that we have in our political system which is direct because as you pointed out we've got mid term elections we've got of course presidential elections\nThey don't really have that but it does mean Xi Jinping faces almost an election every day ... and that's a very different dynamic of course\nThe report from China and these last hours and in these last days is that the purchasing managers index which Gordon is taught me to pay much attention to\nIs at fifty point too which is lower than the expected fifty point six and a Reuters poll down from fifty point eight in September whatever means is weaker than it was so we welcome our colleague Andrew Collier\nHe is in Hong Kong and he watches the Chinese economy extremely carefully\nA Andrew a very good morning to you in Hong Kong these purchasing managers indexes are confused me and there's another headline saying the site chin ... China man if a purchasing manufacturers index\nIs in it better than expected at fifty fifty point one what is it pointing to what is the metric telling us good morning to enter\nA good evening John the metric is basically saying that the Chinese economy as a week\nWith lots of the people in the program I haven't played some of the people with many of the people we go to a baseball game every year it's clear to me the riverside is offering people and the reason to get up in the morning there was a social life soon in riverside industries people are given a chance to work up to their abilities\nPeople will share their paycheck swimming not the money but the amount that they earn in a way and there's some great pride surrounding all of that maybe sending side a little money and go to the baseball game any stigma than I might of attacks them has melted when\nPeople regardless it was pretty much like we're all very R.

I. dot org\nJohn bachelor show one on one by one o seven five fourteen hundred and twelve ... you know any any Jim being\nI've done that with Gordon Chang were very pleased to welcome Scott held full political scientist deputy director at the center for Asia Pacific policy at the RAND Corporation\nScott it's a pleasure to speak to you and Gordon guides me immediately we are eager for your thoughts about the meeting between the prime minister of Japan all day and the prime minister of India ...\nThey are two parts of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India\nJapan Australia and the United states all day and an Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what do they what do they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John Gordon and to your listeners around the world John I'm very happy Halloween to all of you um you know it's a good good point John the uh the Japanese and the Indians share both a common values\nAnd also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and India\nOr that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense of putting the region in a bit of a danger where it's possible Beijing may use coercion and unto on toward influenced to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he and Xi Jinping met late last week the very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where\nHe invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals and announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo in New Delhi Gordon\nScott you mentioned that a prime minister of a hosted a the Indian prime minister at his private home in at the base of mount Fuji\nUm what struck me about all this is that uh when I went to Beijing that it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meeting city had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with motives were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just a personal relationship but as you point out um\nJapan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with Modi and the significance of going forward\nYeah I think there's no doubt you know the\nThe Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country an Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced built its own version of democracy\nUh and and that shows through in the personal relations between\nUh the prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's not oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy as you've seen\nThey have been negotiating arms sales and other types of a defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest and trap perceptions immediate you read your results that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize that China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing you're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing searched Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing\nNot genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept that we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or\nHappy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents a kind of a sea change or a permanent solution to the problems that are sort of a difficult place where they were at the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a quad Indo Pacific region quad India Australia Japan in the United states is that aspirational or is that actual I think it's a great\nQuestion John you know I I Do think that this was aspirational about a dozen years ago at that time uh they're there for side there was not entirely\nA confluence of a belief that China posed a challenge or a threat\nToday I think that is much more strongly recognized and held as a view and all four capitals I Will say though that uh there continues to be a need to build a practical meat around the bones of the Quander lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to Japan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular rise high level contact including a two plus two dialogue but formerly been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet\nAnd the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing um artificial intelligence of robotics and working more closely or in the mail mail exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the quad has reached its full potential\nGordon Scott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels there\n[noise] Oh absolutely I mean I think that the reality with it is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have and not alive policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and the whites or any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limiting of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicated\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of are really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial type so I Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians\nTo find ways to work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside welcome pressure pressure that New Delhi can use to say look we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically in\nThe Japanese context as you know Gordon this used to be referred to run it still referred to as ... or use for foreign pressure\nThat kind of pressure can help India to make forward progress I'm kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures and the domestic economy and opening it up so that they can capture some of the real dynamism that exist in India is highly educated extremely skilled workforce that is unfortunately still in some cases\nAre trapped in the car to life industry structure that persist amount of caught up in some places\nIt's got Harold is full political scientist he's also deputy director of the center for Asia Pacific policy at the RAND Corporation\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast where speaking of the largest and most successful democracy on the planet India it must sixteen must or democracy\nDoes not have a bright future I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\n\nNobody H M me\n... most of these nations want us there um there are accepting of uh the Chinese investment and uh the investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there are with a little bit more of a of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other\nA smaller initiatives that or give them a sort of force multiplier in division example and Fiji um the Australian government help to find a fusion center there for the ... navy where they're able to see and have a sort of real time at a understanding of the ships that are coming in and out of their\nTheir fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones\nAre clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go\nTo the places where there might be trouble and that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill between Australia and history and government which are who are friends there and really also very present it in the region and uh with some of the island nations that don't have that kind of resources to\nTo invest in that type of capability\nThe Trump Administration speaks to the Indo Pacific region no longer just the Pacific and it also speaks of the quad\nUm organized to India and Japan Australia and the United states and India and Japan Australia and the United states did you see ... did you see the the the places where you visit\nLooking to hear from Japan and India and Australia how can they joined in this partnership to provide security and freedom\n[noise] um well I Would say that the un and my visits and almost every place I went I did meet someone from Australia uh either from Australia navy or Australian Government consulates a Japanese as well so there there is a presence there for certain um I don't think\nThe Indians have arrived as much on the scene yet but I'm not not to say that they're not I just did not encounter them when I was there\nAnd is that something the U.S navy or can work with in other words we've been we've been uh the dictator and send in the in the south China Sea or the two warships to the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese challenging it directly I understand the British Santa warship back to the Pacific the Australians have more ships there\nCan those warships or at least the personnel from those warships reassure Oceana that they're not to be left alone\n[noise] oh I think I think we definitely can I mean that is one thing that came up everywhere we went was they would like to have more ship is it's I'm not just for the sense of security\nBut also just to demonstrate our our uh our interest and those nations the the the cultural exchange that happens when our sailors come ashore [noise] uh the opportunity to get to know is better to sort of have I'd I interaction with the people I think of something that they really really value and frankly we we've not done as much of that\nBecause for a variety of variety of reasons we have high end warships that have high end missions and operational requirements for those missions has not subsided so we have to think about different ways there where we can establish that presidents were\nLooking at ways that we can possibly get our\nHospital ships out there again a to do more frequent visits that's another thing that they really really appreciate and helps build a lot of good well so I think we have to\nWe can't really I don't think we can really play a a whack a mole strategy here I think we have to become use our creativity and become a little more asymmetric and and uh advance our interests there using some of the values that we share with a lot of these nations\nI'm speaking with the under secretary of the United States Navy Thomas ... just back from Oceana but there is news here in the United states and we'll turn to that next report from the defense in ... about the defense industrial base just issued within these last this last month and\nThe vulnerabilities for all the military but especially for the navy going forward I'm John bachelor this is the John ... show\n\nYou all know that I traveled to the Republicans are by John this past summer in with my second trip in two years broadcast the riches\nOf the Caspian Sea bass and I've

Jim be [noise]\n\nI'm John ... so this is the John ... a welcome my colleague professor Lara Brown of George, Washington university political scientist and we're going to go to political science to look at one district that is a battleground district for the mid term in some days this is\nPennsylvania one otherwise known as Bucks County\nFrom Bristol to do a little town to Quaker town I grew up in the summertime in Bucks County it was in my youth in the middle of the twentieth century farm just being industrialized with great big highways moving through it\nBut still it had the feel very much of very far outside of New York now it's a commuting distance from New York Trenton is very easy\nAnd close by the train station new hope is also there so there's a lot of trend in it at the edges of a box county it's well to do I underline Laura a very good evening to the race here is for ... is for the professional and veteran Brian Fitzpatrick who's the incumbent Republican\nHe's challenged by Scott Wallace\nHowever you've sent me a link\nPolitical apple is like the takes us inside this not just about them but about how the district is polling on issues right now it's rated ... D for two polls icy and toss up for one poll how to read this as a political scientist what does this tell us about the rest of the nation as well good evening to\nGood evening John thanks for having me on tonight this is such an interesting district because the cook Political Report rate said as a toss up seat on the University of Virginia it's crystal ball rates as a toss up seat\nBy every measure that we know Brian Fitzpatrick is an incredibly I'm\nSort of well received and well liked income then Republican and in any other year I think most people would assume this district was going to fall\nHis way because he has been somebody who has tried\nTo really represent his district not necessarily his national party um but what is true in the numbers in this amazing political atlas a website that the\n... Center for politics and it says has created is it you can send snapshot fashion how he is being dragged down\nBy other factors kind of within his party\nOn the first one being that with in his suburban um district the Trump approval rating is twenty nine percent I'm so that is a good you know sort of twelve to Thirteen percent below the national average for president\nTrump and there's no doubt that sort of the the disapproval of Trump is dragging on Brian Fitzpatrick on reelect possibilities\nI'm looking at the main issues on social media this state wide not just the first district presidents\nReelect possibilities\nI'm looking at the main issues on social media this is statewide not just the first district President Trump dominate thirty three percent second of course has healthcare and Supreme Court\nHealthcare favors the Democrats if I understand in this election talking about Obamacare has suddenly turned into a positive because the Republicans fumbled it in the first year of the president's term\nSupreme Court that looks like a mixed bag because of the Kavanaugh\nA scandal and how it ended so I can see that they're pulling push but to remind the rest of the nation did not grow up in Pennsylvania this is a county Bucks County that entirely reads the New York times every day okay if it's in Pennsylvania it might as well be a man that\nThey're very well informed quite sophisticated heavy media all the time uh and they they process themselves and part of the Bosnia wash court or so it makes sense that they're sensitive to Trump\nNo the Democratic candidate here Scott Wallace he then has very little to do other than to emphasize the trumps in every headline is that the campaign lower\n[noise] well I think so certainly I Would imagine that he is trying to create distance from ...\nBrian Fitzpatrick on the issues around health care or say around 'em guns but again\nI mean one of the things that is true is that it's Patrick has been incredibly moderate very reasonable he's actually I'm sort of one of the members of Congress who's engaged in um essentially what's called the problem solvers caucus so\nHe is somebody who is kind of modeled this notion of we should be civil work across the aisle find\nPlaces where we can connect and I think what's so interesting about\nThis contest is how this contest goes on election night will tell us a great deal about how a lot of the other suburban districts in the country will go and so this is certainly one to watch and it's one\nIn the east you know a poll closing time in Pennsylvania I Believe is eight o'clock I'm Virginia will close at seven\nUm but we will have a sense of really where this is going when we look at a seat like this on election night and we look at a seat like I'm Barbara Comstock in Virginia\nThis is Pennsylvania where the Supreme Court re district between the last election in this election of this district ... in a slightly different configuration was plus nine for ... only eight plus two for Brock Obama and twelve and plus two for Hillary Clinton\nIn sixteen so would with a Republican as representative so it's a perfect target for the Democrats if they're to move the needle back to their side of the majority Laura let's go to the larger map\nThe conventional wisdom last week when we talk was that the Democrats take the house somewhere between twenty three and forty feet a pickup which would give the majority\nAnd the Republicans hold the Senate possibly a to pick up has anything moved in the last week\nUm I don't think\nSo I mean there is this question about whether or not\nThe Texas race between Beto O'Rourke and an incumbent Senator Ted Cruz is essentially narrowing and becoming more competitive there was a poll out today that suggested that the distance between them was more like three percentage points and not a six percentage points\nI think that's going to be um very much a function of turnout and then there's also this question of how much immigration versus health care really plays in sort of the important states the states like North Dakota where\nThe incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is trying to um\nSecure reelection where Joe Manchin of West Virginia is trying to secure his reelection um those are the states where really this question of will the president's um desire to focus on the caravan and illegal immigration\nAnd asylum seekers or will um the Democrats desire to focus\nOn the need to protect pre existing conditions and support\nThe Affordable CARE Act that's what will matter\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's also professor of George, Washington university and we're looking at a website political hyphen atlas dot com with a great deal of detail I mean it's just granular to the nth degree so if you're a geek like me you can stare at the election night\nThe district we've been talking about his first Pennsylvania Scott Wallace was raised and norm is amount of money compared to use incumbents these race Thirteen million dollars he has two million on hand as opposed to Brian Fitzpatrick who's raised only three million dollars in comparison that used to be a lot of money in the first district\nAnd he only as less than half a million dollars on the hand on hand so that this is an example of how the Democrats have overwhelmed the Republicans will fund raising in this cycle\nI'm ... this is the John ...

subtle it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody\nThe president's council of economic advisors Richard has that linked to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic socialism does not make\nCommon sense period however it's important to pull it apart on the basis of what it believes is in his historical precedent\nThat would be the nineteenth century and the language of Carl Marx as inherited by the man who you know we call Lenin or the definitions Richard applies in his defining ideas besides never looked at them as closely as I did and Richard definition because they don't make any sense on the one hand we have\nA definition of socialism that includes these words regulated by the committee as a whole what the heck is that I asked myself the other definition we have is\nCollective ownership of the means of production what the heck is that I asked myself and then the updated version this is for the twenty first century by those who call themselves democratic socialism Megan Megan days\nRichard citation pooling societies resources\nTo meet people's basic needs what the heck does that mean\nI think Richard the language here is so inexact dumbfounded because it doesn't have history and when we offer examples you just did with Venezuela we can talk about you but we can certainly talking about what happened in Russia when we offer historical examples\nIn which they shuffle aside and say now now that was failure we're going to do it right Richard I do not believe that we can we can debate with people who don't do history\nWell I certainly won't be able to do it right but let's just go back to the analytics of the points any serious activity\nRequires joined cooperation either through exchange or to corporate businesses are corporations but when you start talking about the collective ownership of a from\nThese are so but then the five people who pick their friends put together and then when they do is they put together goods to sell to the world or share that they could sell the other people and everybody knows the business that they're buying from or the business that they're\nBuying into so the collective ownership is a way of combining labor and improving productivity when you say the collective means of production are owned by the government that when it went and sorting process no longer takes place and so which of the three hundred and twenty five million people in the United states are going to be at the\nHelm of which benches and why is going to be determined solely by a political process all political process these are these terms turn out to be completely unstable because what happens if somebody gets in gets elected and appointed friends in\nCronies to take these jobs over there is nobody who can discipline them by saying I'm not going to invest in your particular business\nBecause I don't think you have a decent business plan so they do is aches procreate tax money and then they put it to benches and they have no idea what to make her how to make it or why to make it so the system essentially um this fused responsibility\nLeads to nobody controlling anything which is not going to last very long or to these arbitrary groups coming in and Tennessee taking over segments of the economy without the consent of the people who invest and so if you ask a simple question and I can this collective pooled asset\nPlan and work with government control the answer is no now does government have a role in regulating the economy yes one of the things that you never hear\nTalked about amongst socialist is how is that regulation\nActually does make sense and I'm thinking here of common carrier regulation like public utilities and railroads where you knew know what you're trying to do which is to control the use of monopoly power as it would otherwise exist\nBy putting in a set of rates that leave enough money to the firms so it doesn't go broke but prevents those excesses this is a very hard road to follow but at least you know what the messages when they're talking about government regulation\nThey're not trying to talk about reaching some kind of competitive ideal they have no respect for Marcus no respect for competition no respect for the fundamentals theory of economics which is that the repetitive solutions cannot be\nTopped by any arbitrary solutions you put into place so the only question is when you can't have competitive markets a good capitalism is willing to think about limited regulations to create it but when you can have competitive markets the last thing you want to do is to have the socialist come along and read them by taking over all the means of production\nI'm speaking with Richard Epstein at the Hoover Institution and he's a senior fellow he also teaches law at NYU and the University of Chicago we're dealing with the Democratic
