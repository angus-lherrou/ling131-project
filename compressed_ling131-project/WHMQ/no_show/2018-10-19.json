I wasn't sure what they were being handed but it certainly was a clear that they were eager to get whatever they were handing out\nRight so this this you know that this will be used by some pac superPAC as we get that they count down from what is it the ... we have left so again this is you are absolutely correct a national security issue and it should be couch this sucks let's not\nForget also the speech\nThat the other presidential candidate gave\nTo a group of bankers that was leaked to the press and anybody to listen to your show John can download the transcript which Hillary Clinton\nTold the audience my dream my objective is to have a water in this hemisphere meaning from Canada to South America no national borders at that point you know as well as anybody else America as a concept\nYou know national borders a court you know as well as anybody else America as a concept ceases to this uh this is talk the whole issue of the world for years by the ... and the president\nIs a nice detail from the wall to Wall Street journal some vulnerable Democrats are using the issue as well Senator Joe Donnelly who is running for reelection in Indiana has run advertisements promoting his support for Mr Trump on immigration\nIncluding building a border wall while taking a shot at quote radical left over calls to abolish ice so\nIf a vulnerable Democrat in Indiana is worried about the as I can imagine the vulnerable Democrats in other red states are worried about this ... this is the Senate but that would also\nMean that vulnerable at a Republicans in suburban districts that Democrats have targeted would cut can use this issue to bolster themselves\nI think it's incredibly effective irrespective of geography or who's running I I used when I was in the White House is very simple of allergy when a when you go to bed at like do you look you ...\nIf you do is it because you hate everybody outside\nIt's because you wish to protect every single love inside your uh America as a whole\nAnd its border is Trump's door of the idea that we were lost control who and says oh there's a cost of these ethical ... so most Americans are also is a very simple\n... matter of or the metro fact that the individual who has that you make rights to decide on\nWho comes into this country by which y'all stick a measure is the incumbent president that this is not a hot argument to make for any politics should in any district of United States\nSebastian Gorka the national security strategist for Fox News he's the author of the new book just issue why we fight I'm John bachelor they says the John ... Russia\n\n\nOr [noise] ooh\nThat one page Pam\nUnpredictable president that might in fact jeopardize that relationship so I think they're going to be a little bit I mean they want them to come across the causes discomfort or the Wayne what's in their self interest\nThe report here from the Associated Press Mexico's federal police commissioner said the officers\nDispatched will support immigration agents Mexico said migrants will have to show a passport and visa or apply for refugee status otherwise they will face deportation that as an update of what we saw during the Obama administration and the first year of the Trump Administration now the larger store and Victor with age to go to the to the mid term\nImmigration is one of the stories that that can be told on the well known cables I keep repeating the political science mantra that we vote on pocket book is that still the case or people's passions persuading them that there there are these other issues to key on\nNow I think if it's complex but I think it's still you know four percent economic growth in record near record on them a little warm climate but the only danger and that is that when people are doing very well they have the leisure the complacency\nThat to to look at hot button social cultural issue and that's what the Democrats are counting on that this can be a referendum on the cruelty of Donald Trump but I think you're seeing with Mexico that\nFor all of Obama's um ma liberal of appeasement and international is when people didn't have any respect for them and people are starting to sense that\nObama would have never gotten Mexico to even do anything on on its own border but whatever they think of Trump\nBut for them and people are starting to sense that Obama would have never gotten Mexico to even do anything on its own border but whatever they think of Trump people abroad tend to listen to him more than Obama met starting to get clear in these last two years and I think that helps Trump that he's considered\nA strong leader and people when when there is no alternative Jong when you see these people coming forward and they're saying I'm going to be in the United states and six or seven days and you can't stop me and if we can't stop and then we don't have a country anymore so most people are saying to themselves well I don't like to separate families but if they're coming\nAnd they're so or ... days just to say that we don't have the guts of the world power the spiritual confidence stop them\nMore than a ... if they are right that we don't have a country anymore\nAnd so that makes it pretty stark choice this mid term has basically between the rule of law\nAnd the maintenance scratching doors with the Supreme Court or people crashing the border it's law versus ...\nAnd I'm here to for that's always favored the party in power the question here is are the polls are telling us that the house\nIs not it's not an overwhelming success for the Democrats but it is except for the Democrats and it all the polls are also telling us that the Republicans will enjoy the majority in the Senate and will increase the majority in the Senate is that enough to hold the Senate for the presidential election and twenty Twenty one Trump condoned action it's\nHard to know but I I'm not convinced shut the if they're going to lose the house I Know that historically the in party loses seats\nBut that that the law for the seat is often the Jew decay them whether that's going to lose the entire house when you actually asked the question rephrase it does the ... party lose control of the house rather than just lose a lot of seats\n'em and changed the the the political nature of the house the Mets not as common it's only three or four times\nSo I think they can lose twenty seats and that would be historically in line with what usually happens but not necessarily lose the house because things are changing and usually when you see an abrupt change\nIt doesn't rode it gets more intensive and I think the ... and all and the aftermath of the Kavanaugh and ... was with the war on and the caravan they all have a force multiplying effect of saying\nThis is not the Democratic party your representative whether you like him or not is now a you know in service to the\nThis new Neal socialist progressive movement and he won't have a choice and you better understand if you vote for a Democrat evil and keeps the president they control the house they will investigate Republican House members they'll call off these investigations and that just the way it is and I think a lot of people either not vote\nThat are democratic or just just\nThat they're not necessarily going to vote for that\nThe ... the polls do show that in the sixties six I Believe it's sixty six battleground districts where the Republican representative ... is in a district one by Mrs Clinton and the twenty sixteen and those sixty six districts the generic is nowhere near as a separated as it is generally in the country\nI agree with that and and I think that again these trends are starting to attempt I live on a conjunction of three districts\nAnd they're all to Republican one Democrat

Devin Nunes is going to get reelected even though he's being outspent by two to one Jan suspending twelve million dollars and he's still going to get reelected easily and then David ... an a plus eleven\nDemocratic district he's the Republican he's going to get reelected\nAnd then seven term Democrat Jim Costa ... has a really strong challenger and Elizabeth hang a Southeast Asian child of refugees student body president Stanford Gail MBA a very charismatic and she came within three points of beating them in the in the primary and that just doesn't\nIt's not typical of a huge blue blue wave at least where I Am\nVictor Davis Hanson of the Hoover Institution commenting right away on the news and the news continues from Guatemala selling in Guatemala City now where the headlines say the Mexican authorities are prepared to turn back\nThe caravan if they do not have a passport or a visa or apply for refugee status when they reach the Mexican border President Trump congratulating Mexico thank you Mexico we look forward to working with you you know he doesn't need a pressing and he says I'll presage and they should have a sense and I'm John bat so this is the John ...

the bad actors the sinister nature of the bad actors is that they hide in front of large nation states in this case we're looking at it has a law and Brazil Malcolm us to question it's yours\n[noise] yes first of all the good to talk to chose to begin a what do you think about the arrest of a sudden Barakat who is a key ... or ... financier and what do you think the likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states\nWell that that's actually the second question is actually really really an important one let me get to that but I Try to my barricade that's a key get at the key get for um any any government really in the region and I'll see if we can actually the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the ... in in South America it's an old Lebanese clan that type to Hezbollah that's in finance in not just listed narcotics and things like that but the bulk of finding the terrorist operation including the army attack\nIn Nineteen Ninety four which is white and I think government should talk to her first um so yeah what are the chance that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nThat a U.S person that we'd have to charge him with something you hear in the United states them with money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge him with but I think that you're not going to be anything like that happened after the election in Brazil\nOr because I think we're going to see how the political makeup is in Brazil and then the if there's a time the opportunity to do to do so uh so I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think this is a great kind of a a symptom of the success that we've been having a more recently because I think you know the Trump Administration\nDrop in Michigan to complete it it'd be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America would they've they they've looked at Hezbollah very strongly in and try to work with the regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in which a man who's described as a far right populist\nWho managed to I was stabbed in the ... the stomach during a rally is now leading all contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly and Portuguese so I'll say both so narrow you know he is he is he going to be a help\nA disrupting the protection of bad actors or a hindrance because he's a ...\nYou know I think it's going to be a tremendous help he comes from that an establishment wing that's been a wave throughout the world that you know obviously you kind of a similar\nA scene in the United states would be elected President Trump he ... he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background yeah he was at ...\nIt could be elected President Trump he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nYeah he was that X factor not nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of the of the election season but now he became the front runner and he and he looked like he may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls it it'll be a close election and the first round which was more candidates now it's just and\nAnd a guy named Daniel had that and and so I I Do expect them to win I think he went and if he does he's very close to two religious communities including the image eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military and he goes to other elements I think they have direction only correct\nWho's the bad actors in South America particularly Brazil and I I I think he will be a tremendous ally if he gets elected Malcolm\nA designated this week the ... as a top transnational criminal organizations giving more resources to targeting the ... and the drug tracking ... activities racketeering et cetera and what was little notice is that this apartment of justice created a subcommittee\nOn Lebanese Hezbollah and now has Ninety Days to get specific recommendations how to disrupt and dismantled because well I was transnational organized network so what do you believe are the most pressing items that they can do how do they prioritizes and how will the administration back this\nSo I'm Glad you mentioned that now that this is a a you know with all the things are happening in the world and and here in the U.S as well this is ready to use that and that really didn't get a lot of attention but very quietly dispatches announce something that the major move for those are in the counterterrorism community\nHe put one of the biggest terrorist groups in the world has bullet Lebanese Hezbollah he put it in the category of a transnational criminal organizations\nAnd he bought it among the most important transnational criminal database that this country's facing because they're tied right next to the three biggest cartels in Mexico\nSet the lower\nThe uh looking at a cartel\nSo he basically just in fact we just made it has with transactional commercialization now what does that do in Latin America that gives Latin America much more authority much more priorities to put has blend a different category 'cause they still struggling Latin America understand terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism\nBut they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with every day because it's allowed 'cause let's get a more of a priority among a regional government and what do I think they should do I think a subcommittee that has been formed within the department of justice led by a better in ... Illinois rap\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exist that are already on the docket\nOf Hezbollah members whether involved in America trafficking money laundering counterfeiting or even some terrible way to get like the one I'm involved with in Peru above Mohammed ... dark and put all the way to department adjusted to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction because they can get a quick when there's a lot of these are already on the docket\nIn in different courts Latin American power away in Peru and ah in Panama and Colombia and and so I think this is where the priority needs to be a right now\nI Know John Venezuela 'cause we just have a minute Joseph ... increasingly under the boot of the Cuban security services does that enhanced Iran's presidents to Cuba is the is the strength of the of the dictatorship does I Do have an in Tehran work together\nYet ... it's called the alliance you know just like the United states has the bye-bye England and New Zealand Australia and Canada they uh they have their own by by which is you know Iran Russia Syria China North Korea and they communicate a quite a bit including with Cuba human intelligence is very much involved in that and that intelligence alliance\nBut ah yeah they're very much so like you're talking about Venezuela to one of the there's an important case headed back to his bill as well in Colombia\nThere's a gentleman named Alex ... who is a front man for a president Nicolas Maduro who the Lebanese Colombian\nWho works with Hezbollah to launder all kinds of cocaine to move multi shipment of cocaine and longer all this money and he just went missing recently at the big in Colombia that in a in the press down there and that that's connected to Venezuelans human intelligence that they know what that we've been talking about your show John for several years Justin\n... is the executive director of secure freedoms society Malcolm home line conference presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John ... [noise]\nDo any age him be\nAnd one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how prisoners OCC was United States recently met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nIn some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation [noise] yeah\nIt's interesting I mean it it comes around the same time as the annual Egyptian celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but um she she is vulnerable politically he hasn't consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for public consumption but behind the scenes\nOr it strikes me that uh the security cooperation will continue or if it's only because Egypt since really need it they've proven themselves to be manifestly incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Sinai Peninsula and it needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nAh the thing is he still I'm taking phone calls from Moscow [noise]\nBoy I think without a doubt that the Egyptians are interested in developing their relations\nWith ... and that intention to use the port for the Russians ... is that going for\nA ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing or basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of wistful romanticize Asian of the Soviet period in Egypt\nAnd there is a natural place for the Egyptians to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible from these great powers so [laughter] um I there is a there's a genuine interest in developing the relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states\nWe've seen that the problem that many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east today face our economic problems you cited it it'd be force even Saudi Arabia\nAnd imprison people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of Turkish citizens have sought residency in the United states\nJust in twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and many more in UK and elsewhere\nHow does or to one seat and what is the basis for the new turkey for the economic basis when he's losing and dismissing the academics from the universities and many of the others are are leaving\nUndoubtedly there was a brain drain out of turkey\nThis ongoing purge that has affected the lives of almost a million people when you think about um you know family members ed included with those who have been\nOr detained or a jail pending trial we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat it says done has sent a chilling effect through the business community which has now um moved assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community to the extent\nThat they will told his line but protect their assets all the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism\nThat you had in the Turkish economy in the mid to thousands for example under a ... a under circumstances where everyone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy in ... and the kind of repression\nThat continues but the business community says that though will continue to soldier on but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nIn the province it has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia matter there is a report that the Russians and the Turks are patrolling the border and does this Todd go along with the idea that it will be a just a permanent stain on his country or is he pushing for more action\n[noise] ah it's complicated but it seems that for now that agreement is going to hold but it really is going to delay\nA in operation in ... in it live rather than permanently put it off by the Russian military in particular\nA feels very strongly about cleaning up a ... pocket they called it a a festering sore a of terrorists to an extreme is\nSo um they're also report Saturday Night live bit despite the kind of joint uh operations between turkey and Russia um that ah various extremist groups that which by the end of the month have to give up their weapons are refusing to do so [noise]\nUh and that would trigger response from the Russians and the Syrian Government and the Russians have been supportive of the Syrian government's desire to reestablish Damascus has control over\nA over the country so I I think um it live is not in the headlines but I think it's going to come back into the headlines sooner rather than later\nMalcolm or could could could you ... what is the impact of what happened with Saudi Arabia are and the other countries in the region that particularly running and turkey are in in the war in Yemen we'll just have a direct impact will will ah ah Saudi Arabia be reluctant to continue the bombing and the expense of aid\nUh I don't think so I I think as long as king Solomon wants to have a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown prince uh this is going to be the policy of the government of Saudi Arabia I think certainly um\n... Mohammed bin Salman ... opponents within Saudi Arabia are emboldened by this but you know\nWho were who how are they going to seek redress or he controls all of the\nThe important levers of power in Saudi Arabia so they can be angry about what's happened they can be angry about him and they can be angry about what's happening is stumble to Jamal ... but it it in the end they have no power to that\nAnd what's happened they can be angry about him and they can be angry about what's happening in Istanbul to Jamal ... but it it in the end they have no power to fact a a real change that will ultimately alter policies in places like Yemen and other places\nA final question it hadn't occurred to me that till now but a steep cuts hair does the the have a say in any fashion at risk in any fashion about the subject matter is that is that a problem for Cairo are they on the outside\nI think for the most part I'm there on the outside the Egyptians have expressed support for the Saudi Arabian government um and of course uh the Egyptians and the Turks are true tremendous the odds are over ... support for the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo uh it doesn't really affect the Egyptians directly but they can be counted upon to support the Saudis innocence that\nSteve Cook the any Enrico ... senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations Malcolm a whole lot conference of presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John bachelor [noise]\nThe retail landscape is rapidly change and for leading brands cutting through the media noises Quito attracting consumers and turning them into custody studies show that Seventy percent of the human brain is used for [noise] site [noise] mark digital times elevates away brands engage consumers drive sales and impact brand value\nInfluential consumer experiences need to be powered by and impactful digital communication strategy\nDriving consumer attention and action\nGala a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience tune into the job that show every Friday or listen by the John ...\nFor the scholar report and in depth segment about how emerging technologies laced into all areas of the economy but business to business and retain\nThis corporate profile but it is run by Amarillo gold\nAccompany building by next profitable gold mining mineral rich Brazil Amarillo gold is rapidly advancing as price Maduro's a development project was over one point one million ounces of gold reserve\nGrading at one point for two grams per ton with a relatively low cap Exeter production goal year end twenty Twenty one do you turn right of return is estimated to be a remarkable fifty one percent per animal\nWould annual production exceeding one hundred twenty three thousand gold ounces with the potential to increase the reserve resource down dip and along Trent uh ten thousand meter drilling program is currently underway\nWinner I Hope we Shrink Rap and you can store your vote inside or outside this way and now is assigned to reserve your doctor space for next year's faces\nAlways limited so called ... marina now make ... your memory servicing dealing Knoxville marina exit Eighteen on nine Ninety One north Hampton ... ... ...\n... ... he won\nA local example Donald Trump's do you mean immigration policies to separate children's and their parents ... has now been sanctuary in the first church in cameras for one year old and we'll be speaking was ...\nAt nine o'clock build new meant W.

running missions into the Gaza Strip missions into the west bank no longer now that is the site of well how does it work Malcolm is that the American embassy or does that serve as the embassy in Jerusalem how does it work\nOkay uh well the location as you rightly describe is this sort of high walled enclave right in the center of Jerusalem western Jerusalem uh right near the hotels up the

report to the ambassador in the country to the embassy\nThey usually subservient to the embassies but this one reporter directly to Washington because they didn't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's

president is with me and we push a button and we go to Israel\nVery silver charge us a journalist and an analyst on Middle East politics he's an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute an area of course because there's an election pending here I have to ask immediately with the Israeli governance is there an early election possible is that an advantage to Netanyahu good morning to\nA morning good to be with you again I'm that's right I the mood here is a very much one now heading direction of early elections a Russian rescheduled anyway for next November November twenty Nineteen uh but the consensus is that uh that can Yahoo like we uh\nPull the trigger I'm On early elections a for a variety of reasons but at this point it's looking like possibly ah early spring or possibly march or April [noise] um and you know protecting Yahoo is politically or beneficial or you've got to pass\nA to kind of create the narrative that he was going to let you go to being dragged into an election uh but I think more importantly I'm is legal issues I think\nHe wants going into an election as opposed to being dragged into an election uh but I think more importantly I'm his legal issues I think we'll dictates a both the purpose and the timing\nOr he wants to preempt I Believe a trade general's decision\nOn his various corruption investigations and if he goes to the election beforehand and are most likely win that election beforehand\nA than he can kind of a put that at the door they try to get on and what the people know that all of this is going on at they still are returned to mandate to me um you know go ahead and\nTry to issue an indictment\nAs the warden gossip the impact that an and more importantly how does Israel's response knowing that the people in the south are very dissatisfied with the continuing ... attacks and\nEspecially now the rocket on on a bed share that which I described as a crossing a critical red line for the people and for a ... the government and despite the fact that the opposition\nDoesn't appear to be able yet to come together to present a credible alternative what what does the Yahoo choose to do in view of the election in God's\n[noise] so that's a great question I think the one complicating factor for Netanyahu right now I'm you're right is a possible Gaza escalation if not a war ah so I don't know if he'll necessarily want to let's say pull the trigger on early election can dissolves the or the government is\nIf the countries in the middle of a campaign um you know you don't quite know or you can get into a war but you don't quite know how are you going to get out of a war um and the truth to that over the past week Gaza has really come to the forefront and and could erupt I Would argue or today friday or here in Israel\nUm but but at the same time or the ocean and a lot of restrict\nOr both he and and as a security cap and have children out of her strength\nOr as you mentioned uh the rocket on ... and also one fell off the coast of Tel Aviv\nTwo days ago or the response there wasn't the IDF response but it was a relatively measured a there waiting and seeing how amongst response today to uh to planned a you know friday Gaza border marches and that'll dictate really how how Israel moves forward\nOr the government said that the rules of the game have have changed that they're going to respond a lot more forcefully to any any violence coming out of Gaza with rockets or\nOr border violence um so we have to wait and see whether Hamas actually a push is both a he and and Israel and escalation\nThe north Syria is that a no longer a priority risk because of the negotiations between Netanyahu and poked and\n[noise] no I wouldn't go that far uh it's always there uh Israel is monitoring what Iran and its proxies are are still doing in Syria\nBut but you're right in the sense that it's kind of falling off since the big altercation on the air between a between Israel and and the Russians a number of weeks ago\nA and as not mentioned earlier the uh the as three hundred are being deployed to Syria that also complicating factor or no Israel has has said and I believe it to be true that though\nThe act when they need to act or in Syria to stop Iran from from I'm basing itself there militarily but\nBut it's been fairly quiet over the past few weeks um and that's one on the ground though it's interesting that the border crossing between Israel and Syria or in the Golan Heights is actually a reopened a few days ago that's\nAlso a a signal stability or the question though is how long it it can hold 'em and but it's always the priorities are Israeli Martin's arguably more than about Malcolm\nWe see that the Jason Greenblatt and others are talking about new initiatives or one I think that would ... economical United guys and the west bank they the massive talked about the economic incentives ... where is the plan now have you heard anything about\nAny possibility in timeline given the fact of what's happening in Gaza and obviously doesn't appear to be a an opportune moment to start talking about reconciliation\n[noise] ah right I mean the Americans um you know led by green glass jar Christian or the best er here Mr Friedman are are involved with a you know there are few moving parts so number one they're they're peace plan a I Believe ... does exist or we should mention that does exist\nOr and they made a an effort I think in recent weeks to say that uh they do still plan on rolling it out\nOr I think they're going to wait eight till after the American mid term elections next month but I think more importantly I think they're going to to wait till after any uh early Israel Israeli election here in the spring\nSo I don't think that's imminent uh but but in a sense of uh you know Palestine reconciliation a Hamas and Fatah\nA over Gaza that's also been in the works but\nIn recent weeks that's kind of been in a dead horse a you know there's no real movement on that Abbas has has done in a Hamas has shown no inclination I Am it's done to to soften its missions so that's kind of a dead end as well and then\nI think overall diplomatically and as you mentioned economically our students have just refused to to re engage with the Americans so that makes it a bit more difficult to kind of get anything moving\nThey cut off his money ... anywhere now we have about twenty seconds\nOr it doesn't quite yet the Europeans as well as somewhat the Arabs have kind of step into the breach a but it is concerned it's a concern that a financially the PA will\nUh will get into trouble and then that'll dictates a kind of stability and security on the ground and that's a huge concern a little reasons for for Israel and the security

of Austria Hungarian war planning\nBefore Nineteen fourteen was that the great war would be against the Russians and even if they were able to fight with the serves the Russians would intervene and so the bulk of their strength would have to fight the Russians and so they had pondered\nHow the the relatively small Hungarian Army fight the vast Russian Army\nAnd this is a this is a really a perplexing problem for the Austrians because the Russian Army is going to advance on a very broad front from the Baltic Sea all the way down to the to Ukraine\nSo all the way down to the Easter so where to where it can the Austrian strike with any hope of victory well there was no hope of a victory in the sense of breaking through or sweeping around the Russian flank and marching to St Petersburg\nWhat's the what's the Austrians always plan to do is to give the short sharp jab at the Russians and knock them back and inflict heavy casualties and tear up their railways and retard

John ... professor Jeffrey wireless here Matt ... to me in the book and please forgive me professor for interrupting but I Want to introduce one of your major sources here Stanley Washburn who was traveling along with the Austrian arming a and his reporting\nOn what he saw a ten acre law where the Austrians were destroyed by the Russian artillery you just mentioned the hundred and fifty thousand casualties in this very small space because the Austrians wouldn't learn\nThat you don't charge into our artillery fire that's as many as were lost by Lee and meet at the battle of Gettysburg Washburn when he reported back to America was America gas to these numbers was it frightened by\nNot particularly because they they were seeing similar casualties on the western front so taken together western and Eastern Front Ah yes America was definitely a gas the America was determined to remain neutral and the conflict or not least because it was largely immigrant nation\nThe bulk of whom had recently immigrated from Europe in part to escape conflicts just like this one\nBut there certainly was a sense that this was war on a scale never seen by any nation in the world\nAnd uh you know the battle that Washington is reporting on this ah ten acre lot he's referring to the battle of rubber ... which is a very it's it's the biggest battle the Austrian Hungarians a fight in the in in the first World War\nAnd I've been around ... I was there in twenty twelve or and it really is a ten acre lot and it looks exactly like today like it did then ah just open fields of waving grain and basically what happened there is the uh you know the the the Russians wrapped their superior numbers around this\nShrinking ... after a Hungarian Army and just pulverized with artillery just little strips here and there where they've been blasted by the rushed by the Russian artillery and he found it you find it incredibly moving the the scenes of these little clusters of Austria Hungarian quirks as you know bunch together and slaughtered by the by the Russian artillery\nThe Russians pushed the Austrians out of not only ... which is to the north but also out of ... the fourth largest city and all of the hops Berg empire they burn their food is they're pulling back\nThey lose a thousand locomotives Fifteen thousand rail cars an enormous amount of wealth passes into the Russian hands and the Russians do not have a superior army will see that when we come to the Germans attacking the Russians in Poland meantime ... is trying one more time in the south takes Serbia\nHe will go up the hill as many times as he can find truth and again he slaughtered I think he loses forty thousand the frustration here I Won a race to the Germans Jeffrey because we know they're watching misinformation come from a come in from Australia and they're losing heavily in\nFrance at the same time you write that they are dumb with amazement did the Germans have a plan when they read these things or were they going to make it up\nWell the the basic plan of course was the ... and plan which held that the Germans would defeat the the French and the British expeditionary force in forty two days\nAnd then transfer everything east who to join the author Hungarians against the Russians that was the basic plan\nBut then because of the transition from the war of moving to the war of trenches on the western front of the fact that they were not going to be able to defeat the British the French within forty two days and we're going to be locked into a long war of attrition\nThey were they were compelled merely to send reinforcements to the Eastern Front and try to bolster the Austria Hungarian the Germans were deeply upset because um\nThey had a they suffered a Russian invasion of the beginning of the war that coincided with the with the German invasion of France\nBecause um they had a they they suffered a Russian invasion of the beginning of the war that coincided with the with the German invasion of French or they'd they'd lost a battle in American looting guards\nWere sent out and then they inflicted the the the brutal defeat of town in Oregon the Russians in August Nineteen fourteen which through the Russians back in time for the Germans\nTo ah you know continue trying to defeat the French and the west but also by the time for the Austrians to gather themselves and the German the Germans were just absolutely thunder struck that the Oscar Hungarians are proving so incompetent\nLet's go let's go to war against the Russians with Lou ... this is November Nineteen fourteen the book

dissatisfaction\nThere's they did with a unrestricted submarine warfare the big difference was Bucky didn't kill anybody but the the the unrestricted submarine warfare did\nAnd so there was a big moral difference there but as far as training with the Germans is concerned\n[noise] unless you were British sympathizer in the United states you knew you didn't care you Germans live your thought it was a wonderful thing and um if we if you if America not allowed them to to trade with them in some way of with the submarine thing for example that would have been a matter of for\nLack of neutrality

situation or off the pharaohs that a critic did the first time and he probably had the same situation where you tried to dive as it was a crash diving in in the navy I guess\nIt has a crash time and they lost control of boat in in his case he didn't recover and they didn't hit bottom and they just went right down the bloated that's the best guess there's no indication that she could have had in mind somewhere but\nThat roe was on mine so it's unlikely that they hit a mine and the nature of the conditions where they call a submarine warfare\nSurface ships attacking you submarines was not well developed in the British really didn't have much of an atheist W.

go to a Red Sox game back in the day when I was a kid and you have Fifteen dollars into the stands at the most of the most and that that was on a good night my\nSo what do you sit anywhere and you'd sit in the stands\nAnd so you'd have a these wouldn't seats on either side of you and you would bang the seats and they would do this chance we want to hit we why is that right yeah and it sounded like you had because everybody was doing as everyone who everybody was banging the empty seat next to them\nAnd it sounds like a ... it was it was it was quite a thing about social was\nVery effective I mean when you look at the lineup in those days you had a couple of you know pretty slick hitters like Frank Mal's own but was it was a lot of depth she loved to twenty hitters in the old the red Sox fan let alone the pictures just these worn out cars that they got off the the\nThe heap [laughter] so yeah so now we're used to a very competitive team and when they come up short people get upset now just just really wanted a little\nBack to the day when you get banged me empty wouldn't seat next to you here's your money now\nI'm Jennifer ... with your money now China's economic growth sank to its lowest level since the global financial crisis in the latest quarter\nAdding to challenges for its communist leaders as they fight a tariff battle with Washington the world's second largest economy expanded by six and a half percent in the three months ending in September\nThat was down from six point seven percent the previous quarter and the slowest rate since early two thousand nine China's economy already was cooling due to clamp down on credit to rein in a debt bloomed before President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports\nMoving out to the community and doing other things together also I think that you know women like to congregate as well and do social things together and so there are a lot of activities\nThat bring people together at the senior center and so\nIf it's your first time at the senior center or you've been coming for a long time and there's always something new to try and people to me and a place where you can fit in a maybe develop a new hobby or continue doing something that you usually do alone but in a new way you know\nGo to the gym is an interesting thing for seniors you used\nTo go with sore thumb ah it's it's mostly young people in the old boss and you know a muscle tone and they're going to seniors want to stay fit to a lot of them so they don't really want to go down to the local gym with all the young pups will do the exercise program to heal over what we're really developing\nA lot of programs there's there's been a lot going on and I and I think there is something to meet most people's interest but I think it's becoming more and more apparent through research going on around brain health that being active\nIs really really important to keep your brain healthy and your body healthy and it and to sort of forego\nSome health risks that can come up as you age so being a member at the at the fitness center is affordable and we're open all day so really it can fit into your schedule very well to an orientation so you learn how to use the equipment and then there\nAre classes there's sort of all a cart that you can choose from so if if you are you're feeling like you need to start out slow there's something for that um if you really want to get in there and do something very active there zoom bust and\nLow impact kinds of classes where um people are really animated in building off each other's energy and\nHaving fun so you don't have to feel competitive or push yourself too fast there's really not that kind of element that you find at the gym where you may feel out of place or and behind the game\n... the director of senior services at the senior center in North Hampton mass\nI've talked to a lot of people especially older guys when they lose their wife or now their nutrition goes downhill they might have a total camp sardines for lunch or something like that can you help guide out [laughter]\nYeah so I'm working a lot on developing 'em food programming at the senior center and not only is important to have\nA well rounded meal but I think it's really important to eat together and not be eating alone all the time we don't eat as well when we were just taking care of ourselves we need to share food and community and the meal that we're serving right now for lunches at three dollar meal for seniors and it's very healthy\nAnd you can actually also take it to go so if you\nIf you want to take it home for dinner\nSo you don't have to cook later that that's also available we have a coffee shop and we're now doing\nFresh baked goods and we will be doing offering some prepared foods that you can purchase to go as well we have a farm share senior red bag farm share available on site during the season where people can come and really we have our own little farmers market inside the senior center which has\nBeen really nice for people so I I think that if if you're stuck at home 'cause you're not driving or you'd like to get out more you don't want to drive in bad weather you know you can come down on the van and\nGet involved in programming have a nice meal\nAnd meet some some people um and get involved in activities\nThat can really become part of a regular routine to you know not isolated at home or if you're recovering\nFrom surgery it's a great way to sort of fill some of those needs during a transition so we're down at sixty seven ... street contacts information for the senior center and you can find on the city website as well as call us at\nFive eight seven one to two eight\nWhat's the population now or you know I'm a baby boomer myself talking awful lot about this growing population of the baby boomers which we kind of invented you so it's hard to convince her boss was getting old we never thought that would ever happen but the what's the population right now the euro while they're over a thousand\nSeniors in North Hampton they've population is going to continue to grow and ... and tell twenty thirty five\nOur culture is going to change a lot as the the baby boomers get older or there will be a lot more seniors our culture will be primarily people over sixty they're less and less younger people staying around and also people are having less children so\nUm our culture is going to need to adapt to\nAll the changing needs and deal with you know holes in systems in terms of transportation and home care there are a lot more caregivers families who are raising kids who are also taking care of their older parents so I think there are a lot of needs that\nAre families have not just seniors but also families as a whole need support and isolation is really a detrimental things so being involved at the senior center can really offset a whole families need to care for its older family members\nMarie ... the director of senior services at the senior

got some public forums coming up yeah I have a proposal that north Hampton um\nWould ask the legislature to change the membership of the housing authority to add more tenant members I think that would result in better policies for the housing authority a lot of people who live um in public housing Northampton\nAnd to discuss it we're having to public forums one is a this Wednesday October twenty fourth at seven o'clock at JFK um and the other one is going to be um November thirteenth I'm In the council chambers but this one on Wednesday\nOf everyone shows up and gives their opinion especially if you rely on public housing or we'd love to have your opinion on this who's going to be representing the city\nI'm I'll be there it's organized by one of the council committee chaired by county sheriff community Resources Committee yeah um yeah and it's something where it's a big change and no other city has done anything like that so you want to have substantial input and communication from\n'em all the different people who are would be involved and affected by this but you know I think it's it's a worthy worthy discussion and it just might be possible so Wednesday seven o'clock at JFK\nVery good um the board of health the reason we just had a forum and they have a proposal to ban smoking in business district so we're basically downtown right to smoke out of business\nUm to listen to some of the people that do have their hearing or to their complaints were aired out and just hearing\nThat this is a major problem that the one person says she has to cover her mouth all the time when she walked on them because of all the smoke and the other person says that they're allergic to cigarette smoke um what's your take on this\nIs something that's going to come before the council no it doesn't come for the council I suppose the council could do it if we want it but the the board of health is taking the initiative on this you know they previously banned it banned smoking in parks I Believe in in certain other places now it's been extended pretty much all of downtown and all of downtown Florence\nUm you know it's an interesting question I mean it's it's a it's a public health issue obviously and the you know I guess my position is that uh if if a society wants\nTo they can set rules protect public health\nUm my questions will be more logistical um how do you you know are we going to force this who is going to force it is it going to be practical how much are we going to spend enforcing it but I you know I don't know I think tobacco is had its day and I'm sure we needed\nAll over the place I'm so you know yeah but you know it's one of those things which I'm Glad the boy was holding these forums because you know it's usually if you make a decision like this you wanted to kind of democratic\nAnd when the boy the boy health could just do it as ... without any Republican put and that will be troublesome I worrisome to me but the fact that means poke forms is good so we'll see I guess where the conversation goes\nIt's it's funny when you think about that too when you think about smoking you you don't think about smoke outside as anything like that yeah I mean it just goes into the year just 'cause I mean I'm not I'm not cigarette smoker myself\nBut God it wasn't that long ago that to take the cars that for instance this would have been before my time what everybody who warned them because that would have been smoking at their desk in okay every office building in we're not going back very far away I go back in about twenty five years or every office\nBuilding in this entire city what have people smoking at the desk all day long and then we talk about Fenway\nPark last night with a big victory or not if every part by ... o'clock and general\nEverybody will be smoking in memory mark cigars pipes and cigarettes all over the place\nAnd ah it's a smell that it's still in my memory yeah to but again this is an outdoor places you don't think of it in the same way as smoking indoors you\nKnow I guess not and you know I guess you you can't just drink outside either you know I guess for whatever reason we've made these rules for that kind of the common area and ah but you know smoking I think there's a real health issue there you know second hand smoke and\nI'm just as you know I guess you have to think about if you're outside and you know ... people who don't have a choice if they encounter smoke you know I guess so that's relevant\nUm the whole thing for me I think it's gonna be process and uh the questions of of enforcement I guess for Smith thing would be tricky because now you're actually getting\nErect tickets and ... one guy said that one guy who who's allergic to a surrogate cigarette smoke yeah Eliot de ... so I guess his name but he's not in favor of this because it's a further criminalization of homelessness are like us I guess a lot of homeless people are associated with smoking cigarettes\nThat's a concern to absolutely I mean is I I Would hope the motivation is not just about folks who um\nAre are often spotted downtown you know in certain locations I Hope that would not be the motivation I'm a little suspicious of that myself I got it might be watched the behind all this but I wouldn't blame people for feeling that way I you know I don't know what the what the truth is or not but um [noise]\nUm and then I guess what's another I mean I assume this extends to like vaping I assume it extends to to pot with a lot to do that you know as soon as ... and that was actually an issue that people brought up in the city council um when we talked about zoning for a recreational marijuana\nSo anyway um it's it's a good question and I guess you have to make sure that there aren't unintended consequences but you know I look I don't think we need tobacco everywhere in our society ... I don't know I I guess and also we're just we're just talking about the downtown business district so I guess that\nMakes sense you know I Know not talking about public property were excuse me private property we're not talking about you know places that are far away from everyone else we're talking about the center of downtown so\nHey you know what this discussion was gonna happen eventually\nWasn't ... I Know that would cure the thing that would always curious if I was a cigarette smoker the thing that would it be cured me years ago would be having to go out on winter day and go out and the loading dock to ... because you can't smoke inside any more so you'd have to go and look that we're short me on\nOh would be having to go out on a winter day and called him a loading dock ... because you can't smoke inside any more so you'd have to go in all of that would have short me on their own but everybody else\nThough where that would have done the trick where we should have a public municipal loading docks twice the size of your average loading docks where officers can gather snacks ... oh you do your regret place for politicians to campaign do me a lot of people would be there\nAnd put the small people look much like Calvin Coolidge who cornered the ... vote\nGo dirt poor [laughter] it examples in America so much like you would think that people that were\nOr you know allergic to cigarette smoke would also be allergic to the smoke from chimneys in cars so I don't know you know I don't know his own anyway Ryan O'Donnell has been with is the president of the north Hampton city council thanks for coming into our textbook took her\nWe have a twenty nine and our morning here on one on one point five W.

as we've argued into or discussed on the show here how really into the Nineteen eighties you could work at minimum wage job and pay your college debts and you would not meaning to you could pay for tuition\nAnd fees and you could graduate debt free and now it is crippling as she writes that that could mean ... ... were can remain crippling well into adulthood so um this brings us to the governor's race I'm Jay Gonzales and Charlie Baker\nAnd it's something I Want to highlight because Baker I and I should say I have the vice president of the mass Teachers Association and we have endorsed Jacob dollars\nI think one of the main reasons we did that is I'm not just because he's my height or I tower over him you know as a five foot six men\nBut rather that he has made clear the central goal is to raise progressive taxes in order to invest in public education and attain um debt free public higher education something that Alina felons Willis two pieces as far out of reach\nCharlie Baker and this is a classic Charlie Baker move which is to say oh I've invested more than ever in in public education and I made public higher education\nMore affordable than ever and in his signature program um is something called the commonwealth commitment and we've talked about before the show because\nIt was ruled out you would think it was the most cutting edge far reaching effort in the entire country to make college more affordable um which is not which is not it's not even close and so this is just a really important uh it's a reveals\nBakers smoke and mirrors is what is the kind of a commitment says if you follow this prescribe route and I'll get to what the how complicated and windy that route is\nUm you can get you can get a discount on your tuition and if you follow exactly the pathway indeed you can you can ... you can save several thousand dollars off of a four year degree nothing wrong with that however\nIt is it requires you to have gone to a community college fulltime done well gone would go right to a four year\nCollege to major in certain um certain majors and on and on and on to the point where out of a hundred and fifty thousand college public college students in the commonwealth\nThe number of commonwealth commitment participants is four hundred four hundred for zero zero total total\nDebt free public higher education for massive reinvestment are public transportation system because he won't believe he doesn't believe in the taxation necessary to accomplish right because of the goals\nIn that way he's very much like you look at Romney's is it died in the wool Republicans and says rich people deserve to have their taxes lowered even though I and I find this so short sided is the fishermen\nAre some iteration of it were to pass and persons who make\nOver a million dollars earn over a million dollars per year where to pay a little more money they would never notice but if they were to pay a little more they would actually earn way more money\nBecause of the benefits to the commonwealth to the our commonwealth that is increased by having a workforce where people are not starting out in like\nThirty forty fifty thousand dollars in debt that will they'll hobbled them the rest of their life where we have an educated work force that is really in tune with the needs of employers and the twenty first century I mean we create vast wealth\nBy taking a little bit of money from the wealthiest and using it for this purpose public higher education and the transportation infrastructure the billionaires will be richer but\nNo better shortsighted and say no give me a tax break\nThis you know Massachusetts Miracle if you want to call up that the the economic boom which is not shared equally at all\nIs depended

these years I still have to warn you about foreign lottery scams today's Clark rage [noise]\n\nAren't we just a moment [noise]\n\nWith all the publicity that surrounds state lotteries surrounds the\nPowerball and what's the other one called mega millions I think whenever I don't play lotteries anyway there are a lot of people who are really end of this kind of thing and particularly people that are older\nFor decades had been swindled by a con artist usually overseas\nYou generally outside the reach of US law enforcement\nWho conned them into believing they've won a pile of money in a foreign lottery\nOr they used to be referred to a as I remember years ago they were overwhelmingly a British watery scams\nThat people were getting calls saying they'd won the lottery in the United kingdom or this winter that one or the other one from Germany and then there are a lot of them that were um callers from\nUh Europe or Africa saying that people one lotteries and more recently it's been out of the Caribbean and regardless of where they come out of the Caribbean they're referred to as the Jamaican lottery scams or Jamaica\nIt's packed with us and\nActually a lot of them do actually operate other Jamaica telling you that you would have won this lottery and all you need to do is pay for as it's been all through the decades pay for their taxes to get your winnings\nAnd\nPeople do it again and again and again\nNo matter what the pitch no matter where in the world that comes from and what I Need for you to know as as your parents' age\nYou got to get more involved over time they may have more time on their hands they may be getting lonely and they may be too trusting you got to be involved there's even a federal law now\nTo help federal prosecutors prosecute these crimes because they are such a continuing problem but catching the bad guys\nIs so difficult and the financial harm can be catastrophic because once they have an elderly person on the hook and they get him to pay any money they call again and again with story after story about why they have to pay more and more\nMoney\nSo it can end up being in the many thousands of dollars you know what's going on you know with my mom you may have heard me say my mom saying was different she was getting scammed by fake charities\nAnd we had to take her checkbook away whatever you have to do to protect your aging loved ones do it you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I or a from Augusta precious metals\nGet the finite and is with the actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match\nLike greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're going to match with a dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you with my kids even the usa spending card was not nearly as effective teaching the finite and has some money as cash\nGrayson is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Grayson how you doing\nHow's it going Mr Howard oh great but please call me cart\nAlright clerk I'm I have a question for you I Am in high school are about to go to college and I just wanted to know what I should invest in 'cause I'm thinking about investing about a hundred dollars a month\nAnd I want to start investing mhm\nOkay so [noise] most people going to college you're only spending money how are you in a position you're going to be able to invest you working while you're going to school\nYes sir I have a part time job right now and when I'm In college I uh I Hope to get in to another part time job\nWow so for example you so you're like Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nYes there wow okay we're not related are we\n[laughter] no I don't think so\nBecause I started my first IRA when I was Nineteen years old because I really was working while I was in school and so the beauty is that when you put money aside as a late teens or in your twenties the money has a chance to grow and grow and grow his time as your friend your ally\nAnd because you're working the something called a Roth IRA which would be my favorite place for you to look at stashing you're a hundred dollars a month\nIf you've ever heard of ... you know what that is\nI'm not sure what the differences between a Roth IRA in a regular IRA\nSo a without a clear age you don't want to do a regular IRA because you're not going to a guy in a high tax bracket\nOr Ross IRA works backwards from a regular IRA regular IRA you get a current benefit on your taxes but everything that the money would accumulate over the decades for the next gosh forty years\nWould grow tax free but then every penny you'd end up with would be taxed with a raw that's the opposite you get no current tax benefit but everything that that money grows to be over the years becomes years tax free\nSo that's why I particularly when you're young doing the Roth is a vastly superior option\nIs er at Clark dot com I have information Grayson\nOn choices and like you to look at to put that Ross money and you can put in up to what you earn in a year but never more than fifty five hundred so you're a hundred dollars a month as long as you're earning more than that you're good to go to do the Ross\nAnd once you have a thousand dollars is really easy for you to open one of the really great Ross IRA investment choices\n[noise] okay\nSo Grayson if you go to my investment guy to Clark dot com I'll take you through how to set up the raw\nAnd then what you should invest in in that raw you know where you could do the raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and you're off to a great head start and I think that's really exciting\nYes sir I Want to start early just you know I can have the money for retirement\nWealth you start as early as you're starting you may be able to retire significantly earlier than most people are going to be able to do so good for you David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nClarke David\nYou're getting married\nI Am well congratulations to you\nThat they get so much a joke\nDavid you're getting married I Am well congratulations to you but\nThey get so much a June third oh [laughter]\nRight well you are now they're June wedding you know the people in the wedding business get overwhelmed every June\nAll of that [laughter]\nWell how can I be of service to you\nWell as the advice of any marriage counselor I think they tell us that you know it's important that we enjoying bank accounts and I currently bank with one of the biggest banks\nAnd so basically you know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for I Would say Ninety nine percent of all of our purchases and then you know what what we do and all the credit or we'd be at least pay off but\nRight now since we are going to be enjoying a bank shall we want to find the best and banks that's going to be for us whether it is with a major bank or something small you know we want to add that online banking option we\nStill want to have the option to be able to write checks if need be still be able to get cash from an ATM that's not gonna you know hurt us with the ATM costs and those sorts of things where we're overlooking for\nSo I got several things to say number one I normally don't recommend that you merge all your finances right away oh what I tend to white for a couple to do and I should ask first how old are you and your bride to be\nI'm thirty and she's a twenty nine\nOkay so you've been out in the world for a while that's especially when I don't like for a couple of emerge every thing especially not at the very beginning I think there's an enormous advantage and having his accounts her accounts and their account\nThat you have a household account where you take care of the household expenses like rent or mortgage uh utilities anything that is a obviously and expense of life living together\nAnd then that you eat to continue to have your own separate accounts as well and you agree up front how much each of you will put into the joint operating account because people come into a marriage with different ideas about money\nAnd I don't want you to be in a position where you assume one thing about her she assume something about you and then it becomes a flashpoint for disagreement about how each of you set your values with money and priorities\nOkay over time you may find that becomes necessary and you completely merge everything right but I think at first it's best to have his hers there's okay\nAs far as as where I like for you to look at putting money do either of you do much investing\nA I Believe a you know we are both worked for the state so we uh we uh we ... retirement system um and\nRichard don't you don't have like an investment account with the stock brokerage or anything like that no no no no 'cause that's my first go to is usually the best um accounts for checking and for ATMs and all that are with the stockbrokers but if that's not part of your life\nIn your state employees I Would like you to look at doing your joint household account with the credit union are available to you in your state to state employees\nOkay 'cause credit unions are owned by if you open an account or will be owned by you and your bride to be\nYou know you're you're an owner of the place so they're not trying to rip you off they're not trying to come on you and they're going to offer you a jet straight up deals at the credit union and you may have an office her office is right near the state facilities you work out\nOK\nSo that would be my favorite and over time you'll know when it's the right time for you to um jettisoned\nHaving any separate account of yours for having any separate account of hers oh here\nAnd it's usually really advise that you keep each keep your own account if you have really different ideas about consumption you know what I mean if one it'd be really loves to shop and the other would be happy never to walk into a store is that right either of your deals\nThe ... full of lessons for

or two in November he hauls three subsidized student loans when it's titled ... dollars he's never had any credit other than these loans and his credit score is fixed at each ... he\nHas the money to pay those in Seoul now but what's the best course of action to positively impact his credit score should he paid off in full or overtime\nAnd the laws so you said he says is six fifty two yes which may be enough of a score for him to get a loan limit\nA traditional visa and MasterCard or discover card so I'd like him to do that regardless of where we talk next about these three subsidized student loans\nAt home and I wished\nHe or you would have called me before he graduated 'cause then it's really easy to get a credit card [laughter] okay but it is he a member of any credit union is All right I'd like him to go to the credit union and instead of applying straight on line for a credit card talk face to face was on the loan officers\nAnd see what the likelihood is he'll be approved for a small limit these or MasterCard and if that doesn't get it done if they are like not quite there the six fifty where you are the next thing would be to potentially try a lower limit card with discover\nAnd\nIf all traditional channels fail and like him to try something called pedal card P. T. A. L. card dot com\nAnd it's a non traditional issue or a traditional visa cards and see if he can get one from them on the student loans with um federally subsidized student loans the interest rates now that he's going to be paying\nAnd when he would have graduated from school those loans are pretty low rates aren't they\nYes about four percent fell off\nSo that's really lucky you know people taking out student loans now federally subsidized or an subsidize are paying higher rates interest rates have gone up so his timing was good and the eleven represents his entire student loan debt\nYes that's fantastic he gets ... well that is\nGreat so it'd be has cache he could pay them off but ah at the interest rates they have there may be other priorities like what kinds of things\nIs he having to do right now like his he asked me to go rent an apartment or is he needing transportation like what's going on in his life let's say in the next Eighteen months to two years\nHe's killing him so he's enjoying being rent free for right now I'm an transportation is taking care of so he does not have as it's apples right now\n... what point are you going to charge him rat\n[laughter] maybe [laughter]\nEven even a token amount of rent I think is good for somebody to be paying who's now graduated it has a job\nEven even a token amount of rent I think is good for somebody to be paying who's now graduated it has a job yes yeah so um I think that's that's good and I hope you've set ground rules for him\n[laughter] yes okay All right you can tell I'm a parent of of kids who've been through this right yes\nSo if there's nothing specifically that he's trying to save up for anything like that and he's got the fines eat four percent even\nJust go ahead and and I encourage him to wipe out the student loan debt a path and be a you know he's starting off in a new job finishing college being totally debt free will be wonderful ... but but I Am off for he pays them off\nI wanted to make sure you can get one of these credit cards Alameda and then follow through the student loans and he'll be good\nMosley is with us on the car coward show Hi how you doing\n[noise] good afternoon clerk\nHow can I serve you today\n[noise] everything is Clark number one I heard about your health care so I'm Glad to hear that you're back to health or serving\nOh well thank you are somehow the fact that I had wrapped do my closest says just reemerged I don't know if if it popped up did you see it on the Web or something because several people have mentioned it again just recently and that was\nUm a year and a half ago and it was it was a pretty scary thing for a while but I'm fully healthy again thank you\n[laughter] do um secondly a militia groups you for a while but follow somebody who was your vice or I have a hundred plus critical what all three agency so thanks for another good information\nYou know that makes your score higher than mine [laughter]\nAnd just recently and you're you're above me right now\nFor me to get through the revenue where you're at so\nThey're okay\nBut my question is this I'm I'm about twenty thousand dollars left on a car loan\nUm uh some credit cards were putting limits on one of them will take care of most of that low solves considering doing a balance transfer to get the answer is down to zero of pain that off but I Want to get their life on that\nSo you can do is zero balance transfer no four percent fee for doing the balance transfer\nThere's like a three percent transfer the but no interest or a certain amount of time out to them\nSo you get like Eighteen months zero percent or so where\nWould you be able to wipe out twenty grand in Eighteen months\n[noise] no but my player was to follow their process again when you go and go into town and zero percent I'm Tom Sawyer PR to just do that transfer again\nRight how long do you think it would take you to take out the twenty thousand\nUm is up there that it's ... it will be four years so I Would say less I was sued for two\nOkay 'cause I'm trying to gauge what's the best idea of what is the interest rate you have on the car at one\nPoint\nWhich is not a terrible rate is that issued by a car dealer a bank or a credit union\nA bank okay are you a member of a credit union\nWith your credit score a credit union may take that loan out at two point something percent\nAnd that would be better than\nYou doing the zero percent transfer paying the three percent the up front and knowing that of clocks ticking it whenever the zero percent runs out you got to try to figure out how to do something else again I'd rather it be simple and if you were to take\nThe twenty thousand on the car alone and go into let's say a two or three year car loan ... with a credit union you may get a rate low enough that that will just work for you\nConsider that\nYou have credit unions do a big business\nAnd refined car loans cause roughly I'm somewhere three quarters eighty percent of people finance a vehicle after dealer and the dealers mark 'em up and stuff so credit unions pretty easily can re fi somebody into significantly lower rate usually\nThan what they've got in the loan they originally took out by the vehicle\n[laughter] that's awesome low you know the answer though that's what my credit union today\nAnd see since you've got this what's known as a golden credit score once you're above eight hundred known as the golden store you'll probably you'll have people at the credit you saying hey how about we borrow money from you mostly\n[laughter] flicking always live [laughter] because you got it so together that is for nominal\nThat's fantastic to have such a great credit score so good for you that comes with how you handle

great thank you happy anniversary\nWell [laughter] I appreciate that it's not quite an anniversary yet but we're not only in the planning stages are coming up in November and how many years and yet\nWhile where it where it's a big number then so what I've done the previous anniversaries I'll probably set the bar just high enough to ensure there might be another one the next year so I Want to do I want to go a little bit beyond that this year\nWhat are you thinking\nWhere we're actually thinking about taking a nice trip somewhere haven't really decided exactly where but we are considering locations maybe in the Caribbean or um Costa Rica what we're looking at maybe doing an all inclusive resort high vacation but not really sure where to start\nWhat month of the year would you take the anniversary trip it would be in early November oh you are a genius does your wife say that does she know you're a genius\nYou know if she does she she doesn't like them to tell me that too often so can you from getting too big of a heads up\n'cause you know when you look at November for fun in the sun and Costa Rica Caribbean you were off off off off season\nBut I like to hear so\nFor fun in the sun and Costa Rica Caribbean you were off off off off season\nI thought I like to hear\nSo your timing is ideal and being able to find a all inclusive that would be a reasonable price should not be a terribly difficult thing doing that trip in early November\nOkay now would you recommend going going straight to resort to book the logistics are going through a travel agent or\nThis I think I can

that that they get you to places going to be a good experience\nI think it's worth it\nRight grades kinda by down some of that risk associated with the planning this big big event so\nYoung lady who

one thing to be mindful of staying out of what's referred to as the hurricane belt and November you're still and the edge of hurricane season and I would be mindful of that in where you choose\nOkay

Eric how're you doing\nClark or thank you for taking my call and thank you for your service\nAbsolutely you're moving\nWe are going to be moving or from the east coast to the west coast\nFrom where the where where specifically are you going\nFor going to be going into a little town outside of Sacramento called Grass Valley California and\nA station that I don't know if I'm On there anymore they're transmitter is in Grass Valley\nOh you're kidding now oh that's great and where are you moving from from a little burn Wilbur in Georgia right outside of Atlanta right that is quite a move now you know the greatest trade you get is you're going to have in and out burger\nYeah but we'll get a bad fall a whole lot less for our house when we go out there\nThat is so true well how can I be helpful with this move\nWell I have a a few questions related to that first of all I did go over your website and a couple of other places trying to do my homework one of my questions is about a full replacement value insurance coverage\nAnd I know that the moving companies are supposed to provide you with that insurance [noise] um\nNo no they they can sell it to you right now I'm invited to you\nRight provided with a charge yeah\nMy one of my questions was are there any uh reputable third party insurance carriers where I might find some competitive or rates for that\nPrice so you own a home yeah in Georgia and you're going to be buying a home in California your homeowner's ensure now they don't cover\nWell that's what I wanted to talk about some do some don't but those that don't actually say it differently typically insurers will but you can't count on that and the number of the mass market homeowners insurers no longer cover your possessions on a move\nBut they will sell you was often called a writer or a floater\nThat is like a temporary add onto your policy that will cover your possessions when you move\nOkay I'm should ask your is this thing and sure\nIf they offer 'em moving rider and moving floater\nOkay and if they don't are there any other a third party insurance companies that one could approach for this kind of coverage\nI have not heard of that I'm not but I Will tell you this when you get to your new home and ensure who doesn't even cover your possessions when you move isn't insure you probably have gotten all the information needed about and you should kick him that occur\nYou should fire yes okay\nCompletely so as far as the alternative that principle alternative and there is a third party when I'm not familiar with it the principal when is to buy replacement value coverage\nFrom a reputable moving company I'll talk about reputable ones in a second but I like for you to take on a couple of hundred dollar deductible on that because they don't lower the cost of that policy that you're that you're a central your own insurance company for the first two fifty\nOr five hundred dollars of items that got lost one broken whatever okay so would you add them moving companies the industry that has to be\nMy next question for the industry has a lot of ... that are sometimes they're absolutely operated by the mafia\nOther times they're just really crooked people and then other times they are more in a gray zone they're just not any good and so there's a program that supposed to separate out diligent movers called the pro\nMover program have you

substantially that I bought two years ago\nWhile you know graduations to you yeah I think you know\nI Will say that we got it for a great deal also and the county we bought a dental is kind of on a first time homebuyer go with us so we were actually able to get the home for Seventy seven thousand three bedrooms here that two thousand seven built on for Seventy seven thousand which ties with a great deal in our area\nAnd the owners now appreciate it to about a hundred and ten thousand so\nWe're at a point now where we would like to sell\nBut we're not sure what to do with what the money once we had it in hand so because we only have about fifty eight thousand like about him as we did a substantial downpayment so we're left with fifty eight thousand to pay and\nThen after you know we're after expenses you may clear somewhere right around fifty thousand dollars actually exactly right I Need to ask one question before we go forward\nWith those government subsidized first time
