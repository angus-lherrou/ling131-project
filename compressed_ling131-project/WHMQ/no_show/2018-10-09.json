what Shabaab is both a\nYou know indigenous insurgency but he's also result Titus branch in Somalia so\nYou know it's it's not one way or the other it's both Shabaab is you know local insurgent group

articulate when we use drones knees are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election or just saying that the Taliban is going to disrupt it is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the Taliban Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what's the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do\nYou know early this year the state department actually called on the tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for about ... and to get out and vote and become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the tall blond there's no evidence that the Taliban is willing to lay down its bullets for ballots I mean this is just mindless rhetoric really\nIn any event this new I'm Calvin theme of the came out just today emphasize the fact that they reject the Afghan Afghan elections which are coming up on October twenty if I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected by numerous grounds they they claim that the elections are basically just they sort of a publicity stunt for the foreign forces meaning of the U.S [noise]\nThey really reject the legitimacy of the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that Taleb on I'm like the Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and if they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of the rhetoric of the Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections as your your civilian or otherwise\nThen you we have the right to kill you and so the Islamic state has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking part in elections where's the top on because they're a little more sensitive toward sort of how they're they're perceived publicly and in terms of popular appeal at least one I put a little bit of a shrine on their sort of their violence\nBut the Taliban is against the elections not correct ... they're not they're not in no way in ... after\nThey couldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point John ... the whole us strategy in Afghanistan is about right now we we call it a strategy is about trying to get the Taliban lay down its arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy of the Afghan government and participate in the political process\nYet they couldn't tell us anymore for any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government and the political process and it's against the ... votes against religious obligations\nAnd that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nA bill I checked with you on your sources right now this Afghan national election it's a lining up to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much\nIn the old days you remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in in in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right Afghan officials are saying it is\nThere a lot of places are not going to be open right that these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly offices that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and I that as a major failures seven years\nAfter the U.S invasion that you know it's the security situation is worse than a than at any point and that polling centers on the open in Afghanistan to represent the will of the Afghan people that the Taliban are very clear that that government is\nThe gentleman that eight ... elections is illegitimate and the electorate looks legitimate when they open polling\nBill Roadshow and Tom chops and senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep the long war journal Afghan national election democracy

Arab powers he's also ended up with Mao era instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants this really I think is an indication that we are going to go back to the intense political

meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials do in mid October so not only of the ... stop\nGordon and Secretary Mattis canceled his visit to China but there will be no conversation between diplomat if I followed this reporting\nYes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said that their top but had an old would not be available um and so you know this is and also they pulled the admiral from meetings he had in the U.S [noise]\nSo really what the US was reacting to was China a centrally cutting off the milk Tamil discussions\nAs we pointed out before these milk Tamil dialogues benefit China much more than the u._s. so for Beijing to cut them off shows temper tantrum shows

a weekend visit to young young uh uh my um Palestine young young but there's an upcoming conversation between Pyongyang and Moscow and Beijing I think Ken is going to participate in that\nThe puzzle here Gordon is with this deterioration between the U.S and China where does that lead moons utopian and some is is is Korea now collateral damage to ... a temper tantrum\nWell you know it could be John you know a lot of people have said we've had simply this ideology for for decades that you've got to be nice to the Chinese and they will reciprocate\nWell you know President Trump explicitly try that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea well they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work but it can't\nIn past I think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks really imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Korea's for\nViolating sanctions for doing all the rest of it\nYou know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as disagreeable if that is\nYou know we've tried the other approach and its miserably failed that's made the Chinese even worse than they were before and so you know we are the author of almost of Chinese aggression and it's not like we're the aggressors but nonetheless we made it easy for the Chinese to be a embolden and to try to take down the international system\nMoon Jae in is the president of South Korea he has made it very clear he wants to reunite the peninsula\nA quote today and this story from Beijing a new order is being created on the Korean Peninsula Gordon is it is mood on yesterday's news or is he part of the problem does he worked for Beijing or does he work for Seoul\nNo no he works for appearing young um if you read the rest of what Moon Jae in said when he spoke to a hundred and fifty thousand North Korea is in the stadium\nYou know essentially it was written by North Korean propaganda is um and so essentially we've got a South Korean president who I I don't know what you said John but what he's doing is sort of hurting his own freedom his own democracy his own society here in the nation he's supporting his own nation\nAnd so regardless of what he thinks a you know some people say he's a communist some people say worse I don't know but I Do know that he's dangerous

J. all the great places Great Lakes and veteran a recovering politician a veteran now the U.S Congress\nLiving through the highs and lows midterms in the twentieth century gentleman I turned to the cabinet matter not to re litigate but us lessons learned applied to the mid term the White House denied held a ceremony swearing in for justice Kavanaugh social justice Kavanaugh\nThe president a remarks I Want to apologize to Brad in the ... cat in our family for the pain and suffering you've been forced to endure use are under historic scrutiny where proven innocent said Mr Trump so lessons learned for the Democrats and the Republicans David is just back from Tennessee and I want to draw upon his\nInformation he did very careful reporting of the voters in Tennessee where there's a tight Senate race David lessons learned from the Kavanaugh matter as you saw from the distance of the middle of America lessons learned let's talk for the Republicans when did they learn about these last three weeks from these last three weeks could even to\nGet any jotted in looking in Senate races which are largely playing out in Republican states where the president is a well thought of the lessons learned was that this was a good exercise for them it it galvanized the Republican vote\nAnd the Republican vote that isn't necessarily the biggest cheerleader of president\nBut for them this went beyond that and it sort of awake in the interest in the mid term elections a lot of Republican that you know as as normal when you control everything there's less of a motivation to get out during votes begin with is just the way it is a angers more galvanized usually but this really angered a lot of Republicans\nAnd and so I think Democrats come out your worst for the where I mean this is what I saw in Tennessee\nIn talking to people in and observe aid um you just had a lot of anger and and a lot of people were telling me or you know at least a few that they might feel rather than they thought he was a good governor and who knows maybe they would have voted for maybe they wouldn't have voted at all\nBut at this for them a created a straight ticket for the Republican sort of election\nEllen house races it it could be a totally different story at the different Plainfield is largely largely in an upscale suburbs in all sorts of states including many swing state and blue states like California\nWe can ensure that you consume over thirty different fruits and veggies every single day are capsules are filled with one hundred percent real whole foods there isn't a single thing added to balance of nature products their peer we spent an incredible amount of time on the quality of our products\nWe do this for you we do it for our own families\nGive yourself a break and give your body what it needs\nCalled now to receive thirty five percent off your first balance of nature order go one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one or go on line to balance of nature dot\nCom used promote code John\n[noise] tag your it Marvin program your home for the resistance commentary conversations and common cause I'm Tom Hartmann ... program intelligent talk opinion and debate joined me every weekday known to three right here on WHM peace\nOne by one o seven five fourteen hundred and twelve forty may be [noise]\n\nHere's what's happening on the valley beer trailed new city brewery celebrating a three year anniversary and they want you to celebrate\nWith them on October third team they're going to have the largest was ever will be a brand new barrel a ginger beer and more new beers to be announced food trucks available as a little drunken Parsons celebrate every year anniversary of over ...\nGets a free valley beer ... in your story and you never miss another beer than\nMe in any any\nHabitats mission provide homeownership opportunities for low income families is unique choirs partner families working alongside them any volunteers reaching out to help them\nEach habitat partner family provides at least two hundred and fifty hour sweat equity\nFor physical labor for the construction around home other habits have family in special time\nEven though they sell their joint results not only in\nTown and work in may\nIf you believe everyone should have a decent place to live than homeownership bring strengthens ability to families and an everyone deserves the opportunity for a better future we could use your\nLet me down home home in unity in those camps and learn more today these ... that the habitat\nORG then John bachelor show\nOne on one by one owes some anti fourteen and twelve forty page him being [noise]\nI'm John that's with my colleague can cost and friends had his McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes recovering politician and we go to John Fund the national view on line and Fox television Fox News\nAnd David trucker CNN and the Washington Examiner urge to look at the midterms in four weeks time\nAsk the economy very good economy very very good economy insect so good that even the Federal Reserve thinks it's a good economy and will continue for some quarters hence in addition Russia gay big story two weeks ago\nLots of anxiety and now the president takes Rod Rosenstein on a ride for air force one so David back from Tennessee did you hear comments about the economy or comments about Russia gate as the voters considered the Senate race in Tennessee\nWell yes I Know a lot of Republicans that I talk to 'em want us to talk about the economy but\nKavanaugh what the dominant issue Russia did not really come up with it in fact it really hasn't been an issue over the past several weeks this\nIs another good reason why this cabin up there ended up to be a very good for for Republicans because all of that\nAll the things that rubs people the wrong way about Trump and and might depressed with the Republican vote we're off the table now I I still contend\nThat we've reached the point in the cycle where the economy is a much bigger story for Trump's twenty twenty reelection I think he can win them a lot of votes um that were reluctant Trump votes last time and might even when I'm a few more votes and it's sort of depends on who the Democrats put up\nUm if the economy was going to be the story that you know we might have soon from from his ... perspective on the on the economy helping the incumbent party\nI think that would have already been the dominant story the fact that we're still talking about another extraneous story Kavanaugh or as the one that's motivating Republicans and and my level the playing field here tells you what you need to know about its place in this race but in the next race it could be a very big deal\nMischief on the economy pocketbooks take home pay if it wasn't there we'd be talking about it it's there so we're not this is not merely a good economy this looks to be a break one and a great one that is the envy of the world the trade negotiations that are said to be a source of disruption or failure are not\nDamaging the stock market\nIn addition to the fact that the Chinese are having trouble a lot of trouble and it's obvious are having trouble nothing to do with us So Jon is that a factor in the mid term or is it all going to be about Trump\nWell until now it was all about Trump\nBecause he was always in the news and the economy was viewed as okay that's fine what have you done for us lately and what are you going to do for us in the future\nI think if the Republicans running more aggressive campaign and they can keep Trump quiet or at least disciplined for the next four weeks what will happen is a Republican attack on\nWhat the Democratic House or a Democratic Senate would do to mess up the economy so not so much taking credit for what has done but what threats exist raising taxes more regulation I'm\nBasically a more spending impeachment\nImpeachment which is a distraction that people don't want because they want the Congress to go about the people's business not a partisan obsession\nThis Mr Mr McCotter you have questions\nQuickly gentleman what are we make the Democrats with impeachment are they going to use as a hallmark as Mr nap seems to be saying or they're going to be more like the Democrats in the Senate or saying let's not must not be so hasty about this David\nOh look I think what you're going to hear from those Democrats as if they're going to use the the oversight power the Congress and\nWhat we know they will do is haul up everybody they can have testified before a a house committee they can somehow get 'em up there the subpoenas rolling by the truckload at the White House from the Democratic a house committee chairman that that's what they take the house they're trying\nTo shove this idea of impeachment of the Republican a fantasy that's been made up the scale Republicans into voting course Republicans don't need to create the fantasy anymore they got Kavanaugh to to do that job and and the only question is does that last or ten days from now we're we revert to what had been the meaning of this election cycle\nMr fund [noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their base can't help itself\nAnd the message that is going getting through a lot of the grassroots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about so the the the overall thirty thousand foot message\nIs responsible and prudent as David says but the message a lot of activists who sending an individual districts are uh we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nDavid I saw a news item and saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from the the the Democratic race and in Tennessee did you see that was that substantive or just a quick reaction well look\nI mean it's it's a major democratic group I'm part of the I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it just throw bread is a solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he doesn't need any money so if they're going to take ... to disown then you know that's fine as far as Democrats or his\nHe says John bon mentioned the based on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much set of Democrats wanted this is that\nJust like the Obamacare struck down in twenty Thirteen that the Republican base demand it or at least a portion of it that sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the big things that you're a minority should be able to do a lot more than I can actually do\nSo you do not believe that precedent Bredesen was hurt by that remark because he's no already ... TV\nIf anything it'd be a help I mean I run an ad say the liberals are just on it\nRight now I've got ... ... I recommend is reporting from in the Washington Examiner forests trip to Tennessee John Fund or the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes I'm John ...

WHM pie [noise]\nNot at all I'm a concerned about it\nBut the counter message ... measures and the U.S finding again today that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and counterterrorism strategy puts the focus on Iran and its proxies a Hamas and ...\nA John Bolton spoke about it today and very strong and direct terms in and said that I'm\nA radical Islamist terrorist groups are the preeminent transnational terrorist threat to the U.S\nAnd so the new threat at a new strategy to us includes pursuing extremist to their hopes and cutting off the\nSource of support\nI e some would say Iran\nFat is real and sees me you was also in many ways trying to incite Israel isn't it\nThe emu ... is is simply outrageous and given their failure to condemn you know we have this this situation in in the south it first of all failure to press the ... to go after the new nuclear sites that the prime minister cited\nIn his speech and the un we see a whole home reaction know\nVirtually no action and certainly no pressure\nOn the ... which seems to be ignoring the new evidence and and still trying to live by the myth that Iran has abandoned the nuclear program which is simply just not true\nAnd the ... use actions on on numerous fronts right now that we see their um unwillingness on the on on one hand to support us on the sanctions to stand up against Iran on\nThe other hand that they are are seeking all sorts of ways to uh to bypass it yet know condemnation of the ongoing fires smoke that Israeli children in the south\nAre having problems breathing that there's widespread people are forced to live and stay in their homes the economics of the environmental damage economic damage not one word on any of this and I think the reaction of the companies in Europe going against their their governments and saying we don't want to be part of any of this\nI think it proves that the U.S strategy was right we see that um\nIran is still counting on on the Iranians but they're not going to be able to deliver\nMalcolm ... ... C I Believe this is the road from Jerusalem to the dead sea to Jordan out of the river the Jordan River valley pass 'em and then you turn north for\nUh the west bank and then north of there for Israel areas the to my memory has been they've been building a road there for years you fly down there is nobody living on either side it's a it's a waste slam what's happened in Area C\nWell there's a little place called ... which are Europeans are today pressing their NGOs that government officials\nAnd it I mean they're trying to draw the borders for what they see as a solution the Israeli Palestinian conflict but they're focusing on this uh encampment it's a tiny encampment illegal\nA temporary structures situated just outside of Jerusalem that four lane highway that connects the Jerusalem to the dead sea and you have gone there and the Jordan River so\nFor for three decades or it's\nThis into a Palestine outpost because it's a very strategic position this is part of Area C which was designated and the Oslo Accords and for Thirty years by the court rules as fully under Israeli control this not disputed and yet\nThe Europeans have put up throughout Area C e flags they put up over fabricated huts like they're and they're claiming that these ... these buildings are schools so they can condemn Israel for knocking down in school when you know that these are little little hut\nThat they are claiming and a Palestinian NGOs primarily funded by European ... governments are spending millions to euros according to Charles Steinberg and other experts\nFrom European taxpayers to turn out propaganda in social media campaigns and um and saying that they oppose the efforts and these are all just saying they're going to resettle the people there they're not throwing them out there doing anything else and they're claiming that's a war crime\nSaturdays now some Malcolm in it all goes back to a blaming Israel for defending itself\nAnd it all goes back to the U.S and said earlier trying to provoke Israel this point in time why I Would argue minutes to draw attention away from Iran and to help further Iran's interests which again to me makes no sense why do you will be trying to help the number one state sponsor of terror is that just me\nNo it's not just you I think that that the failure to address the build up in Lebanon\nWhich by the way Shiites now coming out against because they've invested a lot in New hotels new facilities cetera in Lebanon don't want to see a war yet we see it the ... uh adding precision guidance\nAh putting a new more missile rooms and and a launching pad in the in in residential areas\nNot one word from the Europeans about that not one word about the increasing em arguments to to Hamas the the attacks\nAnd the weapons that they're sending across the balloons and the damage that they do all of these things go on answered and they they create these diversions to put the onus each time on to Israel\nWhen it's all it's doing is abiding by it's by the law\nMalcolm home line conference presidents major American Jewish organizations Thaddeus McCotter W.

L. C. S.\nIsn't that funny how that just rolls off the tongue now the A. L. C. S. I remember when they first came up with it when they first came up with the playoff system yes I'm that old I remember when this happened and uh yeah you didn't call it the Arabs see as you call it something else and move and then they kinda ... reduced it to the LDS nails his was\nSilly because it's too many initials for me it's the playoffs so anyway yeah the way I wouldn't say the Yankees are on the run and they get too much firepower for that um they got what ... I think it's going to me\nSo I guess ... to be back on the bench again because\nFor some reason the hottest hitter in baseball I guess won't bad against left handed pitcher but anyway\nUh what are the most I and as I said earlier I was a little bit outraged that they're not to play in ... and and do it struck me kind of funny because Alex core is a utility player himself when he is baseball career was as a backup you played two or three different positions and he was a pack of user back but the red Sox and uh\nSo you are hope that a backup player can make an impact well a backup player the ... coal to be a tremendous impact in the past couple of years especially the season\nUh you would have thought that he would be an ally to Iraq and but now you know and that's all managers do it but anyway they switched up last night and I kinda like it when they do this uh all the guys who were in the lab ... third base or\nA Christian Vasquez was the catcher in the course brought quote was the second\nUm well they've been in the mix the whole time it's not like they're all of a sudden you know drag out a mothballs they've been in the mix the whole time in the ... I was kind of admire the way the corps has ... the only time I criticize court was yesterday for not playing ... but on\nThe way he has done that it's almost like a youth ball team right everybody plays right and the reason why you do that it's not 'cause you're just great you know Democrats\nYou know you're all the Democratic coach a team or the way you do this because everybody fresh everybody's fresh and everybody's ready to go and all that that's why you play everybody so nobody just sits on the bench and and ... and then you know three weeks later you ask them to go out and pinch hit\nA that never works and it has never worked in baseball history and so I kind of like the way they're doing it it's it's a little bit like a you fall not all you've ball is done that way but\nSome coaches who ah have a little bit because of some kind of savvy in them and understand that uh\nYou're you're only as strong as you weakest link they like to play all the players so um so anyway that's it it kind of reminds me of that and since he is a utility player at heart Ellis Corey he would understand that and the plays the ... will make for use these to savvy as player on the team\nAnd he will make places no one else can make and sometimes he feels in at shortstop understands when the the runners what runners fast runner slow knows he has to gun at the first time seem to make many many many plays here\nAre probably no one else is paying attention because the people to comment on sports on the radio early to statistics so that's all they pay attention to\nThey don't even watch the game have you ever watch some of the the the knuckleheads that are on Boston radio if you ever see them at the game than ever watch the single minute of the game they're always on checking stats and they're always on their laptop so so that I don't know that kind of says a lot to be anyway\nAnd uh I remember earlier that ah you know when they were looking for a second baseman were door and went down\nAnd they had to go all and they had to bring up a you know a relic from the past ... kids will get sicker patients standing right there so I don't know uh but anyway so I guess we're feeling pretty good right now about the red Sox in their chances of going to the or you'll see it so that can change with the weather is so who knows\nUm by the way you can find a first person column a from me I've been doing a few of these lately anyway there's a ... spinach slam it and it just show up this Friday for the second annual pong off on his opponents of refugee resettlement that we did last year this is parmesan to\nIt's going to be ... and there's a picture of me you can see me I'm In action in action plane at seeing from last year's ... so you could see one of these state of the art tables you can see me at the table and the first person accounts that uh I Do uh that I did on the on this a column for the cars that she can go on because now you can\nGet the ah the hard copy as they say of because that that today and you can see me and I can I read the first ...

you'll find all the way to donate to the thing and we're going to be you're really going to do all\nOr one week was of course not even the beginning of adequate for a real investigation but uh that was the best they could get from a from Jeff Flake who is is not a hero in any way and he ended up ended up voting yes anyway\nYou a talk you spend the first third of this column on a Monday is cause that Josh are you talk about your own a day's in college and some of the things that you heard about some of the things that you witnessed\nOh yeah you know a ... and I went to a little United Methodist affiliated college in West Virginia I went to West Virginia Wesleyan College many many many years ago\nA and even at a school like that or you know I I I remember arriving the very first day and at one of the fraternities there was a big sign that said\nDon't worry dad will take care of your daughter so you know right from the beginning there was this sense of a predatory sexual behavior from the men being the norm and you know over the years I heard about so many things happening you know I was never in a fraternity\nOr I was never involved with with any groups of men who would do things like this\nBut on my own in my own dorm you know the column begins with a story from my own dorm literally right down the hall from me\nAnd I had heard some commotion overnight and then the next day I heard some of the creeps involved bragging about how they basically had a imprisoned this young woman or and just wrote in and told her she had to do sexual favors for them\nAnd you know I heard this guy bragging about it the next day a and laughing about it and she did manage to escape but what a terrifying situation in a dorm room you know there was smaller than this radio studio and you're sitting in a that was basically a you know a couple of twin beds and a couple a desk in a couple of little closet door\nTo be imprisoned like that within those concrete walls and you know she came there like in the aftermath of a date with one of these guys and there had been a lot of drinking involved\nAh the terror that she must have felt a and I I assume nothing like that it ever happened to her before she ended up dropping out of school nothing out of college because of it and it's shockingly similar to sort of an amalgam of all the stories about Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat happened with Dr Ford or what happened with the accusations of a gang rapes at parties\nUm it's like a combination of all that kind of stuff that that he exposed himself to one woman at a party\nAnd it just it brought back a lot of memories of that situation that we're really uncomfortable and and really horrible uh and it's something that that that one isolated incident where I was just peripherally and observer of it many years ago\nHis me that's something that\nHappens thousands of times a day it seems like all across America even now the UMass case from oh yeah a couple years ago or so and and those are just the ones that we know about you are so many of these things that happened individual women\nWho don't say anything because they're going to get crucified for it you know the idea that\nThe president of the United states and members of Congress would say well if she had said something at the time people don't say anything to know where they don't say anything because of exactly the response that they get from people like Trump\nYeah and and in fact most of the ... the young males involved in these sorts of actions are pretty well taken care of oh yeah you know they've got their ... of the community and their fathers are going to get them off and and all that so there's the deck is stacked against uses there's no way Thirty years ago that you could have come out and do anything about oh yeah\nAnd and back in college I remember the worst that ever happened or even when things would there were so many witnesses in so much information about it\nThe worst that ever happened was that you know it reminded me of Animal House or in a fraternity would be put on double secret probation or something like that and they were only allowed to get like ten new members one semester instead of twenty\nSo there were no repercussions now no one was ever kicked out of school and you know this this poor young woman withdrew from school none of the men involved I I ... well none of them graduated because none of them actually stuck around long enough to graduate and passing up\nGraduate but uh yeah they they never had any disciplinary action at all\nThe other thing that really struck me was when ... gives\nHer ... version of the events and then Kavanaugh's comes in\nAnd he's had obviously been coach she'd been coaching number one you've got to really display tremendous anger here new show your outrage at these liars so you've got to come right out and do that\nAnd secondly he starts crying so that was also coach and he was right out of Trump's playbook the worry is speech\nAnd everything that you gave blaming the Clintons blaming the Democrats as all big a conspiracy by by the Clintons yeah it was what other Trump it was written by Trump mhm and what do you want to see this oh no you're not\nThe only one who see that I see it too I I remember when he started I was thinking this could have come directly off of one of those All right ... uh you know talking about that this was all just a conspiracy to destroy his life because of anger over the election of Trump\nAnd uh what was a well funded left wing organizations and when he said a revenge by the Clintons or revenge on behalf of the Clintons or whatever the words were\nI just thought you know my immediate thought was the original title for this article which was Brett Kavanaugh disqualified him some that's disqualifying for the Supreme Court if you want to have even the slight appearance of being impartial\nYou can't just give it away like that and yet it didn't matter because Republicans were the ones nominating Republicans were the ones voting Republicans were the ones investigating a it didn't matter at that point because Republicans had rubber stamped him to be on the Supreme Court which honestly I don't understand\nThere are dozens and dozens of people who are more qualified than Kavanaugh\nWho will be just as anti abortion justice pro gun a justice anti labor all the things Republicans role and there's all the motion and pro Trump pro executive branch who could have been nominated who didn't have alcohol and sexual assault problems in their past an anger management issues to\nEven talk about the ... his assessment of where we did get very combative and all that and you said that you could easily see you could put your the combative ...\nDrunk so yeah the last ... remember you know just on that performance this is a man who's in public on national television and I assume sober he has every motivation and his wife to be at his very best and what he showed us was far worse than anything else we seen from him in public before\nAnd people kept saying you know this is a job interview you don't act like this was at a job interview and actually wasn't really a job interview it was an evaluation for promotion because he's already on the federal judiciary which is a scary and I thought\nUm but he was applying to basically be promoted from the federal bench to the Supreme Court and if you if I went into a promotion uh interview like that or an evaluation was supervisors or a hiring committee aboard a promotion committee\nAnd I acted like that I couldn't possibly expect to be promoted or in fact I'd expect to be reevaluated for the position I was already in it it was just disqualifying and yet the value waiters who had the votes where the Republicans so they rubber stamp them\nWe'll talk more about this with the John ... drunken abuses not belonging on the Supreme Court to Monday's a column in the daily ...\nAnd uh when we come back I Want to talk about the his uh emotional breakdown and compare that to a Hillary Clinton when she testified before a hostile Republican congressional committee and didn't go all we'd be

the the co-op here\nHave hired five refugees in this area because as you were saying off the earlier Newman you have a Ninety day window once you are resettled here to get a job\nAnd so why is this has been something that's been so important for river valley co opt to support the hiring of refugees resettling in this area\nWell our community as you know is very supportive of of refugees and um\nAnd we are always looking for employees and so it's a perfect match and I'm a working with Catholic charities we were able to um I get some a really great people and as you might imagine English can sometimes be a a difficult thing and then you add\nA English language in uh in retail natural foods collapse and you've got some other words that aren't like that comment\nI learned how to speak

TV square to Joe use and Randy ... from collective copies Randy is working on her job as a worker owner to be collected copies news from the world of collective copies and laborious press\nYes thank you bill I'm Randy from collective copies\nOf we're a worker own print shop and a publishing house now\nOr been in business since Nineteen eighty three\nUm all your typical print on demand projects business cards brochures pamphlets booklets you name it we do it ah posters banners\nIf you can think of it that's all we do as well as our newest venture into publishing self publishing print on demand books\nUm lots of exciting stuff going on there the big thing this year I think which is uh [noise]\nUh the biggest change for us as as a business that is now thirty five years old or a lot of our founding members and older members are retiring\nAnd thank you for the delicate phrasing of that really appreciate that\nAre are are retiring and those of us who were once a young a collective or not anymore and uh and that's been a real interesting\nThe with is the way in which we handle the turnover\nAnd had a hand off owners ownership I mean you all who have been there for a long time are the owners are have been the owners of collective copies of worker owned co-op right now new people come in and presumably they're going to the owners as well as from dilution of the uh ownership interest how does that all worked out\n... interesting question I'm so one of the things that was built into the bylaws of collective\nCopies as a worker owned businesses that are by an is only two hundred and fifty dollars\nThat is what you pay to get a share of collective copies and when you leave collective copies that is what you get back\nAnd so it was a way to build in not\nSelling out if it got to profitable and or the owners that were there when it was super profitable to cash out in cash in so uh the goal of collective copies that has to be a business that is there for\nThe long term that's rooted in the community which I think is a pretty big value of cooperatives\nAnd um [noise] so it's a way to ensure that the business stays there to be an employee you're in the workplace for the generations to come\nWe're going to take a quick break in our show here live from the river valley caught up in North Hampton this is our annual co-op show when we come back we're going to be

or owners things slightly younger than you see is okay so Jill how\nDoes it work for someone answering collective copies as a new member of the collective\nRight well a collective copies interviewed a number of candidates for their apprentice positions The Apprentice is that the job title that I have I'm an apprentice printer\nAnd I'm a parent is to each his my a fellow worker owners are there are currently co ah sorry eight co owners and I work with each of them they each have\nDifferent working styles different strengths that they bring to the cooperative\nWhoa that's such a cooperative just the way to put they all have their different strength\nAll of those supervisors or sure Francis apprentice what what is it what do they call it the people you were practicing for\nUh they are worker owners this were thrown OK mhm or printers also printers and members\nOkay so you were practicing their the war and the job how long does that position continue for\nThe apprenticeship last for up to six months or it can be a shorter generation that generally around six months at which time the\nIf The Apprentice would like to be considered for a ownership than the entire cooperative holds meeting discusses whether they would like to vote in that apprentice to become a co owner and the vote has to be unanimous I Believe\nFrom the ... us wow how many people do lifted go there are a lot of people they're talking about you or oh my goodness\nYes [laughter] I don't get to witness all of that I don't think that yes\nAnd this process let me go back to Randy a ... for a second this process actually works cooperatively this sounds to me like it's a kind of in the ministry of a difficult ... mystery to a difficult thing to do but you saying yes it works\nIt has to work because if it doesn't if we're hiring somebody who's going to be an owner of the business with us and so what we're basically doing is every one of us is voting to hire this person is our business partner and so if one person is not driving with this person than it\nWe're gr owners are there a collective copies there were eight right now worker owners or to apprentices who are on track\nAnd it's a very pretty brutal process to have to uh I got through to to go through and you have to have some thick skin and be able to take some criticism and and be\nAble to adapt to a work environment that really requires

annual co op show\nBroadcasting live from the river valley co op you're in North Hampton during the break we can send you to our\nConversation and this was a conversation about dollars money and numbers of Lyndon Andrew from car power you were the president\nExplain a little bit more about that to our listeners but he's not sure we made that totally clear the first go around how does it work the numbers out of the money work how does the money work in a cooperative that was the money work for your co-op in terms of the goals you ...\n... well I think I think for many of us what we were just talking about is that we're able to offer\nGood quality financial value to our customers to our members\nUm by collaborating with each other doing group buying so we were able to access better pricing I'm as Robin was talking about by buying together the food collapse are able to\nUm function as one larger store because they they combine their purchasing power collect power was able to raise that ten million dollars for\nUm financing nonprofit solar and community solar projects by partnering together with other energy cooperatives around the country so there's um by by\nWorking together we're able to access some of the scale that you need in order to get better pricing for your customers so say\nA person wants to become a member of car power and or wants to put solar on the house but doesn't have the financial resources to do that what does that person do\nUm well we we offer a one stop shop for people to come in and I'm looking at their homes look at their energy use and decide and figure out how to get off of fossil fuels in and save money in the process so\nUm we're able to uh we work with a whole group of installers and energy efficiency contractors um in order to bring down\nCan access better pricing and get really good value\nSo let me turn if I might from ... from ... power she's the president there too and it's a major ... who is worker owner PV squared ... square is part of this\nExplain how a ... explain how TV square works with other cops in power costs to provide these kinds of resources in the community\nOh sure yeah I'm ... so we are a member of a national purchasing coughs were work her own business um meaning you know you consumer clubs producer cops purchasing co ops in work off some were owned by the workers democratically governed by workers\nBut we're a member of other groups that were a member of a national ... called the advocates cooperative\nThis was a a co-op started by a company called ... solar in Colorado or work off\nAnd it's a ... of local ... so we are at a scale where we do our purchasing through this advocates cooperative um we're we're buying for manufacturers at the level of a lot of the big national international solar company so we get the same pricing\nOr we also use that go up as a\nBest practices and information sharing tool so we've done some organizing we've organized as power in Puerto Rico project to provide power in the wake of Hurricane Maria are and we also do\n... and you're you put solar power panels in Puerto Rico how does that work\nYou know there's a number of a portable power stations TPS was a term so it's a trailer essentially with panels batteries a water purifier lockers where you can charge is not a permanent solution that sort of a disaster relief solution that's portable or when it's not needed there it can move somewhere else as well\nI I interrupted you were saying more about the cooperative purchasing power of your co op with other cops to provide the same kinds of well who pricing is the big the big companies\nYeah so I mean that's equivalent first thing we ... we also used as ... as a information resource sharing so there's a lot of discussion of you know best practices with a regular type of technical question or how to create new business models a lot of information shared between the different co ops that are part of this larger person cough\nYou mentioned the big companies do they present an ongoing threat to local co ops smaller clubs like yours\nI think we're fortunate to be in Massachusetts one of the best days for solar in the country so it's very easy to save money here it's also very easy for businesses might have done to come in and set up and and try and do things here\nI think the working with someone local uh represents a really different value to people here people care about it and it also does make financial sense because you're buying into a a long term\nBasically power generation plan and you want to work with someone that you trust who's going to be here in five years even if the market changes um so ... that said yeah I mean there's there's a lot of people are if you want to talk so some of our solar you talked a lot of different companies are certainly competition but\nThe local companies use a provide a service that these big companies the big chain companies which will happily sell you a some kind of solar panels and a contract out of the big\nBox stores they can't you are for something they don't\nYeah I mean first of all we're base here so everyone I work with these are the people we see here in the grocery store river valley or frankly when you go up\nOr we want to be able to look him in the eye and and not Dr heads right so we try and get it right the first time we make a mistake we fix it you're not talking to a a call center out of state when you have a problem you're talking to someone who lives in the same town as you\nAre in any case the same neighborhood as me\nYes [laughter] you just have to get the solar Monti income [laughter] during the house I [laughter]\nA creative solutions\nTo the problem with ... lack of so are we going to move his house so let me turn if I might to Robin O'Brian from the putting the food co-op where she's the general manager\nBecause during the break we were talking about numbers Robin you mentioned I think quite amazing number involving the button a food co-op share that with our listeners if you would please\nSo we have Seventeen hundred members um and we live in a town of about twenty six hundred people so that's um I think probably one of the highest proportion of owner ... member owners to a population that a cop can claim\nAnd why does did or does that happen why does that how why\nWell in our town ... ... is the only grocery store and oh\nMy goodness these cops this monopoly or a new concept [laughter]\nUm\nAnd we truly are a hub we represent our community and and a lot of ways and we're very much involved um in ways of helping people close the gap on food access we are involved with the food shelf we um help out with that the school food pantry and a few other things\nWhile on the in the world of extraordinary number as I'd like to turn to show a printing who is the general manager of the river valley co-op where we are broadcasting live this our annual co-op show\nQuite amazing numbers as well from the river valley car share those\nOh sure um we are ten years old we have nearly ten thousand a co-op owners here at river valley caught 'em about Seventeen hundred of them are in uh East Hampton area which is where we're going to open our second store\nUm in in ten years we've grown from zero annual sales to a a little over twenty eight million in annual sales and we had expected that we might do Thirteen million by our tenth year when we were opening ten years ago\nThat's a lot of money\n[laughter] it's it's been really it's been a lot of sales that's a lot of local

white wide smile will have your friends talking about how you look ... risk free\nGrowing at every paycheck and I have some days and collections that negatively affected my score\nAnd I'm just wondering you know well it helped my score to pay them off and and take that on my savings they pay the\nCollections and debt off or am I better keep getting that cash on hand for my down payment on my house I've read on line that even if you pay off things that are already in collections that has a zero impact on your credit score\nSo if you have a collection on your report that is the main factor and what happens with your credit so if you pay off\nIn old item ... will raise your score potentially some but it depends on the scoring model being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the new a spike model\nGives you a good bump into your credit score if you take an active collection and\nSatellite pay it and it's now report is a zero balance but the lender has to be using the newest model of the psycho scoring which just completely depends on the credit grander\nYeah so it's not whether one of the three credit bureaus are usually the latest model it's based on the credit union and what they're even\nExactly so as an example the one that takes into account how you handled past what excuse the term what they would call bad behavior and you've turned it or you've turned it around and you've taken care of something the model known as fight go nine\nIs the one that the credit union would have to be using as I understand that for there to be a meaningful impact on your score paying off and old item\nI mean generally wants an old item hit seven years it vanishes anyway\nMy follow up on that is a one of the items and collections of um twenty eleven but it looks like when on my credit report and now shows twenty Fifteen like maybe there was some way to the gate got refreshed or is that\nThat is the term that I use for it and that is an illegal activity on the part of whoever is reporting that debt unless you took some kind of action on it and twenty Fifteen so what you do is to challenge the date was known as the date of last activity for it\nGot it and generally they don't want to fight with somebody who knows that's how the rules work that's how the law works\nSo you would challenge that item not being on your report but the date that that item is on your report because the aging of it is so important and you contact both whoever the collection agency is reporting it as twenty Fifteen and said a ... eleven you challenge with them and the credit bureau\nGot it okay so\n... how many items from there that are these old items and collection\nThat depends on which bureau I have as little as two one zero and as many as four and another one\nIn or they generally in the age back like early this decade or some of the more recent\nThe most recent one I Would say is four to five years ago\nOkay so that one's got a little clock time to run but the thing is is that the whole idea of credit scoring is that you're not in a credit purgatory forever\nThe ones that period of time passes even if you don't pay on the debt they disappear and you have a fresh start\nSo you're getting out of this or that but settling the ones in particular that are more recent would be to your advantage if you're trying to get credit right now\nExactly so the first thing for me and just to talk to the credit union and just ask them if they're using the\nNine and the person you talked to a loan officer that will know if it's somebody at the credit union they're not going to know and you ask them how do they make a determination on making alone in the event that you have zero balances on these old items will match\nOr is it a website you may have heard me mentioned from time to time credits sesame dot com go read their briefing on what happens with collection items and the different scenarios that apply\nJim joins us on the Clark Howard shown Jim you have an idea you want to share with your fellow listener about emergency savings fun is that true\nThat's true so Clarke I er I already max out my retirement or a threw rocks and a four one K. and I've got a [noise] money sitting in the emergency thunk obviously for an emergency [noise]\nBut uh it's a pretty good chunk of money and I was toying with the idea of taking maybe I don't know half of it and putting it into a target retirement fund that either recently passed\nKnowing that the you know that they're trying to keep someone who is retired or about to retired or try to keep their money\nYou know food from going down obviously I Know there's no guarantee that I was wondering what your thoughts were doing something like that in order to maybe for a little bit of money on that\nI think that that is a very low risk strategy to try to do so return on your rainy day money right and so going into a post retiree portfolio which is what you're doing I think that's a very viable strategy\nObviously a someone who's already in retirement they've they've moved more towards bondsmen stocks I notice the interest rates go up bond won't be looking so hot that\nIs true but you know the whole idea about how they do one of those portfolios is where I mean you could even go into a balance fun that's fifty percent stocks fifty percent fixed income or bonds and the ideas that the risk counteract each other you'd have to have a perfect storm\nFor you to lose a substantial amount of money with either scenario\nAnd even though you're a hundred percent correct his interest rates rise the value of bonds will go down\nIf you're concerned about that you could build your own portfolio using and a short or ultra short bond fund\nAnd using a lower risk stock portfolio stock fund portfolio and eliminate a lot of the bond interest rate risk\nBut the idea of somebody who's a Mac saver like U. of taking a lot of your rainy day money and investing it at a low risk kind of point of the scale I think is great\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chris how can I serve you today\nWell I'll tell you what Thirty years I've been thinking about lasik surgery surgery and I keep upgrading my glasses every year year and a half and got the point now where I got a lawyer invasion [laughter] so\nI cannot lazy and I've seen so many price ranges are somehow a dollar and then there's some ... ... ... dollars and I just want to know why they go\nSo this is this is a tough one because this is where the wallet meets medicine and science\nSo there are high volume chains they're used to be a lot more through the shakeout phase with lasik but there are the volume chains that charge like two fifty three hundred three fifty and I\nYeah and then there

parent I went to somewhere else who is apparently a sister store\nAnd they coordinate buy one get one free at just under five hundred so\nIt kind of a big concern in terms of cost and making sure I'm I'm doing my due diligence there but also I've in the meantime gotten effect from somewhere else where the thirty days guarantee the place that I got my inspection down at and I'm seeing squares this trap was always in circles ... pretty psychedelic and I'm concerned also now\nIs it possible that my prescription is wrong\nWith that could happen I mean that does happen but that's rare I acknowledge eat that optometrist an ophthalmologist use is so accurate for doing prescriptions that it it would be very unlikely\nThat someone has made a mistake and usually the prescriptions are computer generated instead of hand written now which eliminates human error writing down the wrong thing\nIf you have reason to believe that something's not right so you have you did get a pair of glasses and that's what doesn't seem right\nCorrect go back to where the eye exam was done and have them check the prescription of the prescriptions right then you want them to run you through the paces one more time and maybe the prescriptions wrong you know what I make\nSure that will be far as getting glasses more affordably\nYou believe it or not can get glasses over the Internet prescription frames and

congratulations\nAnd believing this jogging one week and I hope to put an awful lot of the house today so I kind of being a transitional period where I Do have a job\nTrying to go to Wendy process that the lenders are probably like a a give me a lot of that situation would it be wise to tap into your contributions to a Roth IRA when my wife and my my own ... in order to fund the health\nSo you have enough money saved and Ross that you could just write a check from your Ross and own your home mortgage free\nIt would probably be a combination of that and say they are like ... and other accounts today would be a close\nEye that's extraordinary but I'd like to talk you away from that because once the money is out of the raw even though you can pull all your contributions tax penalty free the money's not there to continue to grow tax free you can't replenish it that quickly how old are you and your wife\nThirty seven\nWhat you could replenish a lot of money in the next Thirty years so that's not completely true and I said but the advantage of you having a mortgage is interest rates are so favorable right now\nAnd the money and the Roth is likely doubt earn it if you have a diversified across um stock type investments share so on the mortgage thing you are still at your current job correct for one more week\nYou would want to get pre qualified for alone now is your wife working outside the home\nShe is not well okay so it's kind of rely completely on your income yes you have how many years history at your existing job\nI have two years of my current job\nThey and before that how long did you have your prior job\nAh probably about six years\nOkay don't sound like a loan officer sorry [laughter]\nSo\nYou have the work history you will have a work present at your new job\nI Would think would I Would do is I Would call a mortgage broker now and talk to him or her about what's going to be involved in you qualifying for a loan lending standards have become more favorable to borrow worse this year\nAnd I think with the history the fact that you are so much money saved do you know as your credit score solid\nYet it is very good I think you can do alone and I want you to do alone instead of eating up your raw money\nOkay that sounds great\nI mean you using the Roth as a way to pay cash for a home would work if there was like a screaming deal on a home for whatever circumstances you ... can't qualify for a mortgage then you do something that is not unusual way of paying for it but you're circumstance doesn't fit that\nSteven's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Stephen\nHi you've got some issues with debt you want to run by me here do let me hear\nThe last twenty nine thousand dollars a credit card debt now which uh we're working on trying to create a plan to get a job\nWell I'm Glad for that how many years did it take you to get to the twenty nine thousand\nA little less than three\nThat's quick was there a period of unemployment or medical issues mixed in there\nAre a little bit of a life we had a child [noise] almost two years ago and the medical bills from that but also this the shows that are staying at home and I was working a job and author or so\nFor a while [noise] um I'm working one job now mostly with overtime to shut up and now she just getting back to work now she's going to go back part time [noise] um let's see if we can make amends with that and try to make a clamp down\nWhile I got to plan for you the money that she's going to make a net of whatever childcare expenses you have the entire rest of the mountain goes towards the credit card debt\n[noise] I mean that is that is the simple is back of the envelope way because then it's not trying to figure okay so we should send but so much money here and so much money there\nAnd I'm a big fan of doing a ladder where you pay the minimum ... towards the lowest interest rate credit card debt you have and what's the highest do you have one of those like screaming highlight Mount Everest twenty five percent\nNo luckily no we do have some of the store cause that we try to you and then pay right off the with a card [noise]\nUm but it um twelve nine twelve nine\nNine oh that's great so you're not paying back breaking interest so that means of your payments an enormous amount of your payment will go towards principle yes that's great what's the lowest rate you have on a cart\nUm you know I think it's around nine [laughter]\nOkay so uh pretty close spread in that case without a big gap in the interest rate from highest the lowest\nYou could do something that a lot of people find psychologically rewarding and instead pay minimum against all your cards except the one that has the lowest balance\nAnd white that went out because you don't have that much interest rate swing from one to another psychologically for a lot of people it feels better\nWhen you were able to get rid of a card how many cards total do you have\nOne\n[laughter] oh you only have four in total or she has one in\nFive so whatever the lowest balance on one of ms put your big efforts from her new paychecks into that says that's paid off go to the one with the next lowest balance and\nThat way you feel like you're really making progress is the balance comes down what's so neat when the overall balance comes down each check that she gets has so much more impact has a ... percent of the overall remaining balance\nNow another strategy you can do is the thing I talk about paying down your debt thirty months were your goal would be in this case you pay a roughly a thousand dollars a month for thirty months and end up completely credit card\nDebt free [noise] because people can see their way to uh thirty month go you start looking sixteen months it gets a lot harder [noise]\nI don't know if she's going to earn the kind of money if the job she's taking that she net out enough money for you to throw a thousand cards\nYeah I'm not I don't think so are you at a certain is gonna be she's going to gain from\nIowa so the the net amount to take the net amount and just keep attacking it and I promise as you see the balances come down and you feel so much better\nAnd you have so much more sense of control so the amount you owe is a burden but not a backbreaking one\nSo I I Wish you the best way that I Love it if next spring you call me back and let's do a checkup and see what kind of progress you've made with the credit card balances any suggestions I might have at that time Joel joins us Jill you need some advice for your mom is that right\nYes I actually just wondering whether to buy a car and fall or ... or something you know up there in age [laughter]\nHow old is your mom\nEighty one eighty one okay so she is she's a typical eighty plus driver she's\nDriving or somewhere around twenty five hundred to five thousand miles a year\nWith the natural that would be her so the car she has\nFirst I'd like to know it should it be replaced is there anything wrong with the car she has currently\nNo not really I just had a couple of you know minor fix it but it it it could show that a little bit too\nSo the reason I ask is that if somebody is driving that small amount of miles unless she's just tired out of that car you know she hates it or she's bored by it and she wants to spend the money is better at the very very very low mile or she's driving to just keep driving that\nAh it's a little bit for her that's the problem\nOkay so the question of buying or leasing leasing would not work\nBecause driving a couple of hundred miles a month you end up so far below the mileage cap on at least that the oldest completely on economic the best move for someone in your mom situation is to buy a three year old used car\nOkay because the years take so much\nValue off a car and if she has a brand new car drives it a couple of thousand miles a year at the end the three years even though she hasn't driven a whole lot of value in the vehicles been driven way down so if instead some buys a three or four year old car\nThat already somebody else already took a lot of the value off it doesn't matter if that car has forty fifty\nThousand miles on it because three more years she might not have had a you know close to sixty thousand cars still a baby right does that help\nSaturday morning eleven one on one by one over

booklets\nYou name it we do it ah posters banners\nIf you can think of it that's what we do as well as our newest venture into publishing self publishing print on demand books um lots of exciting stuff going on there the big thing this year thing\nWhich is uh [noise] uh the biggest change for us as as a business that is now thirty five years old or a lot of our founding members and older members are retiring\nAnd thank you for the delicate phrasing of that really appreciate that\nAre are are retiring and those of us who were once a young a collective or not anymore and uh and that's been a real interesting thing to deal with is the way in which we handle the turnover\nAnd out of your hand off owners ownership I mean you are who have been there for a long time are the owners are have been the owners of collective copies of worker owned co-op right now new people come in and presumably they're going to be owners as well as from dilution of the uh ownership interest how does that all worked out\n... interesting question I'm so one of the things that was built into the bylaws of collective copies as a worker owned businesses that are buying is only two hundred and fifty dollars\nThat is what you pay to get a share of collective copies and when you leave collective copies that is what you get back\nAnd so it was a way to build in not selling out if it got to profitable\nAnd or the owners that were there when it was super profitable to cash out in cash in so uh the goal of collective copies that has to be a business that is there for\nThe long term that's rooted in the community which I think is a pretty big value of cooperative\nAnd um [noise] so it's a way to ensure that the business days there to be an employee you're in the workplace for the generations to come\nWe're going to take a quick break in our show here live from the river valley caught up in North Hampton this is our annual co-op show when we come back we're going to be speaking

owners things slightly younger than you see is okay so Jill how\nDoes it work for someone answering collective copies as a new member of the collective\nRight well I collect these copies interviewed a number of candidates for their apprentice positions The Apprentice is that the job title that I have I'm an apprentice printer\nAnd I'm apprentice to each his my a fellow worker owners are there are currently co ah sorry eight co owners and I work with each of them they each have different working styles different strengths that they bring to the cooperative\nHold that such a cooperative just the way to put they all have their different strength all of\nThose supervisors or sure the princes apprentice what what is it what do they call it the people you were practicing\nFor uh they are worker owners just were grown okay mhm or printers also printers and members\nOkay so you're a practicing their door on the job how long does that position continue\nFor the apprenticeship last for up to six months or it can be a shorter generation that generally around six months at which time the\nIf The Apprentice would like to be considered for a ownership than the entire cooperative holds a meeting discusses whether they would like to vote in that apprentice to become a co owner and the\nVote has to be unanimous I Believe from the bylaws wow how many people\nDo lifted go ... there are a lot of people they're talking about you or oh my goodness\nYes [laughter] I don't get\nTo witness all of that I don't think but\nProcess let me go back to Randy a ... for a second this process actually works cooperatively this sounds to me like it's a kind of in the ministry of a difficult ... mystery to be difficult thing to do but you saying yes it works\nIt has to work because if it doesn't if\nWe're hiring somebody who's going to be an owner of the business with us\nAnd so\nWhat we're basically doing is every one of us is voting to hire this person as our business partner and so\nIf one person is not driving with this person than it\nReally can't work how many worker worker owners are there a collective copies there were eight right now worker owners or to apprentices who are\nOn track and it's a very pretty brutal process to have to uh to to to go through and you have to have some thick skin and be able to take some criticism and and be\nAble to adapt to a work environment that really requires\nCommunication between people and being able to work together well to make it work and it does collective copies is now how old\nThirty five years old [noise] let me turn now if I might to warn face you Warren is an owner of our family farms great to see you again our annual pilgrimage here to the river valley co-op our family farms what's new with our family farms in the past year\nMy

[noise] we continue our annual co op show\nBroadcasting live from the river valley co up here in North Hampton during the break we had continued our\nConversation and this was a conversation about dollars money and numbers of Lyndon Andrew from car power you were the president\nExplain a little bit more about that to our listeners but he's not sure we made that totally clear of the first go around how does it work how the numbers out of the money work how does the money work in a cooperative and that was the money work for your co op in terms of the goals you ...\n... well I think I think for many of us but we're just talking about is that we're able to offer\nGood quality financial value to our customers to our members\nUm by collaborating with each other doing group buying so we were able to access better pricing I'm as Robin was talking about by buying together the food collapse are able to\nUm function as one larger store because they they combine their purchasing power collect power was able to raise that ten million dollars for um financing nonprofit solar and community solar projects by partnering together with other energy cooperative around the country so there's a by by\nWorking together we're able to access some of the scale that you need in order to get better pricing for your customers\nSo say a person wants to become a member of car power and or wants to put solar on the house but doesn't have the financial resources to do that what does that person do\nUm well we we offer a while\nIn and look at their homes look at their energy use and decide and figure out how to get off of fossil fuels in and save money in the process so\nUm we're able to uh we work with a whole group of installers and energy efficiency contractors on in order to bring down the prices on so that customers can access\nBetter pricing and get really good value\nSo let me turn if I might from ... from ... power she's the president there too Andy to mention who is worker owner PV squared PT squared is part of this explain how a ... explain how TV square works with other cops in power costs to provide these kinds of resources in the community\nOh sure yeah I'm ... so we are a member of a national purchasing coughs where work her own business um meaning you know you consumer coughs producer cops purchasing often work off some were owned by the workers democratically governed by workers\nBut we're a member of other groups that were a member of a national ... called the advocates cooperative\nThis was a cop started by a company called ... solar in Colorado or work off\nAnd it's a person go up of local ... so we are at a scale where we do our purchasing through this amateurs cooperative um we're we're buying for manufacturers at the level of a lot of the big national international solar company so we get the same pricing\nUh we also use that go up as a\nBest practices and information sharing tool so we've done some organizing we've organized as power in Puerto Rico project to provide power in the wake of Hurricane Maria are and we also do\n... and you're you put solar power panels in Puerto Rico how does that work\nYeah there's a number of a portable power stations TPS was the term so it's a trailer essentially with panels batteries a water purifier lockers where you can charge like there's not a permanent solution that sort of a disaster relief solution that's portable or when it's not needed there it can move somewhere else as well\nThat I interrupted you were saying more about the cooperative purchasing power of your co op with other cops to provide the same kinds of well who pricing is the big the big companies\nYeah so I mean that's equipment first thing we ... we also use this call up as a information resource sharing so there's a lot of discussion of you know best practices with a ... type of technical question or how to create new business models a lot of information shared between the different crops that are part of this larger person cough\nYou mentioned the big companies do they present an ongoing threat to local co ops smaller clubs like yours\nI think we're fortunate to be in Massachusetts one of the best states for solar in the country so it it it's very easy to save money here it's also very easy for business by the time to come in and set up and and try and do things here\nI think they're working with someone local uh represents a really different value to people here people care about it and it also just make financial sense because you're buying into a a long term\nBasically power generation plan and you want to work with someone that you trust who's going to be here in five years even if the market changes um so that said yeah I mean there's there's a lot of people or do you want to talk so somewhat about solar you talked a lot of different companies are certainly competition\nBut the local companies use they provide a service that these big companies the big chain companies which will happily sell you a some kind of solar panels and a contract out of the big box stores they can't you off or something they don't\nYeah I mean first of all we're based here so everyone who work with these are the people we see here in the grocery store river valley or frankly when you go up\nOr we want to be able to look him in the eye and and not Dr heads right so we try and get it right the first time we make a mistake we fix it you're not talking to a a call center out of state when you have a problem you're talking to someone who lives in the same town as you\nAre in any case the same neighborhood has me\nYes [laughter] nice to have to get the solar Monday and come [laughter]\n[laughter] during the house I [laughter]\nA a creative solutions that the problem with ... lack of so are we going to move his house so let me turn if I might to Robin O'Brian from the putting the food co-op where she is the general manager\nBecause during the break we were talking about numbers Robin you mentioned I think a quite amazing number involving the button a food co-op share that with our listeners if you would please\nSo we have Seventeen hundred members um and we live in a town of about twenty six hundred people so that's um I think probably one of the highest proportions of owner ... member owners to a population that caught can claim\nAnd why does did or does that happen why does that how why\nWell in our town ... ... is the only grocery store and\nUh my good my goodness these cops has been out for you [laughter] [laughter]\nUm\nAnd we truly are a hub we represent our community and and a lot of ways and we're very much involved um in ways of helping people close that gap on food access we are involved with the food shelf we um help out with that the school food pantry and a few other things\nWhile on the in the world of extraordinary number as I'd like to turn to show a printing who is the general manager of the river valley co-op where we are broadcasting live this our annual co-op show quite amazing numbers as well from the river valley car share those\nOh sure um we are ten years old we have nearly ten thousand a co-op owners here at river valley caught 'em about Seventeen hundred of them are in the East Hampton area which is where we're going to open our second store\nUm in in ten years they've grown from zero annual sales to a a little over twenty eight million in annual sales and we had expected that we might do Thirteen million by our tenth here when we were opening ten years ago\nThat's a lot of money\n[laughter] it's it's been really it's\nBeen a lot of sales that's a lot of local farmers selling them around here yeah\nIt's a over six million dollars that we purchase a locally from local farmers in local food producers um and and that that number has remained\nAnd about a third of our total purchases pretty much since the second year we open so as a store has grown", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city":
