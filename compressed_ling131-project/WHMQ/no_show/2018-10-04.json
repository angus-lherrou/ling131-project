that's not going to happen it seems to me that if every you're going to get to a global zero he'll be because everybody realizes they can't outspend the United states\nI don't understand the logic of our unilaterally reducing our arsenal to the point where it may not be usable and essentially having everybody else say yeah we'll we'll we'll do the same thing they're recommending three hundred warheads go ahead Peter\nWell let's go back to twenty twelve and they issued a report very like this ah this was last report it called for\nA thousand warhead in the United states arsenal and now they're under three hundred so they reduced it by Seventy five percent\nThey said at that time in twenty twelve Russia was not a threat\nAnd they did a survey of people who are members of the council on Foreign Relations and said in twenty twelve is Russia threat and the number of them said no and therefore they concluded Russia was not a threat that day they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued a ...\nA threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense sites and as my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve\nThe Russian military or civilian including Mr coot and hence you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons these are not been implicit these men explicit threat so what they basically done in this twenty eight team report is instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty warheads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey take around to sixty we'd have to submarines that see that would be it the other three would be a import\nAnd when you look at what the ... are we probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads what would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land based missiles bombers and submarines\nSpread all over the country we would be down to five to ... seat to set up bases ... bomber base bombers would not be usable\nOr the warheads would be put elsewhere\nAnd then they have this crazy idea that warheads and missiles would be separated\nAnd where would we store these hundreds of warheads while they're empty silos and that used to be minute man silos\nWhich general Cartwright the negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put her book bull's eye on it\nPainted bright red so the Chinese and could no but they just took out all our work as we didn't matter whether we had some rain bombers are ICBMs left which we wouldn't uh we wouldn't have any warheads\nSo in their twenties twelve report they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrian at the north Koreans and Iran have targets equally in about a thousand that we could rationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taking out\nThose numbers have all of a sudden crashed to less than a couple of hundred and what they've decided to do is no military targets would be\nIn any country no conventional military targets would be hit interests hello Troy strike we'd hit their banking their communications and there are cities\nAnd that would be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because cities banking communications don't move they're all sitting there so we would take at least\nNo less than Seventy two hours to respond if we wanted to and if we put warheads out in the minimum silos Montana um give you an example for a minute man base to put warheads back on missiles you can do three missiles per month or wing and their three wings\nShould do nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of\nA good player on global zero wants to eliminate all minute man so we would go down from well over five hundred targets to as I said five feet artist with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender work is a unilateral surrender includes the fall I Want to know how I can joined the international monitoring program\nI Hope they have really cool uniforms because well because their job will be exhausting to guarantee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting that the ... and this hundred and seven page report\nOver there they they don't talk about verification because you can't verify for example will be alert and that's your favorite thing it's like turning off a missile well with a keystroke on the computer I can turn it back on\nAnd I could targeted wherever I Want a targeted nobody will know so there's no verification of course but then they say and this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to now not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarines safe and this is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote\nSo sincerely vows is like a marriage wedding sincerely vow to you know on her and uh be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we we now have marriage in a nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it's if they sincerely vowed to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the book or this hundred and seven page book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nWill have it somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force and we'll have about\nTwenty percent of our current force that is allowed under a treaty for getting rid of everything now one of the things is really strange is\nAll the submarines have all the new some regional sixteen missiles\nEvery missile Bruce Blair says put eight warheads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians bust out of the global other new start treaty or the Chinese build up we will have no buildup capability which Bill Clinton George Bush and Barack Obama all hold the hedge\nAnd we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable warhead to see\n'em that would be it and the other guys to build what ever they wanted to bill\nGarden you have about a minute So Peter I'm you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening to your sense of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run them through how global zero would do with pollutants stretch to use nukes to start a war do they have a plan Peter a thirty second\nNo no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a D. five submarine missile it gets there quickly within Neal twenty to thirty minutes which we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not a question low yield weapons this question can you get them to the battle\nA potent by the way announced this new strategy in April to sound\nIn two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen announced everything's going to be built done deployed in the field by twenty Twenty one\nAnd this I'm quoting are strapped commander General John heightened so potent started doing that that can twenty two thousand in April and

reports of the internment of up to one million weaker Muslims and ... is that a political controversy in Pakistan is there a is there a push at Beijing to stop it\n[noise] you know that's an issue that hasn't received much press coverage in Pakistan or Fox has a fairly independent press but there are red lines on the issues that um the free press is not allowed to cover and I my sense is that there's been some you know\nA indication or some um you know direction not to cover this issue so I Would say most people in bucks on are largely unaware of what's happening there\nUm but uh in in certain circles you know many Pakistanis or move across the border have a are married to women who live in ... women\nUm are there are some businessmen who traveled there and then people who are who see consumers of of local news so they're well aware of what's going on and I think um you know as long as the situation continues and faster as\nI'm In you know there may be a response especially from a religious circles and even extreme of circles inside Pakistan and so I don't think it's an issue that can be swept under the rug\nAnd especially if you know the if the Chinese and the bucks honeys would like to have this kind of a a economic uh kind of activity and uh the free flow of people and goods across the border\nUm and you know they're spending billions of dollars on on developing the physical connectivity over the land border you know I I just don't see a future in which there can be um you know a great deal of economic activity and the infrastructure can ... you know pay itself back\nOr so there's a human rights angle which is you know it's it's a moral abomination you know and respect what's happening but then there's also the economics of it should John it's supposed to be this outpost connecting I Try not to um to the Eurasian land mass and a and I just don't see that happening\nReally what's happening in terms of Pakistan is that the government has been supporting China with regard to the readers situation\nAnd this is where China's debt trapped diplomacy is called is actually working\nBecause right now in Muslim about you're not going to get a senior government official on the record criticizing the Chinese but of course when you look at the mass of people in any a Muslim majority country\nUm this does not sit well people may not say anything day to day largely because they stealing coerced\nOr because you know sometimes I just don't know about the issue but this just doesn't work when you starting to look at for instance countries like Kazakhstan we're a long time you know the Kazakhstan government didn't say anything about ... and now is really being forced to I think you're going to see the same thing in Pakistan\nThe fact that it isn't in the news is that a tell that they're frightened of it yeah\nYeah definitely because you know if another country was doing that it'll save the United states was doing that to its Muslim population it would certainly be in the news it would be on the cover of newspapers and and in the headlines there so uh I think clearly a there's a you know some sort of\nReason there's an obvious reason why I'm a private median of in the state owned media is a is most likely suppressing this information I it is covered to some degree in the English language

Jim ...\nI'm John ... recording Chang Genovese me go to Hong Kong a colleague Andrew Collier managing director of Korean capital research in Hong Kong he is the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism in China and do a good morning to you I report my conversation with the director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow within these last hours\nThat after the U.S embassy a deal put into place and pending approval by Congress\nThat the emu that includes UK at this moment and Mexico and Canada the U.S MCA along with Japan are looking to speak with one voice to correct or to urge China to correct It's a incorrect trading practices of these last year's violations the WTO\nDoes China anticipating one voice with it from its trading partners at this moment Andrew good morning to\nA good even John I'm no I mean I think ... I was dreaming a there's it's a very unlikely that the European with the United states and Mexico will be on the phone page on this\nEuropeans are desperate for growth and um they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money in China\nSo I expect very little uh agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going well\nThan the number so far I haven't been that that exports were up fairly helpfully and imports were up uh I have the August numbers which are twenty percent which is pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of qualities do province in the south with it which accounts for twenty percent of exports\nAnd they're you're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be seeing the beginnings tiles\nBut so far the economy's been it held holding up surprisingly well\nAnd is that because of trade friction or is it does something other factor\nOh I'm pretty sure that the weakest link wrong don't is because of trade friction or the data's inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses export uh different kinds of cotton goods and others going for the United states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd and one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that\nWell because they basically investors in the west ... assume that a Chinese government that is perfectly cell or because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rates are going to look for overseas capital\nBut why would the Chinese need the money\nWell the the because often or overseas are willing to pay a ... it's expensive capital and domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a get new sources of capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy\nThe puzzle China is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate\nI think the Chinese are more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in a settled\nThere was actually asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do it would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a you've stolen some of our technology ah in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nEither area that we think you should focus on instead the Trump ... the ... and the others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese are think are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing them figure it's a political football\nSo if they wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody advance a timeline just ... spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that um so they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I won't get help if it's a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or having large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you use it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that all people have been predicting hasn't happened\nOr the economy has definitely slowing a but we're not seeing massive defaults we are seeing an increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not massive default\nAnd the leadership is titled script over the riskier banks and the system so so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapse and then you got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bike do ten and um and other ... about the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the risky a fast\nThey now start are starting to open the speak again and they're hoping to fuel growth in small businesses that have a lot of employees to keep employment up unfortunately it looks like a lot of the credits just going to go to the state firms that are the most inefficient\nSo this is really not good for China's long term a structural growth but it's just the way the Chinese system operates\nA we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested the Chinese confidence believes that the country can grow without an accommodation\n[noise] wow there they were not happy about it\nBut she took care of the president is dealing with you know that he's dealing with a attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic off\nAnd he's looking at a Trump Administration that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm going to have to deal with what I can control domestically so um they're kind of stuck and uh there's not much more they can do\nAndrew Collier is the managing director of the Korean capital research he is in Hong Kong this morning where the weather is better and he's the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism

just read tonight that are a great effort is going to name a the perpetrators of cyber attacks I and\nI like minded countries you know when we developed this a cyber deterrence initiative\nIn aggressively go after the perpetrators or you know in in here from an international law coalition perspective uh that's really what's needed to start putting pressure on these bad actors and so now that we have a new strategy I'm looking to see that our government is is is going to implement it\nAnd it looks like we really are are beginning to implement this new strategy and remember\nThat part of that is uh that uh they're taking the gloves off\nA and providing authorities for offensive cyber operations which is really key\nTo have it I don't know the answer to this so forgive me asking a question I didn't I didn't mention before to the north Koreans work with the Russians and the Iranians in cyber theft\n[noise] uh that's not clear but I it it it's certainly a who'd be logical I mean the north Koreans work with the Iranians on a missile technology on nuclear weapons I you know I mean\nYou look at the er the transfer of technology I and so I I'm sure that there is collaboration then of course\nI'm you know I I same probably with the Russians as well\nThink all of these hackers and in these people that operate in the cyber realm\nI think they're ah they're sharing best practices are and they all learn from each other\nAnd so they can you know and of course North Korea does something that's useful others can pick up on that and in North Korea one thing we know about them they are very good at learning or from others and so I have no doubt that they are trying to gain any kind of a skills and information from the Russians from the Iranians from the Chinese\nAnd

decided and reported January of Nineteen Seventy three I remember the date because it does all merges together with the death of Lyndon Baines Johnson\nAnd the end of the Vietnam War conflict as we understood it altogether but roe v Wade is still with us where the others are history books bill a very good evening to you you present the case\nThat the odd assaults on judge Kavanaugh's character\nHave their origin in the doubts about roe v Wade who doubt to build good evening to\nLeaving a well as you know I'm the champions of living constitution the idea that the constitution could be made to say anything we think it should say\nAnd doesn't at any time in our history they have one exception they believe that the law up ending all the state laws and fifty states I'm On abortion that that is a singular president precedent that is fixed and sacred and it's a bad decision even pro choice\nI'm curious recognize how bad it was frankly the Supreme Court recognized how bad it wasn't Planned Parenthood versus Casey when they basically gutted the ruling but kept the outcome so I think what happens is that the the champions of roe no how brittle that laws and they know that\nA serious jurist given us a hard look I'm might find it very vulnerable so whenever they think there's the fifth vote\nThat could affect row they thought that with Robert Bork they thought it with uh Clarence Thomas remember at the time they thought Kennedy might be an anti row focuses before Planned Parenthood versus Casey and\nThey think with Brett Kavanaugh even though it's not clear to me you know how Brecht would vote since he's talked about it as a precedent that's been reaffirmed as the president so but that's still worried about Mrs with Democrats do when we're always at stake for when they grow is at stake they they just go after people um with everything they've got\nYou know that I've done in science and who the guy begins this present unhappiness with her revelations in

Am keen on is yours\nIt's about how this matter these last days will affect the voting in the Senate primaries are in the Senate or a credit midterms especially in states plus take to for example Texas where Senator Cruz is in a very strong red tape but being challenged by a congressman Beto O'Rourke\nAnd in Missouri where a sitting Senator McCaskill is being challenged also by are a very fresh Republican face and I'll throw in Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota as well\nOr good evening to you both so we begin with you and Texas do you see this affecting the cruise vote of the proof turnout for Oregon good evening to\nGood evening thanks so much for having me on so I think one of the most fascinating things is how completely different uh the the the prospects are for the Republicans in just one week\nSo last week I Would have told you that the Senate was essentially going to be a wash and at the end of the day that ... the Republicans would probably have a a small majority in the Senate as ... as they do right now uh this this completely changed within a week\nUm I think that uh the the Kavanaugh situation has changed things dramatically in terms of the ... for the Republican energized\nA the coalition for new Oculus coalition that rot they tend to have their um for Trump\nOr this is not that I often remind people\nThey they ... this this coalition was already building Trump was not the causes that he was the result of it but they were not they didn't want anything to coalesce around\nUh in in ... in his mid ... they do now and it's not around Trump which I think is a very important things than they are coming together and they are energized\nOver what they believe is and I I like the tale this in the great revolt this um that that culture meaning the big political parties the big political system along with the media and along with pop culture\nPopular culture um are sort of against them and don't understand them and with 'em and and that is the case with Kavanaugh they believe that has been heavy handed against him and they projected that on his and sell\nDrugs I mean turnout your models are are are going to change for foreign against you see this exciting turnout in Texas or Missouri in North Dakota as well for both sides Selena\nWell ... we're ... the Democrats are already or just to show a rover already AT T\nRight well we were looking to see was is there this\nPopulist coalition was going to do it to be energized to come out I'm at a forward the nit turns ... this has done it um you know now a independents are always sort of\nWhere we are not sure where they are but you're both parties are at equal levels and because so many Democrats that are up for reelection in red states that puts them at the disadvantage\nSo not only will um is Texas\nEntered your a right for Republican either hold and or pick up but I've seen movement in Florida\nAnd Indiana and uh I I I think North Dakota is gone and and I'll keep an eye on Monday and so ... this is a\nBig game changing moment I mean I I you know I feel bad for what they have in our family has gone through but it has been the best thing for the Republicans a ... in the ... in the final weeks of the ...\nLaura good evening few political science here I Am I'm On aware helped me teach me is there a political science version of what we've spoken about both the house these last year's mug that are following a close election the advantages to the party out of power does that work in the Senate as well Laura good evening she\nEvening John thanks for having me on yes\nIt does work but not as consistently so what we do see is that oftentimes the party out of power does pick up seats in the Senate\nBut as I said it's not as consistent and there are times when in fact the president's party does do better and much of that has to do\nWith some of what we're dealing with this time around and that is\nThe class of senators who are up and which party\nIs sort of more on the defensive to begin with as we know in this election the Democrats are incumbents and a number of states that the Republicans won handily\nIn twenty sixteen and so they're already was a sort of Senate lean toward the Republicans wave elections all\nSeats both in the house and Senate tend to fall in one direction and that's where you saw what Selena was just talking about that\nYou know a few weeks ago people were saying well you know maybe the Senate could in fact um do a little bit better than the Democrats than people are thinking maybe Beto O'Rourke is really in a good place um because those sort of wave numbers were starting to be their\nSalinas absolutely right that the Kavanaugh hearings have energize the Republican base but the one I'm cautionary note I Would say is that I'm not certain that in our world today that energy and enthusiasm will stay there\nFor another five weeks in other words it is very possible to me\nThat um Kavanaugh\nEnds up getting confirmed at the end of this week and that by next week you see Republicans um and the enthusiasm that they have this week\nSomewhat more complacent about well we got it it's done the war spending one and you start to then see the Democrats even more upset and enraged\nBy the fact that Kavanaugh's nomination went through so I'm not sure where we're going to be a couple of weeks from now\nI also think it's important to realize that when we do look at the polling um there is essentially a reality that\nMore independence both men and women are believe a Dr Ford than believe a judge Kavanaugh\nIt is also true that um that when you look at just women independence um the belief around Ford's testimony over Kavanaugh's was fifty six percent to twenty four percent so\nYou know there is going to be a very interesting shakeout of who are we talking about as the swing voters because white\nI'm In college educated um Republicans may not stay with I'm sort of the Republicans and Kavanaugh and they may in fact I'm uphold more of Ford's testimony\nA detail here we just have a a thirty seconds or so for both of you or how it is a is a is that a trajectory to go to the Democrats and the next week does the term all going to affect that Leno just about Fifteen seconds you see the turmoil\nUh also bumping the house or is that on a glide path to laugh\nI still think I see a Republican or Democrat gaining at least Seventeen at this moment um all the way up to thirty sign I think at the end of the day was and whether or not but either side in the majority\nLara or do you have the turmoil here that you just noted you know next week will be a new new scandal is the how is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington says the ... the ... is a cake bake I think that's what I like best or is it still in play\nI don't know that the cake is yet baked but I Do believe that just as Selina was saying this cat on hearing I'm kind of woke up a lot of President Trump's base especially those um blue collar workers I think it is also true that ...\nIt has we distanced more college educated suburban women and that will matter in the house races\nLara Brown and George Washington university Salinas each of the Washington Examiner I'm John bachelor this is talk about social\nGoing age\n[noise] kind of wild denies overnight low fifty

five and one of seven size WHM [noise]\nBut the difference is and the old regime if you\nHad an agency with a bad argument then somebody found the student or have you with a good argument you could follow the good argument now on the ... you have to follow the bad argument even if you think it's wrong and so you see case after case doing this and Gorsuch and cabinet\nThat started essentially what the following very simple proposition as a constitutional matter let alone statutory matter\nYou're looking at the situation and you know courts is supposed to decide questions of wall and executive branches are not supposed to do that and so we think that this offends the basic principle of separation of powers\nThe point is sufficiently strong that even if they decided to change the text of the administrative procedure act which has been constant since Nineteen forty six they would say you could not do it so the stakes are very high on this particular question and I think that the\nGorsuch cabinet position is correct about long held that particular view but it used to be a voice crying in the wilderness and now it turns out that we're getting closer to the point where this doctrine may be toppled\nWritten Richard I want I Want to use an example here and see if I understand that I'll let you clean Air Act which allowed the EPA to interpret the law claiming this was ambiguous and therefore here's our ruling you say that it permitted the EPA did say that if you have a piece of equipment and you want to upgrade it\nThat it permitted if the amount of pollution doesn't change that's what that's what the ruling it in this in some however\nThe question is what's a piece of equipment rice and you know there's a bit of a philosophical puzzle here it's this half the heat the heat is a part of a piece of equipment a piece of equipment\nAnd his factory something you can upgrade without having to ask for new permits and go through the process of the\nDemocratic rule no the moment you decided to shift the amount of emissions from one smokestack to another you have to start over this could be years\nAnd and that is that's partisanship out of the uh the chef ... ... and it would change from administrative ... that's exactly what was feared and it and it happens\nIt happens in this particular case\nAnd my view about it is that the stability of expectations that you want out of law means that you should have judges decide these things and if they're going to build a rule is going to be by an act of Congress or in some cases where the agency may do so that could change the administrative\nRule in one form or another but it is generally understood when you start to change these rules on an ad hoc basis or the retroactive application is suspect\nPolitically there's a lot of resistance and at least before the recent Chevron doctrine\nChevron in context because at the same time that the courts with dealing with Chevron what we did is we had a number of cases involving a question\nOf whether or not when the government made a deal with people you joined this particular pension fund and if you don't think that we're doing things correctly you can pull out without recrimination the argument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can keep their work so when you make your decision you have to assume that these guys may well be acting in bad faith as long as it's the ... are you are bound by the changing decision\nNow the whole principle of the rule of law as we know that government officials can act in bad faith and so the reason we\nProtect ourselves against retroactive\nChanges with massive wells consequences is to make sure that they don't the fact that it's simple that this thing will happen if you let them go is the strongest reasons to saying you will never let them go so this is in the middle of the Reagan Administration and what happens is it turns out that there was a remarkably low threshold\nFor the protection of vested rights they don't protect them at all and this whole situation\nCreates all sorts of uncertainty in the way in which government or to run and the Republicans have been as much to blame for months that this is the defendants\nAnd there's a story for example about ... there's a case called outweigh you we are and what it did is involved the question of how we define certain kinds of police officers and or the department of labor under Clinton came up with the obviously absurd position that date a sergeant\nOr a lieutenant was not and they ended ministry eater and executive or a professional\nUnder the fair labor standards act and therefore is titled the overtime and you just go spend three minutes looking at the definition of their duties and of course they're all over the patrol that at one level and the other and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion which says well you know this is the way things on the big city it looks to me like it's perfectly fence while I'm not going to\nStrike down they know more about this subject than I Do\nThis was of course a straight political move by

digress we we're going to segue from her last week's show on ...\nJust into one of the main components to suck attached which is being is because it is the season for what's known as showed means show which are what are the beans that go into soccer cash so in ... at this time of year is a time when as we talked last week when you can get show beans\nFresh and they're much quicker to cook and they're and they're not really tasty are but they're definitely quicker to cook and they are just different they they don't require the soaking in all the fuss ... not a fuss but it's pre planning\nThat dried beans require and we're moving into the wintertime when beans are so valuable because do you know the beans have the highest protein content of any plant matter really yeah I'll be I mean you're you're talking about this kind of means we're talking about ... in Wyoming\nAs long as you're that that kind of nice player Lima bean to me by the way we used to have a lot of it as kids my mother made a lot a lot of beans right I I found them to be a little bit tricky but I've I've learned how to like them over the years but they looked like this little piece of your your plans for a Paris or something and they do and then they you know turn into a bean\nThat you eat how does that happen well ask the Peruvians they actually were discovered in around in and around the Lima a Caribbean alert right around there or South American beans beans\nBeans are basically worldwide which is what's also interesting that convenes can be from the size of a race screen all the way up to the size of a quail egg there actually was called ... got into in Italy and they are they're they're in the ... family wow but they're humongous\nAnd they and what's interesting also about beans is the large it isn't isn't scale the way you think like little ones don't cook more quickly than large ones actually is a lot of the larger beans cook more quickly than the little ones\nAnd all has to do with just the chemical composition and the density so that's why we soak them generally in the wintertime now if you if you are a bean eater and you really love beans and you can be around you probably learned that\nIn the summertime if you do that ... was it soaking you often you'll ... you'll get a little bit of bubbling on the surface of the soaking water and they'll they'll taste a little funny and they'll actually give you a lot more ...\nOh yes and God Knows we\nDon't have enough of that in our life [laughter] but for those I don't talk about a presidential alert right so\nOne of the things about this great about beans is we don't tend to eat as many of them in the summertime so this isn't as big of a problem in in the cold weather when you come overnight usually do it in a in an ambient or a cool room and so it doesn't occur as much\nAnd the patient but if you if you're if you're doing it in a warm environment then you can always soak beans in the refrigerator that will prevent this from happening also the longer you soak them the more apt to already have the fermentation and then once it starts there's really no way to get get rid of it you you would think that you could just rinse that off\nAnd then so come a little bit or maybe boil and then we'll go way well it turns out doesn't it actually goes into the picture of the beans so it's\nIt's in there for that whole batch she which is a which is you know the way [laughter] but uh that's one of the things that's avoided\nThis time of year because if you're if you're eating them before they been dry also the other thing is a lot of the beans that you buy the supermarket not to be smart to our friends in the supermarkets but just because of the way that the\nFlow happens in food source thing in this country\nA lot of the beans that we buy in the in the in the big stores can be two three years old the older the bean the laundry needed soak it in the morning they are to do that fermentation and just be tough in general so if you can try to buy beans that are from a\nCompany that is more in the premium end of the spectrum and their beans or from the previous year at the leading or at the longest trip and we want to look at it\nAnd you go you can you get those gigantic beans you talked about can you get them around here you can\nBut I don't know where ... probably places like provisions or maybe ... or it would be a seasonal items they probably already and yet because they're\nBecause they're big they take longer to grow so they wouldn't have been harvested yeah so it will be more around Christmas Time we used to sell them they would come in\nSometimes just in time for the holidays but more likely January something like they make a good ornament there are great New Year's food because there who looked like a coin so there are some of the shifts in Italy so people use them because they look like the larger in the old days the larger lira\nAs opposed to you and

...\nI didn't know that and then there was another uh Boston team that had a had beans and it's a moniker yeah yeah I'm I'm worried about the Yankees Red Sox right yeah I think the red Sox are in for a battle\nOr do you think so too and of course everybody's clamoring for the match up they lie they don't want to match up\nThen with the trumps the other team match of the restaurant we just want to win it looked like it can be of Baltimore instead [laughter] and looking ahead of everybody wants Yankees Dodgers of course of course for everybody\nYou know yeah yeah except for me to review and yeah

I'm\nGoing to focus on that word here but before we get too hung up on that let me turn to Jonathan cause what playwright actor numerous from North Hampton so your play life in the Fort won three is about what\nWell one of the great things about this region is we have a lot of then use that people can use for the various events various groups and organizations can bring their their thing to do this then you were that venue\nAnd now I'm not saying that this would ever happen in our region or that this has ever happened in our region but imagine what if there were a scheduling mix up as far\nAs who's using you mean someone doesn't come to the radio talk show at the time where we were expecting that [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] and uh\nSo so yes you suppose there was a little bit of confusion as to who's using a particular venue at a particular time and particularly what would be the Foley soundscape of such a situation\nWhere we find out what would be the landscape of such a situation any thoughts [noise] well I\nHaven't read this play I Know that there is a Frank and I are going to be very busy Frank ... who was my other co Foley artists there's a lot of overlap there's a lot of oh I see you've\nGot different sounds going on at the same time\nYes apps discordant in some well and some of the play rights now I think people now know that that part of the fun is the sound and so I'm reading some of these thinking they are trying to challenge the guard the how many they can put in into one\nYou know the the the ping pong table with the the D. J. rap and uh you know the ... you know it's all\nHappening at the same time and\nQuick detour Sam rush Foley artist is what\nWell if only artist or provides the live kind of sound effects you know in film it's all of that you know when there's that fight these but the artists that are actually slamming sides of beef or breaking cucumbers are salary to sound like crunching bones or you know that kind of thing but\nI Believe and I don't know really know but maybe want to be like is it that there was an individual whose name was fully thanks so but I'm not a hundred percent sure I think it was that was that's based on that one of the first guys who did sort of sound effects and Jack Foley Jack Foley uh yes so there we go\nAll the time radio person I take it we know that Monti\nNeighborhood I guess your film maybe no ... radio Jack Foley April twelve to Eighteen\nNinety One to November ninth Nineteen sixty seven to develop or many sound effect techniques using filmmaking\nAh okay yeah good research thank you so let me tell you the Internet so let me let me turn back\nTo the player ice storms and cause a within Ellen what lingered who are your actors in all this and where\nDid they come from and it's just I haven't met the actress who hail in my play were made on Saturday the first time and uh they'll run through it and see who they are but I'm interested\nTo meet some new local actors and Jonathan cause Ellis same for you and I know some of the people involved and I don't want to get any names wrong\nOkay but I'm I'm really looking forward to it because I you know I've seen these people before and they're great and I can just imagine what what are the job they will do with my script\nLet me turn back to\nSam mushroom moment if I might see in terms of the places you signed a theme or made a request to the play rights\nAnd then they simply not simply but then they wrote for this production is that how it works\nOr works it's that way I Would say mostly like four fifths of that is correct a couple of these I was pretty good for me it's a salad [laughter] not a like al and the case of Allen I invited her to write something for this and uh she felt a little bit of a you know it's like twisted her arm just a little bit and she actually produced a beautiful\nUh a thing Jonathan I think Europe play you a was one that you had written for maybe a previous year\nThat we didn't select and so we decided to do it for this year Stephanie was uh was one that I think was a similar situation that she wrote when we were soliciting poor when three scripts and uh she said hey how about this one and so she brought it and then John ... wrote specifically for this particular piece\nI Wish I Wish I Wish I'd on board and was there saw the need for this thing at and became a fundraiser for the grants for just a son with me\nWe should point out that the greens borough justice fund was founded by Marty nice and using proceeds from\nCourt case civil court case that resulted from the assassination of her her then husband by the Ku Klux Klan\nComplicit with law enforcement so I'd like to turn a bit if I might to the celebrations of service on Sundays self again first churches this Sunday three o'clock three o'clock okay what was the service be\nIt will be friends who will get up and speak for very briefly about what ark he meant to us because I was walking down\nThe street here today realizing that in\nThe ... what I find to be very dark times I really wish I had are key next to me [laughter] she had an unstoppable spirit\nOn optimism and joy in being with people that really pick you up when you were around ... am I right Mary you\nAre right you are re she she's a was a person of incredible energy and ah and courage I\nThink and and that she transmitted to others and ah I think gathered us all in and made us think that we could keep going and not just could but we really must going\nI take that as a service there'll be some talks to music some a uplifting as well\nOh Martin is an all of those things and they're also will be food if you bring it [laughter] and we are having a pot like mom [laughter] so if you could bring some finger foods are our deserts\nPlease do um everybody is invited even if you didn't know I keep because if you didn't know\nLet's talk about her because she's could help us carry through these terrible Trump time\nAnd this is a celebration of community which is exactly what ... would have wanted and would have appreciated I'd like to turn to the river and the rabbi for moments and sisters are reveling in the rabbi segment\nAnd tell you very briefly the story that I heard just a few weekends ago there was a lay minister type a mood presiding over a funeral a funeral over a wedding and\nHe was talking to a member of the ...\nAnd the members asking for some pointers because you've never done a wedding before and the members of course he said look here's the real story at weddings nobody really cares about who you are or what you say or what you do you're just kind of there is a function or is it funerals where people were really appreciate me so\nActually I Do know is better than weddings which sounds terrible but I think it does but has but has has some truth to it I think so I appreciate your perspective what sort of a computer us I think there's truth to it though I see my I think\nThe truth or I wasn't sure he likes you know I don't want to [laughter] I mean not me\nWhy things are often about the clothes that people are wearing and\nAnd just I'm a having a really good time and the meal afterwards and I I think funerals are the most moving events that I go to a here in the city because that is when people really pay tribute to the lives of\nLike ... and are and where they do just what you are doing Mary ah and it's it's so moving and we had one for our key up at the um\nCame forward and talked about our ... and and talking about are you there was so powerful bill I I I I agree there's something about the funerals where people talk about the lives of people in such a meaningful way and talk about the lives of\nPeople who have passed in a way in the ways in which they have affected those who continue to live and that is so moving I think so revealing and I think is absolutely true for archaea because she affected thousands of people in very meaningful very personal ways\nLet me turn to rabbi Justin David your thoughts yeah well first of all boy I think you should make a point to perform advisor [laughter]\nSorry priority [laughter]\nHaving said that I actually I have a different kind of question every after the show [laughter] and I'm\n... this is a question for Peter but for everyone um but I but I Want to start with Peter because um when I think of someone like marquee and someone who is a role model for so many people ... around whom so many people clustered\nI'm from your perspective as a pastor I'm Peter and and someone who led who who led communities and still leads religious communities what does it mean to have\nSome are key or someone like ... in the community what does what does that do for the community and how I Am curious to hear how that one person with extraordinary abilities and generosity and commitment can really shape all the dynamic of a whole group of people well\nWell Mary and and Marty just shut it for me too I I I mean these are hard times where we all I mean what's happening in Washington right now what's happening to our country right now is really hard it's hard for me I I wake up in the night feeling just terrible about America this time\nAnd and so someone like Archie does ... she really loves to shop and I too I think uh Archie I live next to argue when I came to first churches or they had a ... right across the street from our house and Georgia's house\nAnd so she welcomed me to North Hampton and she made me she was the ... when George for the first people to make me feel like I was really part of this community and she does this\nEvery day when we think about\nMarriage Santa Marta nascent final word on the license mark and Mark I'm in the service in celebration of her life that will occur this Sunday at three o'clock at first churches here in North Hampton everyone has invited\nFriends and those who simply want to know more about ... or anyone who simply wants to join in this community celebration of an amazing woman\nWe please join us because I I think it will be uplifting um and I think you will feel energized and you will learn about Iraqi if you don't already know and if you do you will celebrate her and it will be so helpful to you\nLet me turn from ... to more than a nascent Dr Nathan\nI think he tried to change the world I'm In a pretty selfless way um and I think that we all see that the world needs that changing and\nI think that community such as we will have together on Sunday will help us a lot and making the changes we need\nAnd and we should note that uh the ... fund will gladly accept your contributions in honor of our ...\nWe certainly will and archaea would love that\nWhen we come back we're going to need to continue with the river and in

tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all\nSo the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopoly so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling

or ... minutes often\nFor much less\nThan you would pay you if you just gotta gotta gotta be there in addition if you're willing to ... like I Do and the crummy seats\nYou're going to find that you're

customized vaccine in the mail for combat parking space for regular saying I kind of locked in a reward me for South of buying a smaller Carter provide more parking room for other\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for I'm already dollars a month now and that's rising some limited plans are Seventy five to Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month the taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones\nHorizons name as not anywhere to be found around visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not as that is that it's their network and so it's that forty to one gotcha with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent\n... that's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores is the Invisible Man was all they really are invisible there is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service has done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does or restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great pipe price point a fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know junk food so no it's all included a now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month to with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan\nI've is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween a TNT and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other Eighteenth he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it's sixty so in cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competitions great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nGot it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see is saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plants\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone rate plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all on Clark dot com thank you very much\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nPike lurk ... how are you did I talk to you great to have you\nBeen doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um\nHad a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I Am I have favorite children and so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors are all [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing\nSo tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out as\nA ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes or no minimum account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign around the ... zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about finality had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of us in the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there\nSo fidelity coming up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest 'cause obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment that no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks of free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWith that\nSo finality used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they have an extremely low cost series\nOf a target retirement funds and then they have their old when that still has very high cost well not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering so they have become much more aggressive on the front\nAnd so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talked about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with ... and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystems through the two percent cash card\nGood for you explain that a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nYeah they two percent cash back on every every purchase he runs through and I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your fidelity account\nSo that he has managed that kind of a cow or it can be an IRA right or a college savings plans\nExactly yeah\nSo so

product for all the investments exactly nobody asked me about that in a good while it's called like a fidelity safe like what they call it exactly\nIt's called fit say All right let's say at the\nRight so what they do is they provide you know fidelity any of the big investment companies have massive\nData stories centers that they either operator they lease\nAnd so the capacity required to store digital records like um account records insurance policies um you know special documents you want to keep track of like\nYou had a will anything like that if you want to have a digital copy of them the capacity that they make available is teensy tiny you know it doesn't take\nA lot of of um cloud storage at all to do that so it's really smart or fidelity is away particularly to get their own customers\nInterested in having backup copies of records is good for fidelity is good for you and they make it free as I recall not just a fidelity customers but you don't even have to be a customer of fidelity to use it\nI had no idea [noise]\nSo I ... if it's still true that anybody can use that safe\nIt's a great way for you to store all your digital records you know a lot of people now use Google Photos to do it where you essentially take pictures of your documents and store them in Google Photos free storage forever\nUh the only issue with anything like that safe\nIs with

husband works for is not as generous as they used to be are they\nAre they are and what are they doing to your husband\nDo they pick up a month ago stopped matching wireline cake I check the ...\nAnd what was their reason for their sudden loss of generosity\nKnown actually no I'm not sure if they have one or or what it was\nThey said no match anymore they're offering the thing but whatever money he puts in that's all she wrote\nYeah no I don't want to do now 'cause we are able to fully fund house all by for me that we're only able to put it out I found some dollars and his four oh one K. and so I was wondering should we continue to put it and they had for Ireland K event like apple or shall we start ... of why\nGreat question so the advantage of the four oh one K. is it just comes out automatically either now or think about it and it just happens in that so that's a valuable thing not having to have the intention but getting it done but it sounds like he was a couple have been getting it done anyway with\nYour raw you're getting it fully funded so if you were to choose if you are in fact use a low cost provider for that Ross\nAll things being equal with no match and the four one K. I'd love it if he instead of contributing to the employer four one K.\nPut that five thousand or maybe bump it up to fifty five hundred into his own Roth\nOkay and would you recommend that rolling whatever it in that four oh one K. and\nYou can't do that while he works there okay\nSo the money that they're stays there but put any future contributions and do a raw I think could be very valuable\nOkay and so it's just better tax\nSo the difference is the employer plan may be a moderate costs low costs are high cost plan\nOkay but you got the underlying expenses\nIf you use one of the cheap oil companies I have on my investment guide\nThem the money is going to be going in low cost\nAnd the difference is the the four oh one K. the money that goes and gets a tax deduction up front but everything in the account including its earnings will be taxed down the road right where the Roth is the opposite the money that goes in the wrong has already been tax\nBut it grows tax free and they spent tax free now there would be an exception to him doing the Roth as an alternative what kind of money is your husband making a year in general terms\nAnd he makes last six years\nIf he's making low six figures than scratch what I said and they should stay on the four one K. F. wise that because the tax benefit\nOf being able to put money in pre tax is valuable enough at a six figure salary but in ... to his advantage to continue to put in the four one K. even without a match\nOkay but I Will say that if he is in a job in the six figures it'd be great if he put aside more money each year than the five grand\nOh God I got it okay All right but in that case with that kind of income\nHe should keep doing what he's been doing even though they're not being generous anymore are most most people don't make\nIncome and that kind of stratosphere yeah anger them for them doing the Roth would be a better choice but your husband's case the four oh one K. would probably be the best thing to continue\nTaking my call right have a great day hit you\nDavid with us on the

market as these two women are standing there\nOn a hunger strike [laughter] any might this farmer's market looked familiar in some ways it\nMight ah you had ever been to a farmer's market here yeah my\n... Hi I'm going to focus on that word here but before we get too hung up on that let me turn to Jonathan cause all would play right actors numerous from North Hampton so your play with my life and the four one three is about what\nWell one of the great things about this region is we have a lot of Venus that people can use for the various events various groups and organizations can bring their their thing to do this then you were that venue\nAnd now I'm not saying that this\nWould ever happen in our region or that this has ever happened in our region\nBut imagine what if there were a scheduling mix up as\nFar as who's using you mean someone doesn't come to the radio talk show at the time we were expected either [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] and uh\nSo so yes you suppose there was a little bit of confusion as to who's using a particular venue at a particular time and particularly what would be easy Foley soundscape of such a situation\nLet me find out what would be the landscape was such a situation any thoughts\nWell I haven't read this play I Know that there is a Frank and I are going to be very busy Frank Aaron centers my other co Foley artists there's a lot of overlap there's a lot of oh I see you've got different sounds going on at the same time yes apps discordant\nIn some well and some of the play rights now I think people now know that that part of the fun is the sound and so I'm reading some of these thinking they are trying to challenge the Foley are the how many they can put in into one\nYou know the the the ping pong table with the the D. J. rap and uh you know the ... you know it's all happening at the same time [laughter] and\nQuick detour Sam rush Foley artist is what\nWell if only artist or provides the they'll live kind of sound effects you know one film it's all of that you know when there's that fight these the artists that are actually slamming sides of beef for breaking cucumbers are salary to sound like crunching bones or you know that kind of thing but\nBelieve and I don't know really know but maybe one of you like is it that there was an individual whose name was fully think so but I'm not a hundred percent sure I think it was that was it's based on that one of the first guys who did sort of sound effects of Jack Foley Jack Foley\nUh yes so there we go\nOn time radio person I take it we know that might be\nWhy would I guess your fill maybe now owns ... radio Jack Foley April twelve Eighteen Ninety One to November night Nineteen sixty seven the developer many sound effect techniques using filmmaking ah okay yeah good research thank you so let me tell you the Internet so let me let me turn\nBack to the playwright storms and goes out what and Ellen what lingered who are your actors in all of this and where\nDid they come from and it's just I haven't met the actress who knew in my play were made on Saturday the first time and uh I'll run through it and see who they are but I'm interested to meet some new local actors\nAnd Jonathan cause same for you\nAnd I know some of the people involved and I don't want to get any names wrong okay but I'm I'm really looking forward to it because I you know I've seen these people before and they're great and I can just already imagine what\nWhat are the job they will do with my script\nLet me turn back to a sandwich for a moment if I might see in terms of the plays you assigned a theme or made a request to the play rights and then they simply not simply but then they wrote for this production is that how it works\nA works it's that way I Would say mostly like four fifths of that is correct a couple of the that's pretty good for me it's a solid [laughter] ah ah like el in the case of Allen I invited her to write something for this and uh she felt a little bit of a you know it's like twisted her arm just a little bit and she actually\nProduced a beautiful uh a thing Jonathan I think your play you a was one that you had written for maybe a previous year that we didn't select and so we decided to do it for this year Stephanie was uh\nUm [noise] aren't we should we wish I'd on board and was\nThere saw the need for this thing at and became a fundraiser for the Green Bay gets a son with me\nWe should point out that the Greensboro justice fund was founded by Marty nice and using proceeds from the court case civil court case that resulted from the assassination of her her then husband\nBy the Ku Klux Klan complicit with law enforcement so I'd like to turn a bit if I might to the celebration the service on Sunday itself again first churches this Sunday three o'clock three o'clock okay what was the surface be\nIt will be friends who will get up and speak for very briefly about what our key meant to us because I was walking down\nThe street here today realizing that\nIn the ... what I find to be very dark times I really wish I had ... next to me [laughter] she had an unstoppable spirit\nAnd optimism and joy in being with people that really pick you up when you were down ... am I right Mary\nYou are right you are re she yeah she was a person of incredible energy and ah and courage I\nThink and and that she transmitted to others and ah I think gathered us all and it made us think that we could keep going and not just could but we really months going\nI take that at the service there'll be some talks to music some are uplifting as well oh Martin is in\nAll of those things and they're also will be food if you bring it [laughter] and that we are having a pot like mum [laughter] so if you couldn't bring some finger foods or art desserts\nPlease do um everybody is invited even if you didn't know I Can't because if you didn't know\nLet's talk about her because she's out that's carried through these terrible Trump time\nAnd this is a celebration of community which is exactly what ... would have wanted and would have appreciated\nI'd like to turn to the river and in the rabbi for moments and sisters are reveling in the rabbi segment and tell you very briefly the story that I heard just a few weekends ago\nThere was a lay minister type a mood presiding over a funeral a funeral over a wedding and he was talking to a member of the clergy\nAnd the ... asking for some pointers 'cause he's never done a wedding before and the members of course he said look here's the real story and weddings nobody really cares about who you are or what you say or what you do you're just kind of there is a function or is it funerals where people were\nReally appreciate me so actually I Do know is better than weddings which sounds terrible but I think it does nearby has has has some truth\nTo it I think so I appreciate your perspective what ... us I think there's truth to it they'll seem I think there's truth to it I\nWasn't sure [laughter] he like funerals I don't want him [laughter] I may not mix\nWeddings are often about the clothes that people are wearing and\nAnd just I'm a having a really good time and the meal afterwards and I I think funerals are the most moving events that I go to a here in the city because that is when people really pay tribute to the lives of someone like\n... and are and where they do just what you are doing Mary ah and it's it's so moving and we had one for our key up at the um the race or community where we all came forward and talked about our ... and and talking about are you there was\nSo powerful bill I I I I agree there's something about the funerals where people talk about the lives of people in such a meaningful way and talk about\nThe lives of people who have passed in a way in the ways in which they have affected those who continue to live and that is so moving I think so revealing and I think is absolutely true for ... because she affected\nThousands of people in very meaningful very personal ways\nAnd we turned around by Justin David your thoughts yeah well first of all bill I think you should make an appointment with your spiritual advisor [laughter]\nSorry priority [laughter] having said that I actually I have a different kind of question for you after the show [laughter] and um\nThe this is a question for Peter but for everyone um but I but I Want to start with Peter because um when I think of someone like marquee and someone who is a role model for so many people around whom so many people clustered\nI'm from your perspective as a pastor I'm Peter and and someone who led who who led communities and still leads religious communities what does it mean to have\nSome of our key or someone like Markey in the community what does what does that do for the community and how I Am curious to hear how that one person with\nExtraordinary abilities and generosity and commitment can really shape the dynamic of a whole group of people well\nWell Mary and and money just to shut it for me too I I I mean these are hard times where we all I mean what's happening in Washington right now what's happening to our country right now is really hard it's hard for me I I wake up in the night feeling just terrible about America this time\nAnd and so someone like ... ... ... it was she really left us up and I too\nI think a park he I I live next to argue when I came to first churches or they had a parts shortage right across the street from our house in Georgia's house\nAnd so she welcomes me to North Hampton and she made me she was the ... when George for the first people to make me feel like I was really part of this community and she does this every day when we think about her yeah\nMary Santa Marta Nathan final word on the wife of mark and Mark I'm in the service and celebration of her life that will occur this Sunday at three o'clock at first churches here in North Hampton everyone has invited friends and those who simply want to know more about ...\nOr anyone who simply wants to join in this community celebration of an amazing woman\nPlease join us because I I think it will be uplifting um and I think you will feel energized and you will learn about Iraqi if you don't already know and if you do you will celebrate her and it will be so helpful to you\nLet me turn from Arizona to MORNING EDITION doctrine isn't\nI think God he tried to change\nWorld um and pretty self let's sway 'em and I think that we all see that the world needs that change and and I think\nThat community such as we
