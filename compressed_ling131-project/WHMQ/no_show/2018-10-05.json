and local news is coming up after this update from CBS at eight thirty one\nInto one of the main components to suck attached which is being is because it is the season for what's known as show means show which are what are the beans that go into ... so when when is this time of year is a time when as we talked last week when you can get show beans\nFresh and they're much quicker to cook and they're and they're not really tasty are but they're definitely quicker to cook and they are just different they they don't require the soaking and all the fuss ... not ... but it's\nPre planning that dried beans require\nAnd we're moving into the wintertime when beans are so valuable because do you know that beans have the highest protein content of any plant matter really yeah I'll be I mean you know you're talking about this kind of you were talking about ... and ...\nAs long as you have that kind of nice place to live a bean to me by the way we used to have a lot of it as kids yeah my mother made a lot of Lima beans right I I found that to be a little bit tricky but I've I've learned how to like them over the years\nBut they looked like this little piece of the classroom powers or something and they and then they you know turn into a bean that you eat how does that happen\nWell ask the Peruvians they actually were discovered in around in and around ... or ... you know work around [laughter] or South American beans beans\nBeans are basically worldwide which is what's also interesting that convenes can be from the size of a gray screen all the way up to the size of a quail egg there actually was called ... or in Italy and they are they're ... they're in the ... family wow but they're humongous\nAnd they and what's interesting also about beans is the large it isn't isn't scale the way you think like little ones don't cook more quickly than large ones actually is a lot of the larger beans cook more quickly than the little ones\nAnd all has to do with just the chemical composition and the density so that's why we soak them generally in the wintertime now if you are a beanie during you really love beans and he didn't me around you probably learned that\nIn the summertime if you do that correctly was soaking you often you'll they'll ferment on your you'll get a little bit of bubbling on the surface of the soaking water and they'll they'll taste a little funny and they'll actually give you a lot more ...\nOh yes and God Knows we don't have enough of that in our lives [laughter] for those aren't going to talk about a presidential alert [laughter] right so\nOne of the things about this great about beans is we don't tend to eat as many of them in the summertime so this isn't as big of a problem in in the cold weather when you soak them overnight usually you do it in a in an ambient or a cool room and so it doesn't occur as much this fermentation but if you if you're if you're doing it in a warm environment\nThen you can always soak beans in the ... that will prevent this from happening also the longer you soak them the more after you already have the fermentation\nAnd then once it starts there's really no way to get get rid of it you you would think that you could just rinse that off\nAnd then sold them a little bit or maybe boil and then we'll go way well it turns out doesn't it actually goes into the structure of the beans so it's it's in there for that whole batch she's which is a which is you know the way that this is like ah that's one of the things that's avoided\nThis time of year because if you're if you're eating and before they've been Dr also the other thing is a lot of the beans that you buy the supermarket not to be smart to our friends in the supermarkets but just because of the way that the\nFlow happens in food sourcing in this country\nA lot of the beans that we buy in the in the in the big stores can be two three years old the older the bean the laundry you need to soak it in the morning they are to do that fermentation\nAnd just be tough in general so if you can try to buy beans that are from a\nCompany that is more in the premium end of the spectrum and their beans or from the previous year at the leading or at the longest driven we want to look at it send you can you get their gigantic beans you talked about can you get them around here\nYou can but I don't know where ... probably places like provisions or\nMaybe ... or I mean it would be a seasonal items they probably aren't in yet because they're because they're big they take longer to grow so they wouldn't have been\nHarvested yet so it will be more around Christmas Time we used to sell them they would come in sometimes just in time for the holidays but more or less\nThe January something like they make a good ornament there are a great New Year's food because they look like a coin so there are some of the shows in Italy and do people use them because they look like the larger in the old days the larger lira\nAs a poet because when you're reading coins for good luck on New Year's day as we talked about other years of course you want to use the biggest coins you can so because or who wants good luck with a penny when you're going to because one who's over don't reverse [laughter]\nBob Hi Susan witness to the teacher could buy the ways you know the uh the red Sox open the postseason on friday did you know that the

in these last hours I'm Breathless although I knew this was coming along time you know I followed the story carefully as you have\nThe revelations come from one of the leadership in the seventh floor the FBI building something you know very well you've worked with FBI agents for years you have good friends in the FBI the seven floors the leadership these are the whole this is a wholly of holy\nAnd a man by the name of Baker who is chief counsel the FBI is said to have testified under oath to the Congress to the investigating committee at the Judiciary Committee\nThat the FBI met with\nA man by the name of ... who was representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC and from the law firm Perkins coy met with him prior to the fights a warrant being issued or thought an issue in October of twenty sixteen passed on information\nThat was consistent with the allegation that the Trump campaign was this huge of the Kremlin in other words used stab were said by the FBI to be due to the Kremlin you and everybody work within the Trump campaign\nAnd the DNC is participating in this smear\nAnd now we learn about it a year and a half later\nAfter the country has been exhausted by this false witness by all these voices all these voices\nAll from here all the way back to the Obama administration accusing Donald Trump of the trial when in fact was men who were sworn to defend the constitution the train that constitution for political gain\n[noise] yes so as a\nReformer the work of a so called a drone Solomon and now my colleague get Fox or caffeine habits has confirmed this this late this\nExplosive a testimony that was given unfortunately behind closed doors we have a man who was working with the seven for the FBI lawyer who has to be said right now worked\nHim permanently with James ... the director of the FBI about time who gave this testimony and afterwards or we have\nA Mark Meadows Jim Jordan stating that well they they wouldn't go into details but the details will come out but it is clear that the whole Russia probe the in the words was handled in an abnormal fashion and curly\nCurly was um based upon political bias so everything we've heard from stroke from paid from the cave about it being absolutely above board completely normal now we have somebody on the record of the highest levels of the FBI saying no\nThere's a backstory this was a classic political job which would then relate to be a very old in the the the uh the image of being just a regular law enforcement procedure\nThe case now and it's incomplete you hadn't I Do not have it but I think but I read what is being argued is that the insurance that truck mentioned in one of his um on unacceptable communications the insurance he's talking about\nIs the construction of that fight the war to permit the FBI and the national security apparatus to continue to serve veil the Trump campaign after the election during the transition during the first months of the Trump Administration when you were working in the White House\nThe FBI tricked the court ... court\nIn ... giving it to license to use political agents to spy on an elected president of the United states it's a it's breathtaking ... it's a plot it's a plot for Hollywood\nIt's it's a ... the most Hollywood backers would actually say through far far fetched to move forward and through the the realm of fantasy but it explains to me for example why uh after I'd been in the White House for for six months and had been trying to\nGet the FBI for work on a certain issue that was the import through to the west wing when I had a a senior age a lot of political appointee a professional a special agent or the FBI\nExplained to me why we were having such problems with the bureau which let's remind also is part of the executive and therefore works for the president who was elected by the will of the people\nI mean the agent told me you have to understand Sebastian\nThe seven pool look at this White House of the ... I'm not as a direct quote John [noise] what does it say about the the the the average true the allegations\nOf corruption over these people that sixty million Americans speak\nThey choose on the person they choose is deemed by the political appointees of the last administration to be the enemy opium people's choice\nThe midterms coming and people are going to make a decision in November about the Congress not the White House if the president was on the ticket I wouldn't be even slightly worried however the Congress we watch called\nThe good news for the Republicans right now\nUm is that the Senate races are moving their way yes in fact I'm struck by the fact that I'm speaking to Montana right now a missile test or who is standing for re election and was involved in unfortunate and unacceptable remarks about a member of the administration\nBringing forth facts about a car incident that didn't happen and it broken admirals a career\nOr that same Mr tester is now voting against Kavanaugh and they're running an ad in Montana right now saying you can't trust tests are well I don't think you can\nBut I thought he was going to win win reelection and it's now been moved to toss up the house however at the house is in play because of all the suburban districts and people who buy the Russia story they're voting on a false ...\nYes but I I I'm not sure that the significant margin or or that they will call to choose one because if if you look I mean I Know you follow so for me to arm on at fault too much in the last week just talking to my conservative friends and just just viewing the trends on social media\nThe anger is palpable I have a ten years that I've lived in America I've never seen this this a level of and express freely and it's clear that in many cases the capital trial by will deal has and get individuals who otherwise wouldn't have voted for Trump\nBob ... book the the big\n... showing that things are sure I ... ... says at any of those yes in cap is closed\nThe gap is closing whether it's a boy up here in Virginia or whether you're talking about pets though or hard cap that is that for the\nTrend which is the director Kobach but what the Democrats have been trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh why we fight the new book from Sebastian Gorka I'm John bachelor\n\nThe audio H M [noise] mostly\nWe're overnight lower fifty two fifty eight parts

one on one five Seventy five WHM pie [noise]\nA given to the border guards for the A's off the which is what is the opposite the Russians this seems inadequate response Victor your measure is Secretary Mattis ready to overwhelm the Russians are we going to just take small steps here\nAnd I think Russia's a special case because it's located so deeply within American politics because of the two thousand six\nElection this field office here in the fall I think mostly for all falls charges of Russian collusion that\nAnything that we do with Russia than gets contextualize it's either Trump is trying to overreact to prove that he didn't include or he's not doing enough because it's gluten so it'd be very careful and then\nThey they understand that traditionally there had been a\nKiss set or Henry Kissinger like balancing the China with Russia in our interests would have won all three of the other sort of a\nTruck parked type max Mexican scandal that we've lost that ability so they really I think we're confused now\nWhat is the right level responsible politically or home and geostrategic ... and then there's the other problem drawn to that the the two are not quite the same Ukraine and crime mayor because after all World War two the Russians lost a hundred thousand people could see chips about PSA pool\nAnd uh they they bled army groups out white\nUh in Nineteen forty two is a is it tried to go home and that and and they did on next week comes to crime may have that for them\nIt's a holy battleground will probably three or four hundred thousand Russian soldiers died so and their way of thinking they're saying you know this is this is our our ... or something and so there's so many there's so many\nI guess contours historical contemporary all to extract strategic food it's it's almost balcony about what we can do what we should do I know one thing because I I was a colleague of James Mattis I don't think he will ever\nA issue of red line that he will not feel that he can still so it's not going to give a stepper were lined up in the case of the Obama administration and the ...\nI moved to NATO this is Kay Bailey Hutchinson the ambassador to NATO making remarks about the violations of the start treaty the Russians have built a new rocket system and intermediate range ballistic missiles the ... the the fear here and as it was in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd nineties before the start treaty was that there is no warning time with missiles that fire that are intermediate range it's over with\nYou have to shoot first or you will lose or the Russians are set by the Trump Administration to be in violation of the stock trading do we enforce it is there a remedy for Secretary Mattis\nWhile I I think that if you look at the totality of the Trump national security team pumped peyote state and Bolton was national security advisor have union but you and ... they're all born on this scale understand that that's an intolerable\nAsymmetrical situation so they're going to try to find some way and I I don't know where they're going to go on to revert to the Russian Reagan esque way\nYou know that if they could and then we put a pushing missiles but they will do something because uh even their NATO allies will find out intolerable and we're already seeing that Scandinavian nations like sweet and we consider any more or activity\nParticipation with NATO and Trump has really made it pretty clear that you guys are on the frontlines you guys being the NATO members and you're very naive about Russia and if you want us to take a leading in the tour in them and we're going to have to step up and\nWith military mommy mommy monetary and military conch and so I think

Jim be [noise]\n\nMeaning I'm John bachelor this is the John ... show I'm joined by my colleague can cohost Malcolm whole line conference of presidents major American Jewish organizations we move immediately to the news in\nThese last days foreign policy news I understand the domestic policy is dominated all of the cable televisions in the front page of the New York times but when the fog lives we will get back to the threat\nTo our ally Israel and to peace in the middle east represented by Iran and the Trump Administration and the person as secretary of state Mike Pompeo tail and national security adviser and are longtime friend John Bolton had been busy these last days\nCorral in what is left on the Iranian aggression\nSecretary said my my my ... an ounce on Wednesday that the U.S withdrawing from the Nineteen fifty five treaty of apathy with Iran after Tehran successfully made an international complain that Washington had violated\nThat of course this is a puzzle unless you understand the diplomatic dance that's going on in the middle east as my first guest does Michael saying\nIs the ... senior fellow in managing director at the Washington Institute bike a very good evening to you the U.S is withdraw from the treaty of and that he looks like paperwork\nWhere is it going what is this to indicate a what the next steps good evening to\nClaiming Malcolm and Canadian John you know I think a lot of people look at this withdrawal as well as the other withdrawal it was announced by national security adviser John Bolton the same day from\nA more secure treaty and they'll say about that sort of par for the course of the Trump Administration withdrawing from after withdrawing from the Paris accords withdrawing from the nuclear deal\nBut in fact I think withdrawing from the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity Andy meaning friendship with a regime which we've had a hostile relationship since Nineteen Seventy nine which probably an overdue step frankly\nUm if if you look John at or what the icy gay the international court of justice for the world court it's sometimes called I ordered the United states to do is actually a company United States is perfectly willing to do it not make exemptions to allow humanitarian trade with Iran I I think what the administration really objects to though\nIs the very idea of the ice CJ has asserted jurisdiction in this issue because of the United states this is about national security and it's not really subject to the world courts jurisdiction\nAnd it's a matter of national sovereignty also\nUh having them into fear and as you said America does give humanitarian exemptions and has always provided for it but you know when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming under the disguise of of being humanitarian need when we know that the Iranians civilian aircraft are being employed in Syria\nAnd deployed caring troops and doing other things so it is not a non military issue when they talk about the um ... certainly in the military equipment and we know the mullahs sell a lot of that medicine so so in fact the United states cases\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm John ... with Malcolm whole lot\nSyria and Russia are separate story from Iran and Russia because of the ongoing conflict because of the promises made and\nThe question is blood and treasure ... invested the ideal of boats and right now Latimer potent is quoted most recently in the times of Israel saying all foreign troops should leave Syria after the war\nI guess Malcolm that means the Iranians to I suppose that would be the logic of that and Turks and everybody else but after the war as the catchphrase how\nThat happened we welcomed born ... who can help us to get this careful lawyers language by the former KGB agent uh Boris a very good evening to you of foundations the defense of democracies we take you to Syria the recent shoot down to the Russians surveillance crap\nLed to twenty four forty eight hours of turmoil in the Kremlin and in Jerusalem and in Damascus blame shifting the Russians responded by saying we'll issue as three hundred system\nTo the Syrians who had managed to shoot down a Russian craft\nFollowing er during an Israeli airstrike or how do you measure the relationship between Damascus and the Clinton than right now is it one of confidence is it one of just trust is there a betrayal of like good evening to bar\nA gaming and thanks for having me on I think it's the episode is certainly deeply embarrassing uh for ... you have a client or the side regime shutting down one of your own aircraft with weapons that you saw them you know a long while ago as to hundreds\nI'm In a ... system that really can't tell friend her phone I've kind of one on one of one of the problems there\nAre for the for the Russians are but it's deeply embarrassing and I think they use this as an excuse\nI'm to transfer the as three hundreds to the Syrians will resort video of earlier this week um they've been wanting to do is and so he's twenty Thirteen if not earlier or they had to deal with Israelis back twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously that this\nUh this incident with the excuse that they've been looking for to quickly go ahead and move forward the transfer\nWho we had very complicated situation just as a one reflection of it when you have the as three hundred are coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the S. four hundred supposedly the most advanced the system is are the\nThe Chinese and there'd been threats by the U.S about sanctions on to pets uh\nUh the countering America's adversaries who sanctions act in other um measure ... what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding turkey and trying to do they go to the mat on it and how will it affect Turkey's relationship\nIt within the Russian orbit\nLook I already saw at the top twenty at the trauma diminish racial issue the sanctions the cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOr one Chinese agency and the Chinese individuals and executive director of that aid for their purchase of as four hundred at the core thirty five fighter jets are so I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese to the Turks\nUm there was this report today that the Indonesians are putting on hold a their purchase of sick or thirty fire fighter jets because of their concern about sanctions\nSo ... should be taking this seriously that um you know the top of the recession has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions or not if they follow through on sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the the lights should be flashing red or for turkey whether they actually stop 'em you know I I I'm pessimistic I think they go they go through with it\nBut boy I'm I'm On a press you on how the Russians deal with Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first grade throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working in ...\nDo the Russians trust Assad in any fashion have they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\n[noise] or is this your how one person basically making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this kind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal with the Assad regime for uh the base in Tartus a naval base it on the air base I mean\nUm and so they they're holding on and there's no there's no\nPolitical alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody else that can basically guarantee 'em their equities\nUh in in Syria so I'm not sure it's a if it's a matter of crossing or not but it's that's the kind of [noise] they've got the foot hold down to a locked and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure you know how ... ... there's not there's no other way to them for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or are there key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we do the Russians are dealing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of dealing with dealing with the Assad regime in a very\nI'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting what they need to target and same with the Iranians\nUm and so I think it's a it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they get the three hundreds to Assad it's more about making sure that as the kind of that crack troops that Assad hazard or really lax\nUh don't end up sitting up there on aircraft as we saw when it's incident that they have something that's more advanced now that can actually tell Russian aircraft from Israeli aircraft are from you know other aircraft\nYou know we have another front where we're seeing a an ally a moving closer to Russia in some regards to visit a president Sisi of Egypt and to Russia I think when this empty to Sochi do\nYou see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now that they've consolidated the hold in Syria a naval air force base they long sought based in the ... in in Egypt what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean it's I think it's just it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean ... visited Egypt cc's previously visited Russia as well uh they're signed kind of a slew of military and economic cooperation deals but on the military side we haven't seen\nSome of the kind of basic things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on the agenda the Soviets had some basis in in western um\n[noise] in western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some of the naval kind of access they had um military and they were actually had to Egypt and put in parts there so I think that's what's really interesting to watch\nThat this trip is coming about fairly quickly um and again build on already military and economic idealistic made in the past couple of years so it's it's it it should be concerning for the U.S where you have\nIs you have to traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get cozy or with the Russians and part of that is we're we're not engaging with them you know we still\nI'm Still waiting for a in a bathroom Egypt to be named or the state department or David shank or that says a factory for Near East still has not been\nUm confirmed by the Senate\nUm so they're still we're we're kind of still playing this game of of catch up on the diplomatic front while the Russians are clearly pushing I had a\nJust a detail here now where we are in the scheme of things the principle of guns ready five dollars and I'm told by informed sources\nCycle it's nothing different about the Iranian upset is affecting it does that give Russia more leverage in the world because their coffers are good above sixty dollars a barrel\n[noise] they're they're they're tricky position where they I think there there are plenty for around fifty five dollars for their budgets fake don't actually can't domestically deal with\nPrices that are hundred odd or more because they're you know they had their their own domestic prices for oil gas goods commodities whatever struck going up\nAnd the Russian economy is not doing very well uh inflation's up in an all those things so that you see some kind of some small protest some some kind of\nSome some some issues domestically for so I think there's a sweet spot for them uh I Know it's kind of maybe it wasn't it was like oh you know where it goes up to twenty dollars a barrel it's great for the Russians\nYou know if the economy was doing better a

really ready for war\nWelcome us doesn't want war is a ... the leader in God's I sang but at the same time they want to see escalation they want to see brinkmanship in bringing more and more escalation on the one hand but look losing control in a way that would lead them to overlook all out war because they know they were not going to gain anything out of that\nAre embedded with the logic behind because if they escalate from federal they planned for for a year it's already fighting\nA full today are they a lot of planning is that this will cause to go to the Egyptians and asked them to convince her mother to believe or money to Hamas\nUh the the refused to book a because it will be so ah concerned about the possibility of a break up with another war in God\nSo because of that everybody here expects a collision along the border uh this is not yet a ... going to be older to most a coal miner says it's not going to be ... a kind of a war that we had in the box nobody expects now\nFor our forecasts but a more oil spill season along the border\nOr maybe some a use of a squirrels and explosives and the you know I'm more a driveway and the Israelis are already preparing

of a ... by the Hamas uh Venus Asians that's what's going on\nSo the information is that Hamas is is is in position to start a rocket barrage of get\nThe information but they don't want to go there they they developed a law that is a an awful lot of options that these ... lower than they use a for rockets\nAnd they hope that are going through there will be enough in order to cause these live to a approach the options on the phone so forth which is happening anyhow we were five minutes with al ... the\nPresident to see the uh when they were in New York and uh that was given a clear a message yesterday when he met with the chancellor America that the expects them to the limit the money to to Hamas\nOr to Gaza and ah so he's one of these is doing a Hamas expects it to do but\nUh it's very difficult to convince unable Mazen Mazen has no we're inclination to help\n'em they're just on the country wants to push a to put more pressure on them\nAnd the complicated situation it seems that the escalation for the coming days is almost inevitable\nSo the hot issue obviously has been the delivery of the three hundred to Syria\nAnd you've been a military analyst than than the winter very distinguished career in the military and ... how do you assess is what it what is the Israel has a complex in a relationship with Russia\nIn on many fronts and and ... spoken highly and and even defensively but Israel um ... what does that this is this a beginning a new period do do they really turn to you as three hundred to the Syrians\nOr how how will this change the relationship or impact\nOf course makes our ability to operate in Syria more complicated\nAnd on the ... the rain or your age when was the uh the Russians and the Iranians\nCan more or less do what ever they think necessary in order to help us\nBut whenever the Iranians they use the theory of Syria in order to promote the DVDs that are dangerous for it even has the rights to ah take action against it and uh it just has to coordinate with the Russians to avoid the friction\nAh by this move that follows the follow the ah event in which they lost a plane or the Russians and love fixing a sort of a ... a move to the Russian was\nIf you change the equation and to prevent that from ... and that's the action against a hearing in ... I'm about to build the terror attacks\nAgainst does that help Russia Russia who doesn't want to see Iran and certainly ... getting these weapons so doesn't isn't Israel doing those ... I don't\nKnow I think the the Russia doesn't carry a while I get these weapons and doesn't care that much if Iran continues to bring into the weapons in Syria into a base from which can operate against maybe they don't care that much they don't care if we take action to prevent it but they don't care if the if it does happen\nAnd all our efforts to convince the the Russians were to prevent Iran from bring that are working so I'm now ... Singh ... much more complicated situation\nIt was a committed to keep working against the Iranian feed it to you but I think that the one before is this going to happen now is the Russia\nYes you mentioned it has to be now much more than a committed them loose pleasurable in preventing Iran from bringing the weapon because otherwise you know we'll have to operate in the presence of the three hundred ... a few months\nAnd they may go in the skin Asian if this were how the flu and be able to ah shut down and Israeli plane because it's going to be a reason for why north connection to Russia have to pick this new book out\nGenerally go see Cooper fought so the ...

S. capitalist system is to beat the U.S campaign as anti Israel activism and so when I see Andrew Gillum so closely tied in fact we put a photo of a Andrew Gillum from his Facebook page in two thousand and four camp\nA ... in which he says court could not be prouder of Philip avenue and again avenue is the founder of dream defenders that he wrote a glowing profiled out to me I think Andrew Gillum needs to be asked some serious questions about\nHis deep association and promotion of a group that is anti Israel anti capitalist while he is trying to portray himself\nAs the opposite as pro Israel or even ... I've gone through interviews that he gave as recently as just a few months ago where he a hot strongly criticized the Israeli military and their response in Gaza and really set some anti Israel\nWhy does why does the mayor of Tallahassee talk about what goes on in Gaza how does that connector\nWell unless he seemed to have been trying to position himself even there for support from these protests have grown\nSo that's what he has in common with celebrate these are two agile actors in the progressive part of the Democratic party seeking fun by speaking against Israel does it work\nAnd the oh

because huge lead ... leads early from the east but it's not so California is confirmed by about I think thirty two hundred votes and take some time for the votes to be gathered in California\nThat Wilson goes over the top of the electoral college striking to me is the fact that you provide that hire him Johnson\nWins California by two hundred and sixty thousand some incredible amount yeah Ron Johnson the leading progressive ... meeting George as fat and his father so if if Roosevelt had been uh been the ticket they would've carry California easily with that scale of progressive votes in

Michael yeah Michael J. Fox he makes fun of him too and so uh it's the same time you are like that but that that's at the same thing you know and then when he made fun of Michael J. totally made fun of my 'cause if you eat a man of his mannerisms it's as if he was faking it almost ... accused Michael J. Fox has taken on the campaign trail\nYou're talking about Rush Limbaugh no no no no no need to make fun of him he just said that he didn't take ... pills that day or something\nHe is he is this going to hurt Trump because there's now seems to be a tremendous backlash here from the from from the women especially in the me too movement marches everything else and when he just dismisses her and makes fun of her and all that and I doesn't this for him in the long run I mean does it do you think the first of all I didn't\nThink I don't think he was that dismissive I thought he was then and I think the Republicans in general are really working hard and their own narrative to be respectful and\nI listen to her and they made it for months before bless you've already been testified in and tell you I tell you last week and I tell you two weeks ago to do it a lot of members of the things you've told me that's great because it went by when you are right all the time and that's why I'm going to be off by three days and if they didn't want him but I this is going to hurt\nThis is going to hurt Democrats and the long run how so\nBecause like you said the second vents us crazy Trump I mean those are really crazy Trump loyalists are are going to be fired up they're gonna come out and vote or people in the n._r._a. are mad because they tried to stop this guy and they're going to come out and vote people and you know and that's going to affect Alaska because Martin and I'm a ... it's going to have\nTo vote for Kavanaugh because I don't think so ... you're going to lose I don't want no way you look at the time something else\nIt's going to its firing up his crazies it's fighting and the ... firing up\nThe pro life the the pro life people but most importantly there's that small percentage of of neutral voters they're people who are not a moron that they're not they're not political ah ah hacks they're not the the automatic Republican or democratic vote\nFor Hillary one week for Trump in our paper we pay attention to these Michael hits all in the middle of the people in the little thing this whole theater and they're saying oh my God this is ridiculous what are you familiar with those people are going to come out and vote more here what\nTrump is planning to he's playing to a pretty good segment of the country that is a little bit sick of accusations that come from twenty thirty four years ago but the me too movement is all about that because twenty Thirty years ago if you did make a complaint you wouldn't have been believe then you would have been ostracized you lost your job and everything else so there's a point\nTo be easy well that and that's where they're making their mistake then I said last week to conflate in two different things right there is the one thing that this has been an ongoing situation that really finally needs to be addressed where you see people all throughout the movie industry politicians corporate people and they are are are women have been abused\nRight but they're trying to combine that with you automatically have to believe lazy ... blazing Ford Dr blaze even more or less ... before you automatically have to do\nThe Republicans go out of the way to call her doctor for two can you imagine what they're saying in their cars to name that they have where it begins with sea but okay go ahead\nNo no hold me day or at least a gentleman okay there's nothing that average okay spent the point is the point\nIs right it's it's two different things yes it goes on but by again and it's the same thing that I've been talking about for lock them by embellishing right and and ... and making trying to make one thing to\nYou know all all women need to be believed all all cases need to be investigated all women who are abused\nNeed to come forward right but I mean you can't a cue you can't say that person is guilty because that person said they're guilty right so women need to come forward and it's not easy for a limited come forward because this is extremely traumatic right\nI Would say yeah okay so so why did she come forward is she making it up is that what is that where Republicans believe because I think a lot of people in the country who are Trump backers\nWould say that well here here's what happened right she sent a letter to a congresswoman from California who gave it to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein had it in early July we\nWere talking about this like the Republicans do about this when Feinstein going also stopped and it's ridiculous the Republicans do about this the whole time and they're pretending that the Democrats held the evidence that whatever it is and like we had overthrown and a domino effect crop this woman up why would they do this we know for a fact\nThat Feinstein had this in early July we have no facts whatsoever of factual is with a metal Republicans knew it so that you can keep secrets in Washington I think they kept that it's a dry\nAnd I think then they relieve all his friends and I think about what well here's what there is some there are some things that are bothersome about about the theater and this and again it goes back to is it really helped by embellishing instead of just putting the facts out there they would have they've they've hurt their own cause\nThe mainly the Democrats and yeah and they don't give them then what are they embellish I've ... I forget we just talk about whatever you may embellishing\n... instead of just saying it coming out in June ... June July and saying this woman makes this claim that we could have investigated for three weeks and months right\nHe's convicted for year what are you going to find\nThe investigator you've done a more thorough investigation right where they have done an investigation of bless you for to make these accusations at the age of Fifteen what they've done an investigation then\nThat's the whole crux

com\nI teach also for coming in with a little bit more ...\nAfro ... thank you\nMe and a conflict of interest when a candidate that\nBaby shock was over it as a southerner twenty eight and our morning here on one side Ronald Donald the president of the north temperate city council will join us at seven thirty seven this morning right now they're starting to check in with Chris Collins the colors report rocky by ... the no ... no gimmick dealer on main street\nIn Greenville another insurance bait and switch I'm Chris Collins a new health insurance rules being viewed by some as one more blow to people with preexisting conditions\nThe Trump Administration rule allows insurance companies to expand the feel of short term insurance plans that don't cover benefits deemed essential buddy Affordable Care act\nCheryl fish park in with Families USA says the plan that includes some fine print loaded with exclusion\nPeople have bought plants like this in the past and then found out that they literally covered nothing for the condition that they thought they were covered for\nThe administration says expanding the availability of short term plans gives consumers more options for purchasing health insurance the rule goes into effect this month and appears to be another example of a disturbing trend\nA a infrastructure you really just increasing the supply and if you go into the future may look fossil or natural gas maybe cheap now it may not be that way or in in ten years but you still going to have this thing and you're going to have to pay for it\nTo build the white and Elizabeth Cline from ward seven they were the ones that are kind of put this on ... a big march on a Thursday or concerning the er Holyoke asked electorate ... from Edwin Holyoke I Want to build a pipeline do you think that will get the same amount of ... that happened in Franklin County\nWith the with a pipeline opposition it's a good question I mean the ... uh I you know as you point out I was not an author of this resolution but a a resolution opposing the uh the Tennessee gas pipeline which most of his Franklin County was the first resolution I wrote a city council Iraq after I was elected in twenty Thirteen\nAnd Northampton was the first city to take a stand against in many other towns of course but I think it was because of the actions of um different towns across Massachusetts that in part was defeated and um I think it's important for us to stand up for our our principles on on this one\nSo we'll see I'm obviously Columbia gas is dealing with a lot these days because of the matter of fact valley yep that's got to affect this project here in western mass I Would think a in a negative way from their perspective given all that they're dealing with so very much up in the air is a good time to send a message that you know north Memphis not particularly interested in in being\nUm ah the reason for the construction of new pipeline\nAnd Maureen card even from a ward one city councilor and she's got a friend who was made by the explosion\nI Know that would be Roger Roger ... where does it stand right now where does it the next up with this so I may pass unanimously and uh we vote and everything twice in the city council two weeks will vote again ah I I feel confident saying that you know the major vote was was last night Mm hum\nAnd we'll see I mean we've sent request to Columbia gas before and messages before you know when they put the moratorium in and I I asked can we have some data back in the south is there a reason why you need to put more to because\nI'm not going to why this is a hard it's hard vote is is not just something that you want to do for any logical reasons you have to realize that people suffer because of the moratorium\nFor example the lumber yard project before the housing project they wanted to use natural gas and that they couldn't a net switch to a different source which is more expensive so it was real it was a real issue here and we asked give us the data\nTestify this never heard back ... so I mean we\nWe shall see in Ronald Donald's was the president of the north Hampton city council and they had to some committees are recently to discuss their reforming the housing authority oh you are someone with some of the some of the input that came out of that\nYou know I mean I'm excited about this this is a proposal that I put forward to ask the legislature for um a permission to change the membership the housing forty north Hampton that's because the the new housing authorities are stab us not by the city but by the state and what it would do is add tenants to the housing board\nA and I just think if you have tennis on the housing board ... or you're going to a better results are going to better oversight better policy making the conditions in in housing authorities across Massachusetts are deplorable\nAnd ever since I was in a war three and you know worked with people inside the house and kale apartments I really wanted to do something that's really hard to help people because they're really off on these legal islands ... where they just I mean they're just invisible almost in powerless and uh\nSo I liked the idea of doing something to empower them\nAnd this proposed going forward the people came up to the committee meetings are far more persuasive than I Know we have people from half your heights and several house come out and tell their stories about what they face every day and they're very supportive of this idea\nUm so what we're hoping to do is have two more forums these were committed means you won't have real a community forums or the next month and a half a and hear from everybody and hopefully put up hopefully put a legislative proposal forward a and change things that the housing authority\nAnd of course the the new director ... probably the dropped two years now or ... yeah now she's she's made some changes not all of them yeah you know with any kind of a ... of paper\nYeah she's them some rocky rocky road um I I think this is a you know same old thing you you need to have some checks and balances and you have ... the management of the housing authority north Hampton and\n... are not impugn in um uh uh her motivations or decisions\nI'm saying this but you need to have oversight and I just think it'd be think about if you live in a condo and everyone you're condo association were appointed by somebody else and didn't even live there it would make any oversight and accountability is um the way to improve things I think\nRon O'Donnell's here the president of the Northampton she calls will take a break for sports and whether and talk about the red Sox game tonight with the yanks but do I want to get your perspective but you just finished a grueling or race or came up a little short for the state Senate the joke coming for the one that to uh to replace Jane Rosenberg\nAnd uh I Wonder did your your reflection on that

I was a tennis player for many many years in fact to go out and my oldest son and I used to play before school it was back when he was to look at JFK middle school or something and ah we play the tennis courts at ... park and by the way it did I heard the rumors that they're going to install\nA pickle ball court one or two pickle ball courts in the ... the tennis courts and look part\nA pickle ball another of variation of tennis that is a pretty cool we played a little bit\nLast summer I think I told you the story was an amazing thing we got to my sister in law\nWho works for a a sports a company\nA it gave us this set of a pickle ball ... I was very interested in I'd watch a couple of videos on pickle ball and say hey I was pretty interesting she says hey I can get your one so she gave us this set this up a pickle ball sat\nOn the big box and on the box it just shows you the dimensions right to the court is exactly forty feet long and the twenty feet wide as it turns out my driveways exactly twenty twenty feet wide so this is gonna be cool\nSo we got up there with chalk much sunshine and I we laid out this court just the dimensions that round the boxing ring and the unions hosted the Centre part is twenty feet across his great so we get the sidewalk chalk or where you are probably spend an hour on this thing lining up to court okay great now reached with a net then that's twelve feet\n[laughter] like you come up with that\nOn the box it gives the dimensions you must make the Centre part you must make that twenty feet across\nAnd then they give you a twelve foot net also enough that the kind of breaks at the bottom so the the ball and go right through so it just it was one of these it's one of these kind of a low grade or sports or affiliate said a self sports equipment and so they probably have some nuts left over from some other some other promotion\nOr those necessarily for the pile I put them in the box [laughter] so and so we we still managed to play a game of some sort but anyway go pickle ball is a\nKind of getting pretty popular and it looks like they're putting in a court look for the rumor that we're hearing is that they're going to devote to some of the test scores but anyway I played tennis reason I play ping pong for a long long time probably even before I play tennis\nSo it's a it's a it's a great game but twelve hours or it's uh it can be interesting to you would take it your body would just fall apart after a while but I actually gotten better last year I got better the day wore on so it's kind of and I can remember um\nOh there's a whole bunch of moments that come out at your but uh the lowly in town of ... a play of course you know she's a as you know she's a really really good athlete and\nSo she played me and we played many times you play ping pong and I always feel entered a little bit better than her but she got inspired and her aunt Patti actually sponsored her and\nShe was really into the cause and all so and she was so happy when she beat me and she'll be legitimately I I I don't give anything away and this thing so if you if you're interested in plain\nA you must know that uh I just my style a little bit if you haven't played in a long long time I'm not gonna you know jam it down just from what I Try to do is I Try to return everything so um you know I I definitely you know you bring the velocity down a little bit of our planes someone who was not very experienced and then I met rack up playing somebody really good\nUm but I ...

I think Kyrie Irving the drive through that oh you did about our stuff okay right so he had the problem with a with\nThe ... I went to a meeting of flatter society wants how did that go it went\n[laughter] uh it\nWas interesting I never mind\nYeah no I I've been to Northampton ah the ah we didn't go to the moon a conspiracy theory meeting as well yeah a very exciting I anyway I Can't say anything more about that\nOkay me they made it his comments in Illinois so when we're talking\nAbout the solar system usually a stronger more is divided up as the inner solar system that has all the major a planet or so or again out up to a ... to\n... and then uh you have the outer solar system which is more like a icy or ... balls the icy balls of rocky ice falls over how about whatever you want to call it that is where you have objects like Pluto now people are but those are in that context okay\nWell in in months he's famous famous a statement regarding Voyager Voyager in fact took photographs of what looked like\nIcy rocks but are well is a planet\nRight and and and right now as well I mean the ... that's ... that that is in fact at the outer edge of the inner ... right I'm into a I mean again there is no actual\nBoundaries there is no border there is no sign on and certainly the average guy or that the loser the influence of gravity way out of their way out to vote for for Voyager we are still talking about\nA little bit inside of it and so those objects have called\nA trance Neptune or or object so basically they are after the orbit of\nNeptune racing you just told us I thought that this new planet yes is circling will not circling that's all the wrong word but his is in an orbit around the sun and elliptical orbits\nAnd so billions of\nMiles away that's correct the sun is still is hurting its gravitational force on this relatively small object right that is correct okay\nIt would keep on existing it's a grab all they're all ... all the way out to a trillion I'm close to it for their minds as well but but we'll come back to it in a second okay right after the nephew into orbit or what but people call ... beyond Neptune czar but you have quite for about\n... belt is place where you have an object like Pluto as well you have asteroids are in there as well and you have rocky ice ... around that park okay\nNow that are also object beyond quite about and again there is no particular boundaries of ... which is called sort of like scattered desk a where objects have tilted orbits\nThis object that we are talking about for example a T. G. three eighty seven or ... that goblin I mean this is around that place now you also have beyond they scattered desk beyond ...\nYou have a big cloud a cloud doesn't mean you know cloudy but it means that they are billions off these icy balls which are a part of what the strong in what's called the org cloud this is a spherical your body the or or Artie\nThat'd be cool if there were a horse and God [laughter] it is the or clouds which\nExtends almost a light beer from our son so that is about a trillion kilometers a tend to including kilometers and so we are still part of our soldiers are still part of our solar system and that really extends way out and\nDid it a question and of course we cannot see most of these objects in fact we don't see ... I mean pretty much none of these objects the ... the reason we know they exist\nIs because these bodies sometimes come in to the solar system goes to the ... and they appear to us as comics now that our comments that have come some come from\nThe ... area so those are short period comments like Haley's comment which comes every or whatever like you know a Seventy six years or so\nBut then you have these long period comments that come from way out and some of these comments where they're coming from the old club we may see them come only once because they always maybe\n... years or maybe they are just coming in and then they go out of the solar system they are but it's such that they're no longer bound by it and they might just leave\nSo some comments are in orbit in an orbit\nAround the sun in some configuration\nRight huh I mean I was at all comments are actually about almost all but sometimes somebody skating right become escape also if they if they're so the question is yes okay so if if I may\nAsk then we'll get to the west ... street questioned Wyoming coming\nTo this one I mean if they are living out in the\nCloud I mean why why bother why why such a wonderful and they already have and so happy over there and why did they have to come to our neighbor well I mean so we think\nThat maybe a collision with another a body or maybe some like you know some gravity often maybe some other star or something like that an impact\nBut there are ... get disturbed by something and and that gets them to come in towards the part of the solar system this is related to and and the reason I was a little bit hesitant because sometimes the student they orbit changes but it still remains within the gravity\nThe sun and their period is really long but occasionally they all would be such that ah their speed is too much and then they escaped from our solar system that can happen\nSo I have a remedial question could you clarify clarify for me the difference between meteors in comments comets and asteroids\nYes so comments are are icy bodies rocky icy bodies of uh whereas uh asteroids that are mostly rocks and so there is an asteroid belt\nWhich is between Mars and Jupiter which we think it was sort of like the leftover material from the beginning from the formation of the solar system and big cause of Jupiter's gravity\nThere wasn't enough a devoted enough perturbations have this material could not get together to form into a Planetree size body and so these are rocks or some of them are very small um\nUMass Amherst ... you know I Want to keep those cards and letters coming into\nAn e mails max page I understand from your text this morning that you want to reveal that you in fact no one Brett Kavanaugh and had\nWell a\nInteractions so share with us\nAll right well that's a little bit of exaggeration says what are the only but it's not a total lie it's pretty good for this confirmation yeah right [laughter] or an ice teas early on in the show he was a year ahead of me in\nCollege and I knew if they'd far away from\nThe world of his super prep school\nBeak buddies but I knew that you ... yeah he was a year ahead and you know when I look at your book pictures of like the deep fraternity he was in a like I remember that guy remember that guy and it you know it all fits them a fully fully um believe\nEverything that the ... of Deborah Ramirez and Christine budget forward have been saying I mean there's a world there was a world of incredible privilege and I'm an enormous drinking in such a district behavior that one witnessed around a lot now I Know that happens a lot of\nColleges but there was a particular 'cause it's very very wealthy privileged jock culture that he was clearly a part of that has been part of Yale for as long as anyone ... that was George Bush's fraternity too at you\nThe that prep school Ivy League college continuum is something that is well not exactly a secret to those who were part of it and uh I don't know how John Kerry seemed to escape it but he did that\nSaid or did he we don't know well he hasn't been accusing any well it's interesting when I was there\nFraternities were really a very tiny part of social life but they were just beginning on the ascent in fact there was a group in the ... my freshman year called the jerky defeat men's drinking club which became\nA revitalized I don't know if the states where that's where the other other fraternities or people were from there to se or to de ... or like some of us became nerds and went to the library [laughter]\nYou didn't get that prescription bones no ours these fraternities I mean I couldn't tell you if I did I Know what I did I [laughter]\nLike those guys did it have been actually a number of them who do I remember seeing freshman year in this kind of nailed debauchery then went on to um go bones and those other fraternities and then you become a Supreme Court justice warm secretary of state\nI thought that the question about whether he has suffered a blackout actually was unfortunately not a good question because it's being asking ... was asking Kevin Oh the impossible to know which is if he blacked out how was he remembered that's the whole point of a blackout you don't remember it including what you don't remember so\nThat kind of excessive drinking I take it with something that you saw from afar of course max page but something that was very real and everyone knew about it and or was part of our observed it or was affected\nBy any of us did it myself included but then there's a choice at which you which direction you go and whether you you you go all in in that kind of world and there was a there was a lot of that that that went on you know I I just feel like it in his\nCosts of admission you generally as I understand that for those really elites are drinking clubs you had to come from wealthy you had to come from privileged you have to remember the country club you had to go to a prep school you had to really be ... and you know it's a public school nerd ... application not accepted for this crime\nWell look I mean that's that's what sort of studying ... to me I have a friend who was\nYounger than Brett Kavanaugh in his you know the ideal they called the colleges dormitories abrupt four hundred people he\nDidn't know him and he ... none of his friends my friends in my class in that college had no idea in other words they isolated themselves off they had they're kind of world which they were they they found themselves to me um there is that what my only hope still and maybe there's no hope left but I feel like\nThe level the free forum lying on small issues and big issues might might I'm probably naively hoping here might still brick the conscience this of some of these senators I mean it's so there are only\nIt only two senators who have indicated they might have a conscience on this and one Susan Collins came out before she even heard\nThe a review of the FBI's non investigation investigation said it was a thorough investigation thorough investigation that did not involve speaking with most of the witnesses and thorough investigation so call it didn't even involve speaking with Brett Kavanaugh this did not involve speaking with\nA Boise forward with that did not involve speaking with most of the cooperating witnesses and\nThen Susan Collins now having this ... allowing Susan Collins I assume to do which he always does which it sounded like a moderate and then vote the hard party line which he does over Ninety percent of the time and that's what you are unfortunately probably do again because Susan Collins has proven time and time and time again that she's got ...\nRight that's right there was one vote right on on the health care bill that you what the right way but I I agree\nYeah and yeah I like what you were saying that in a sense of hope for me as if that you would not like to see Brett Kavanaugh confirmed in that okay so maybe Susan Collins is satisfied with the FBI investigation and said may not have enough they're there to say that he's guilty of doing that but maybe he has the light on so many\nProvable small things that somebody's going to be like his character for a lifetime appointment does not fit to run their I ...\nI should probably over state she has on occasion rare occasion done the right thing by her constituents and the working people Maine but so often she has deserted their interest\nI Would like to know whether you actually think there's a possibility of a mind he was saying because I think are saying it was a thorough investigation when they didn't look into Brett Kavanaugh's drinking very much apparently and did not corroborate that he what you're saying that everyone knew he was eat had blacked out he had passed out he was\nA bad drunk and therefore he lied about this under oath as the Senate Judiciary committee\nThey don't seem to have gotten there although we the people may never know\nI I agree with you it looks I mean look you do a five day for day investigation or rush thing it's uh it seems like a pure fig leaf but I Do want to come back to this line this year I think that's the at the line and also\nThe the the bullying frankly that he did and that's why I think there's a Seventeen hundred and growing number of law professors who said he should not be confirmed even though they have different political leanings and different feelings about his sort of\nJudicial writings they feel like he just ... just a naked partisanship and a kind of a\nA a reveal the kind of emotional distemper that is not appropriate so who knows it's possible that they\nThat Murkowski and cones will say this is now going to go this is good at taint the Supreme Court forever if I were them on that side it's hard to imagine I could say look we're still going to get a conservative justice up quickly put in someone else hopefully a woman's there will be any of these issues likely\nAnd I'm Will still get that conservative justice but we don't white taint the whole Supreme Court with another person who has shown himself to be um really emotionally unstable for the court\nI think there's another part of that max which is that in that diatribe which he apologized and an editorial that he plays I think telling Lee in the wall Street Journal\nSpeaking to his ... I'm Brett Kavanaugh in that diatribe the opening statement that Brett Kavanaugh made he also was blatantly and overtly partisan blaming his problems on some Clinton led conspiracy\nAnd I mean that's pretty crazy stuff and then after you did say and I wrote all this myself subject to the lampoon him on Saturday Night live I can you imagine being in front of Brett Kavanaugh was some sort of campaign finance\nReform case are talking about how to have a level playing field and why\nThe Koch brothers shouldn't be able to buy elections when bedtime and there's already proclaim it's good that they should be able to violations in so many words I mean how can you have any confidence I mean they're ... they're going to vote their political ideology is going to do that anyway\nBut at least there should be some veneer of neutrality and a judicial judicial even handedness and he booth at a party blew it up at his own confirmation hearing and\nLook you could say this will taint the Supreme Court forever but Clarence Thomas has been there what twenty seven years now and\nShort and it has taken to the Supreme Court and that was that I I Do think that his presence I'm tempted and then the the more negatively parts of partisan because of positions of some of the some of the justice is not all of them but I think that's the day that I think it has less\nStanding in American Life that it wants to and this will certainly heard of this further\nI Do think that's right and I think that when you have analysis that Donald Trump not only controls the presidency and the entire executive branch and the legislative branch since the Republicans are\nAt their act lights and sink a fence and they'll do anything to make sure that someone on the right doesn't ... primary them which has now become a verb\nAnd then to add to that control of the judicial branch as well that is a recipe for authoritarianism I'm an optimistic note let's take a break and we'll be back on TALK messed a

WHM the news information and they are [noise]\nDavid is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you [noise] Saddam gray areas are wonderful thank\nYou you have a very generous relative what's going on\nUm yeah I've got a grandfather who over the years uh I remember as a Christmas gift to tribute it to my five\nTwenty nine planet um and now I'm at the point I'm a junior in college and uh but I'm also a full scholarship athletes at my university so\nI really needed to you this what do you do David\nI played football wow\nSo do you know what talent I have that I could do on any athletic field\nOr a no that's right because there isn't any [laughter]\nI'm impressed but you're good enough that you could get a a full ride athletic scholarship that's wonderful to hear thank you so um when there's a scholarship you're telling me that none of the five twenty nine money you had to use 'cause you're on a full free ride\nYes sir okay so your grand dad has some choices uh-huh first I should ask what are the odds that you're going to go to graduate school at some point after finishing undergraduate\nUm there's still a chance um I'd say it's probably less likely but there's still a chance I Would pursue graduate school\nReason that's my question is that then it's it's easy you they can't just sits there and then when you were to enroll in graduate school if you did then you're going to need to pull on the five twenty nine money and then or are you are available to you tax free\nRick cause you're a scholarship athlete there's this special provision in the five twenty nine rules that your grand dad can withdraw the money pay no ten percent penalty\nBut he would have to pay tax on all the earnings five twenty nine had\nOkay then it could be his money could because actually the owner of the five twenty nine account pulls without it it's their discretion what to do with money which comes to the next point are there any other grandkids who have yet to attend college\n[noise] um yeah I have three more younger siblings\nSo the best move by your grandfather is to change the beneficiary designation to one of your younger siblings it maintains the tax free status\nAnd then the money can be used for your siblings college and you get the full benefits so the earnings that have occurred over the years being spent tax free on school okay\nAnd so that would be in a case where you think grad school is not a big priority not likely moving the money to\nA younger sibling is the best okay great\nAnd congratulations on getting that toll free ride\nSite you very much alright

[laughter] ... houses recovery ban\nOn his recovery has been good I mean luckily he was on in his early mid twenties when an accident happens that he had years on his side um but that does\nNot add up he ended up having to for close to home um and\nIt it just it was a domino effect really so now we're we're doing better I mean as as far as our financial scale he started a a small telling company that he ... than I Am a hairstylist then\nI have excellent credit and we're really wanting to purchase a home you know practically next year maybe sometime in the near future so we just want to know what the best route is to go to help clean up his credit you know the week it's solid ate\nHis medical bills gee we work with the collection agencies I I just I'm not sure what the best course of action is\nHow many years ago was the motorcycle accident\nThe accident itself takes place in February she thousand eleven and a and from what I can tell going through his records on things went into collections and she thousand twelve eighty thousand thirteenth\nThere so the the items it actually goes from when the original debts were incurred but those debts\nStay with him for roughly two more\nYears okay they say in his life for seven years did anybody sue him and get a judgment against him for any of the medical debt\nNot that I'm aware of I haven't seen anything like that um I mean we do get notices from the collection agencies that I have not seen or heard anything about anyone feeling and\nSo the odds are probably likely that at this point he's outside of what some of the statute of limitations which means they are most states they wouldn't be able to sue him against any of those medical debt at this point\nBut as far as how they affect his credit with those outstanding collections on his credit truth is he can not qualify for a mortgage right now likely\nGotcha so we're going to talk options what are the odds that you with your great credit to qualify for a mortgage you have enough income you can qualify for a mortgage for the price point house you're interested in\nLast year my income with fairly low this here on business has been much better to me and so after I found my taxes next year to encounter this year will look good in my ... favor but I was pulled before when I looked in the past they they look at your last two years that your your income tax 'em\nTo determine what you qualify for it\nJust depends on the winter okay\nAnd you you are going to find that you're straight path to homeownership is going to be if you can qualify as the lone\nBorrower okay\nBut let's talk about him because his credit score number do you know what it is right now\nI just talked to yesterday and it's like a five thirty five\nGay and he's got to be in the six hundreds to be able to qualify even with the most lenient of lenders under the FAA loan program so the the\nThe foreclosures gonna hang there that's going to be there for seven years as a reflection on the credit but the medical bills are an interesting case because if he is able to pay the medical bills\nOr you reach a deal on those medical bills and then they report is zero balance under the newest of the credit scoring models the harm from those will disappear with the debts having been having gone from a balance to zero\nHow much in total are those medical bills that the collectors are after four\nAt this point what I've added up is about fifty four thousand which is a lot less than what he initially old and I don't know if that's because the collection agencies are settling for less\nUm I'm from the original ... bills that I thought it was over a hundred thousand a year now when I add them up if it's about fifty four thousand um which is still a lot of a lot of money um I just want to help him to start rebuilding his credit\nRight so if you want to help rebuild its a separate issue than the homeownership okay and that is for you to join a credit union if you've not done so already in a number of credit unions have something that goes into the generic term fresh start program\nWhere he can open a savings account the credit union and with that savings account and play some may require a CD instead of a savings account they always show them a low credit limit reserve MasterCard\nAnd at most credit unions they'll report that as any old credit card to the credit bureaus which will give him a straight line path to stab watching a good current\nPayment history with a credit card okay wonderful as far as\nMedical debts with them being that large yes but it really is something you're going to have to let the clock run\nThis should we just did not do anything about them at that point and let them but but then it just the way they are and eventually\n...

for an astronomer some of\nThe stronger me we were talking earlier in the show so I'm an about meteors and you talked about meteors that I think or comments not sure which and love to know the difference some that were in orbit around the sun\nAnd some that were just as I understand that passing by could you tell us which are which and why is why help\n[laughter] okay so ... asteroids are the big one asked asteroids somebody which are different than meteors on let's go through that okay so\nI mean when we talk about the solar system of course I mean son is that at the center of\nIt [laughter] I got that far I got [laughter]\nNo no no some people still have a like you know I think I may be able to say oh yeah yeah so so anyway so just to clarify that ah I think Kyrie Irving the drive through that oh you did about our stuff okay right so he had the problem with a with\nThe er I went to a meeting of flatter society wants how did that go it went\n[laughter] uh it\nWas interesting I'm never mind\nYeah no I I've been to Northampton or the we didn't go to the moon a conspiracy theory meeting as well you know a very exciting I anyway I Can't say anything\nMore about that okay music admitted his comments in Illinois so when we're talking about the solar system\nUsually a strong number is divided up as the uh inner solar system that has all the major a planet so again out up to a ... to\n... and then uh you have the outer solar system which is more like a icy or ... balls the IT balls of rocky I suppose how about whatever you want to call it that is where you have objects like Pluto now people are put those are in that context okay\nWell in in ... famous famous a statement regarding Voyager Voyager in fact took photographs of what looked like\nIcy rocks but our ... is a planet\nRight and and and right now as well I mean the you know if it's that that is in\nFact at the outer edge of the inner ...\nAt home right I'm into all I mean again there is no actual boundaries there is no border there is no sign of an answering the average guy or that the gun loses its influence of gravity way out of their way out for for for for Voyager we are still talking about\nA little bit inside of it and so those objects have called a trance Neptune or or object so basically they are often the orbit of\n... you just told this I thought that this new planet yes is circling will not circling that's all the wrong word but his is in an orbit around the sun and elliptical orbit and so\nBillions of\nMiles away and that is correct the sun is still exerting his gravitational force on this relatively small object right that is correct okay\nIt would keep on going into a gravity or all of the way out to a trillion a close to it for their minds as well but but we'll come back to it in a second okay right after the ... or ... what what people call find snapped him beyond Neptune czar but you have quite for about\nSo hyper belt is a place where you have a objects like Pluto as well do you have asteroids are in there as well and you have rocky ice ... around that park\nNow that are also object beyond quite profound and again there is no particular boundaries are which is called sort of like scattered desk a where objects have tilted orbits\nThis object that we are talking about for example a T. G. three eighty seven or ... the goblin I mean this is around that place now you also have beyond this scattered this beyond ... about\nYou have a big cloud a cloud doesn't mean you know cloudy but it means that there are billions of these icy balls which are a part of what the strong in what's called the or plowed this is a spherical your body the or all our T that'd be cool there or\nIf they had gone [laughter] so it is the or cloud which extends almost\nA light beer from our son so that is about a trillion kilometers are tend to including kilometers and\nSo we are still part of our solar it is still part of our solar system and that really extends way out and did it a question and of course we cannot see most of these objects in fact we don't see ... I mean pretty much none of these objects the ... the reason we know they exist\nIs big cause these bodies sometimes come in to the solar system goes to the ... and they appear to us as comments now that our comments that have come some come from the\n... area so does our short period comments like Haley's comment which comes every or whatever like you know a Seventy six years or so\nBut then you have these long period comments that come from way out and some of these comments without coming from the ... club we may see them come only once because their orbits maybe\n... years or maybe they are just coming in and then they go out of the solar system there are but it's such that they're no longer bound by it and they might just leave\nSo some comments are in orbit\nAround the sun in some configuration right\nI mean I was at all or comments are actually ... almost all but sometimes somebody skating right become this gave all of the ... so the question is yes okay so if I if I may\nAsk then we'll get to the [laughter] good good question why I'm\nComing to this one I mean if they are living out in the cloud I mean why why bother why why we have such a wonderful neighborhood and so over there and why do they have to come to our neighbors [laughter] well I mean so I think that\nMaybe equation with another a body or maybe some like you know some gravity or for maybe some other star or something like that an impact but there are bits get disturbed by something and and that gets them to come in towards the you know part of the solar system\nThis is related to ... and the reason I was a little bit hesitant because sometimes they do their orbit changes but it still remains within the gravity of the sun and their period is really long but occasionally\nThey orbit would be such that ah their speed is too much and then they escape from our solar system that can happen\nSo I'm a remedial question could you clarify clarify for me the difference between meteors in comments comets and asteroids\nYeah so comments are are icy bodies rocky icy bodies are uh whereas uh last rights are mostly rocks and so there is an asteroid belt\nThis is bill Newman's WHM\nAnd this in lieu of another named to replace your state you with max page is still your state you with professor and vice president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association max page\n... ... you know that when you keep those cards and letters coming into\nAny males max page I understand from your text this morning that you want to reveal that you in\nFact no one Brett Kavanaugh and had well a\nInteractions so share with us\nAll right well that's a little bit of exaggeration says what are the only ... but it's not a total lie it's pretty good for this confirmation yeah right [laughter] they were nice jeeze early on in the show\nHe was a year ahead of me in college and I knew in state far away from\nThe world of his super prep school beak\nBuddies but I knew that you ... ... yeah he was a year ahead and you know when I look at your book pictures of like the big fraternity was like oh I remember that guy remember that guy in it you know it all fits them a fully fully\nUm believe everything that the of Deborah Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford have been saying I mean there's a world there was a world of incredible\nPrivilege and I'm an enormous drinking in such a mystic behavior that one witnessed around a lot now I Know that happens a lot of colleges but there was a particular 'cause it's very very wealthy privileged jock\nCulture that he was clearly a part of\nThat's been part of Yale for as long as anyone I Believe that was George Bush's fraternity too at Yale\nThe that prep school Ivy League college continuum is something that is well not exactly a secret to those who were part of it and uh I don't know how John Kerry seemed to escape it but he did that\nSaid or did he we don't know well yeah ... and it was interesting when I was\nThere fraternities were really a very tiny part of social life but they were just beginning on the is that in fact there was a group in the ... my freshman year called the turkey defeat men's drinking club which became\nA revitalized I don't know if the states where that's where the other other fraternities or people went from there to SC or to de ... or like some of us became nerds and went to the library\n[laughter] you didn't get that prescription bones no ours these fraternities\nI mean I couldn't tell you if I did I Know what I did [laughter]\nBut those guys did it have been actually a number of them who do I remember seeing freshman year in this kind of nailed debauchery that went on to\nUm go bones and those other fraternities and then you become a Supreme Court justice war secretary of state\nI thought that the question about whether he had suffered a blackout actually was unfortunately not a good question because it's being asking was asking Kevin uh the impossible to know\nHow was he remember that's the whole point of a blackout you don't remember it including what you don't remember so\nThat kind of excessive drinking I take it was something that you saw from afar of course max page but something that was very real and everyone knew about it and or was part of our observed it or was affected\nBy any of us did it myself included but then there's a choice at which you which direction you go and whether you beat you you go all in in that kind of world and there was a there was a lot of that that that went on you know I I just feel like it in his\nCosts of admission you generally as I understand that for those really elites are drinking clubs you had to come from wealthy had to come from privilege yet to be a member of the country club you had to go to a prep school you had to really be ... and you know it's a public school nerd you know ... ... application not accepted for this crowded\nWell look I mean that that's what sort of studying ... to me I have a friend who was also my class one year younger than Brett Kavanaugh in his you know the Yale they called the colleges dormitories abrupt four hundred people\nHe didn't know him and he none of his friends my friends in my class in that college had no idea and other words they isolated themselves off they had they're kind of world in which they were they they found themselves\nTo me um there is that what my only hope still and maybe there's no hope left but I feel like\nThe level the free form lying on small issues and big issues might late I'm probably naively hoping here might still prick the conscience this of some of these senators\nI mean it's well there are only said only two senators who have indicated they might have a conscience on this\nAnd one Susan Collins came out before she did even heard\nThe a review of the FBI's non investigation investigation said it was a thorough investigation thorough investigation that did not involve\nSpeaking with most of the witnesses and thorough investigation so call it didn't even involves speaking with Brett Kavanaugh this did not involve speaking with a Boise Ford\nDid did not involve speaking with most of the corroborating witnesses and then Susan Collins now having this ... allowing Susan Collins I assume to do which he always does which it sounded like a moderate and then vote the hard party line which he does over Ninety percent of the time\nAnd that's what you will unfortunately probably do again because Susan Collins has proven time and time and time again that she's got ... right\nThat's right there was one vote right on on the health care bill that you what the right way but I I agree yeah\nAnd yeah I like what you were saying that in the sense of hope for me as if that you would not like to see Brett Kavanaugh confirmed in that okay so maybe Susan Collins is satisfied with the FBI investigation and I'd may not have enough they're there to say that he's guilty of doing this but maybe he has a light on so many\nProvable small things that somebody's going to be like his character for a lifetime appointment does not fit in there I ...\nI should probably overstated she has on occasion rare occasion done the right thing by her constituents and the working people of Maine but so often she has deserted their interest\nI Would like to know whether you actually think there's a possibility but Mondale was saying because I think are saying it was a thorough investigation when they didn't look into Brett Kavanaugh's drinking very much apparently and did not corroborate that he what you're saying that everyone knew he was he had black daddy it passed out he was\nA bad drunk and therefore he lied about this under oath as the Senate Judiciary committee\nThey don't seem to have gotten there although we the people may never know\nI I agree with you it look I mean look you do a five day for day investigation or rush thing it's a ... seems like a pure fig leaf but I Do want to come back to this lying a show and I think that's the at the line and also\nThe the the bullying frankly that he did that's why I think there's a Seventeen hundred and growing number of law professors who said he should not be confirmed even though they have different political leanings and different feelings about his sort of\nJudicial ratings they feel like he just displayed a just a naked partisanship in a kind of a\nA a reveal the kind of emotional distemper that is not appropriate to who knows it's possible that they\nThat Murkowski and cones will say this is not going to go this is good at taint the Supreme Court forever\nIf I were them on that side it's hard to imagine I could say look we're still going to get a conservative justice up quickly put it in someone else hopefully a woman's there will be any of these issues likely\nAnd I'm Will still get that conservative justice but we don't white taint the whole Supreme Court with another person who has shown himself to be um really emotionally unstable for the court\nI think there's another part of that max which is that in that diatribe which he apologized and an editorial that he plays I think telling Lee in the wall Street Journal\nSpeaking to his ... uh Brett Kavanaugh in that diatribe the opening statement that Brett Kavanaugh made he also was blatantly and overtly partisan blaming his problems\nOn some Clinton led conspiracy [noise]\nI mean that's pretty crazy stuff and then after you did say and I wrote all this myself subject to the lampoon him on Saturday Night live I can you imagine being in front of Brett Kavanaugh was some sort of campaign finance reform case are talking about how\nTo have a level playing field and why\nThe Koch brothers shouldn't be able to buy elections when Brett cabinet is already proclaim it's good that they should be able to ... in so many words I mean how can you have any confidence I mean\nThey're ... they're going to vote their political ideology is going to do that anyway but at least there should be some the nearer neutrality and a judicial judicial even handedness and heat booth at a party blew it up at his own confirmation hearing and\nLook you could say this will taint the Supreme Court forever but Clarence Thomas has been there what twenty seven years now and short and it has to take to the Supreme\nCourt and that was that I I Do think that his presence um take that and then the the more negatively part of the partisan because of positions of some of the some of the justice is not all of them but I think it has to be dated I think it has less standing in American lives at once that this will certainly heard it as further\nI Do think that's right and I think that when you have analysis that Donald Trump not only controls the presidency and the entire executive branch and the legislative branch since the Republicans are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "05"}
