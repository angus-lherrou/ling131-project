controlled by the Taliban now they see all the arguments coming out of the American government that are all basically trying to explain away the Taliban and its depending victory here\nAnd they understand that we're just desperate to get out so no I'm not surprised at all but I think the bottom line from my perspective is that people need to keep in mind\nJust how desperate this really is because there's a whole sorted long history here where the U.S government\nFailed um in just a complete a drum dramatically failed in what turned out to be a total fiasco and try and negotiate with top on the first time around\nAnd some of the same arguments all the same arguments that were made than are being made now and in fact it looks like we're having negotiation with them at the very same

Jimmy\nJohnson and the foundation for the defense of democracy is here and we're moving from Afghanistan's Somalia this segment of the national security report is brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world\nLeading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience\nTo the report on Somalia is dire the U.S has a hand in airstrikes and us long war journal keep a map of the airstrikes and the frequency of air strikes throughout the\nCoast of Somalia chiefly in the south\nYou have reported this past week the Shabaab is executing spies what do you do you measure the strength of Shabaab at this point and can you compare it to the Taliban\nWell you know that like like a tall bunch of Bob is principally an insurgency organization which is seeking to take over Somalia and parts of East Africa to build their own emirate their own Islamic state in East Africa and they're doing this under the banner of all kinds of the Shabaab is part of ... and has been part of a kind of force for very long time\nUm and so well kind of looks at this is the Shabaab is is designated as the organization or it's representative in East Africa to try and build an Islamic emirate there in the U.S is propping up the a nascent federal government in Somalia which has a lot of problems in his sort of very\nMuch an upstart effort is trying to prop up that that government at sort of a bulwark against Shabaab\nUnfortunately Shabaab still controls or contests a large portion of Somalia just as tall blond does in Afghanistan and chip Bob's roots are very much a local they have a lot of local strength there for a lot of tribal relations and\nOther parties that are sort of bought into Shabaab scheme in some areas and Somalia where Shabaab provides better governance on a daily basis um even though it's highly governance\nThan the actual government does and this is a big problem because what they're doing is they're trying to actually build the state slowly and so the U.S has expanded its air campaign against select individuals in Somalia the train weaken al Shabaab hierarchy and to try and take out certain operational commanders who are thought to be especially problematic over the last\nSince really early to thousands Seventeen there's been an uptick that my colleagues at long war Journal of and tracking in the number of American airstrikes in Somalia against these sort of\nA well defined targets um and you know these are the some of these airstrikes are course controversial and some of them are not really all that effective but um but they're the scare campaign has been going on for some months now and it's intensified for some months and it's still ongoing\nThe report you file is the execution of spies one of whom is linked to the U.S Abdul Aziz Abdul ... shake Hassan another link to and my six\nOr that or Wally ... Mohammed this begins to feel like the Cold War Tom the M. I. six and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S\nBritish Intelligence is small intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab\nEdge Bob like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign to take out certain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks and that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to do is tied this back to both the air campaign uh that we just were talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis isn't Shabaab Shabaab of course opposed the Islamic state just dissolve all kind of does and in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged by first authority\nThat's far Shabaab is is the far stronger ... player I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermine Islamic state\nIs accusing some of these spies including one in particular were allegedly worked for and my six of taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically a build up the Islamic State's presidents insurers strengthen it at your Bob's expense I think that that's probably more propaganda information warfare and their part\nTo try and undermined the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nSo we just have a minute and cheer knowledge is the U.S seeking to negotiate with Shabaab wastes negotiating with the Afghanistan Taliban\nYou know John that's a great point you know the top on what's happened with his negotiates with the U.S us the same as the tall bonds Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course it's all butter Maine's cool see out while I with all kinds of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ... is trying to build its Islamic emirate and of course the U.S not negotiating with\nThem and so we have two countries going in the same direction under al ... is a mantle and the U.S is negotiating with one part about kite as linked but not negotiating with the other part yes yes we can't rule it out in the future ...\nYeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point\nDoubt Shabaab would ever agree to any sort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have the substantial foreign right there and in Somalia that it doesn't have gas\nTom ... who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the

backdrop which we've talked about before is that\nThe June ... ... in his term is general secretary so we're now talking about six years\nHas really started to turn is back on on the things that may China's economy pop you know it's it's reform and opening up our are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down over there they're going back to state dominated markets\nAnd state determination of prices\nSo you know at this particular time um this looks really bad because it shows that um this is the way that ... thinks it's going to emit they might be able to do a little bit of short term getting through it by determining markets but they can't really have a long term solution here\nAnd you know you're absolutely right this is I think the inevitable result of communism see jumping is not an aberration he's the inevitable result of China's Communist system\nI'm going to use the chest metaphor I Am not a good player but I certainly know how to use the metaphor Gordon uh whenever the night moves on a board I've learned pay attention\nThe night in the hard to predict very dangerous piece when on the attack I read a report from Washington a pie by making a rare second trip this year to Vietnam defense secretary Jim Mattis is signaling how intense simply\nThe Trump Administration is trying to counter China's military assertiveness by cozying up to smaller nations in the region and share American wariness about Chinese intentions\nMadison is the night\nQueen ... court what's going on what is Vietnam how does this fit into the Chinese matrix\nYeah I mean it's as you say John I'm the United states is working with countries along China's periphery this really surprised me that you had as you say the second trip of mad as this year to Vietnam\nYou know one trip a year or one trip every three or four years on the part of the secretary of defense that would be normal two trips a in a year that's not normal and that's a real indication that the Trump Administration\nIs moving very actively to counter China and the Chinese have got to be really concerned because it's not only that we want to go to Vietnam is that the Vietnamese are accepting mad as they know that that's going to anger Beijing and they're doing it anyway\nAnd the Vietnam means do I remember correctly garden that they bloodied the Chinese knows one time once upon a time not too far and go\nWell it's not only one time not to Fargo which you're referring to Nineteen Seventy nine but you know throughout history the Vietnamese have been able to deal with the Chinese you know Joe in light the mouths of domes premier when he was talking to Henry Kissinger in Nineteen Seventy one or Nineteen Seventy two\nYou brought up just sort of out of the blue house the Vietnamese had really ... the Chinese two thousand years ago this is really on the minds of the Chinese that they just can't deal with Vietnam\nThat is called one other countries where do you think the defense secretary might be visiting in the near term\nWell you know I'm assuming that all the reporting that he is I'm about to be fired\nOr wrong and they probably are wrong you know you'd expect to see the secretary of defense go to the Philippines because that's the treaty ally\nAnd you'd expect him at some point to go to South Korea which is an unreliable treaty allies we've got some real military issues with the south Koreans who are taking down defenses without consulting us so you know\nThat should be on his ... though I don't know how whether he'll actually in fact go but you know you'll see a lot of senior administration officials around and I do hope Thaddeus that somebody of mad as his stature goes to Taiwan\nThat'll really tell the Chinese that the game for them is up they could not take

J. automated voice the great lakes are recovering politician and John Fund who's in Eastern Europe Budapest, Hungary\nA wonderful capital rescued once upon a time by the success of the Reagan Administration in the end of the Cold War and it's a pleasure to talk to Eastern Europe because ah Eastern Europe is\nProsperous an ambitious and growing and they have great food very good\nOf the Soviet Union exploited that food and now it's available for sale everywhere gentleman I turned to the midterms because I'll lose with Warren seems to have lost the argument she wants to talk about\nHer\nCreative heritage and Hillary Clinton seems to have lost the argument she wants to talk about her memory of Nineteen Ninety eight however in front of the Democrats is a challenge the economy is very good and pocketbook issues as my friend\nLarry Kudlow the director of the national economic council reminds everyone every time they listen pocketbook issues are what Americans vote on midterms presidential years off year ... we vote on the pocket book if it's good\nWe are grateful and we don't rock the boat if it's bad you bet we rock right now it's very very good so John\nDoe to you again on this ABC poll about sixty nine battleground districts these are the ones where the Democrats are ambitions to pick up seats against the Republicans because Mrs Clinton did very well in these districts in sixteen though they have a Republican\nCongressional member right now and what is the generic spread John and what does this tell you about this paradox of a good economy and democratic momentum\nWell I Would make an amendment to your statement the economy is good but Donald Trump is still a drag on Republicans or he has alienated a lot of suburban women having said that the ABC Washington Post poll I ... I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nUm the Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but on the sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans\nAre ahead by one point the Republican now other polls don't quite show that that they show\nThat the swing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes in districts they were going to win anyway so I think\nIn CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be two hundred making two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party whatever majority I think we're heading to a much closer house um result them people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat is you have an ... memory because you wrote through the tidal wave for the blue and two thousand insects and you also saw what a block Obama as a candidate he did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this is one poll I understand that it's a moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual facts at the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nMe as much better now than it was back in those six and a weight as opposed to fund can tell you and that made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand eight because we've already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house what about the Senate\n[noise] one of the senators very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by democratic for that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes a quarter you're FBI ... reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd game a clear advantage it can be more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court appointment next year\nMr fun the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up\nA it's a puzzle to me is is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\nWell remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognize uses liability on the campaign trail\nSaturdays they may real says you will know jobs when they get there and they started getting shall we say acclimated to their caucus those votes can change can say\nWell yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen the majority of the entire house\nI watch Tony clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the corresponding but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite he's quite clear about his accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job\nWell actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said I've interviewed the president three times as candidate is president elected and I was president\nThe the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic ah she says he's he seems to have grown into the job in the country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable and if\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of his fingers you and he's confident that's the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party that is\nMeant just got a counselor Mr fund that's the greatest thing I've heard the night of the country may not be comfortable with him as comfortable in the job [laughter]\nWhat what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging and the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of\nThe Republicans [noise]\nNo but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes\nHe's just going to remind voters over and over again that even though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys and by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton and given ... Kavanaugh given Michael ... you know the other team doesn't like it looked like professional paragon of governing hurt you\nKnow child if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my goodness\nWhat a ma law especially mentioning Ava ... who's now a\nWho's now a curse if he raise money for you everywhere he goes good heavens John fun he's in Budapest, Hungary the Democrats political science says gain the house that's going to happen or is it that is McCotter W.

going one on five ... champion [noise]\nFinally persecuted brand name persecuted Brunson and they Saudi let's put it this way they were in Ankara and Riyadh do not see the same book the same way let's put it that way and let All right I'll let me let me throw another one down here Iraq\nLast time I checked a and Ankara and Tehran and Moscow we're having a meeting about defeating oil sanctions and that seems to be relevant here how they're doing now\nWhile it is relevant all of these things are a ... and what's most important John is that everything is interrelated you cannot separate anymore any one of these\nIssues what we see Iran and Russia\nNow reaching a deal to circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports it they'll supply\nCrude oil Iran to to Russia to the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide we've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil and then going to to ... to um Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a it is Kuwaiti oil\nAnd the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month\nWhen put president a potent and Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran\nAnd the the the other sanctions the other um at this exposure about the efforts by Iran to ah to impose sanctions to to avoid the sanctions in the administration warn the world's banks\nThat they may try to use these duplicitous means to minimize the sanctions in panic and continue to fund terrorism and there's science that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data\nFrom September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they are using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India [noise] um\n[noise] to ah to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with the Iran central bank the shipping comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth\nSo it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export are now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that can of tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ... and the reality self that currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent and twenty Nineteen so Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant and the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nFatty American looking guys are ... recent reports show the Gazans believe the ... the bigger problem for us\nIt's exactly right and I think Palestinians over oil a blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than a blamed the um ah the Hamas for for\nWhat is happening and it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence and it shows that in the election or change\nGoing to bring about any ah any dramatic or a difference so we were seeing the um\nUh the the numbers that that came out that the more than almost fifty percent almost half a do not trust the PA they don't trust ... fairly but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority and\nThis is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects\nFor a changing things in in the um [noise] uh and the guy in gossip for instance because if forty three percent of Palestinians say the ... are responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed a Hamas\nAnd that that's why they don't want to demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative\nAnd they don't want the ... to take over and and especially don't like its measures against its own citizens\nThe fact that was another study that's coming out that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the Palestinian authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank so they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nIn Europe outcome I have learned because you've taught me\nThe Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here today\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone in all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it but you indicate there is there a change is there an enlightenment in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of uh the the tragedy of the twentieth century\n[noise] uh it's it's a that's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the that they pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister\nDid in in major European countries show a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround\nIn in Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania where in Romania to support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal uh it went to forty eight percent and and versus thirty percent were not supportive\nIn Spain it was forty percent Britain went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the court urban area or a rat and everything else and with all of the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns in Europe against Israel to see this a turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable I Will tell you some it is not something I Would have anticipated\nOr the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding\nOf the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes or did they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come to realize that you have one source of stability\nUm you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising about\nWe have a minute ... go ahead let's remember that the people of Europe are different than the elite that would gain to govern I'm correct\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and forget where it starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left right split that is exacerbating things may are also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn notwithstanding correct Malcolm that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and the very fact that that\nHe continues in the in the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to that\nYes our cousins in London you're aware of the fact that

Edmund Burke Edmund Burke is writing particularly in Seventeen Ninety and reflects\nAnd found the revolution in France in response to what he regards as an outbreak of kind of madness um that purport to have a better idea about how to achieve freedom\nAnd famously criticizing the French Revolution and reflection on the revolution friend Burke is thought is said to have laid the foundation for modern conservatism I think that's correct\nBut here we see a kind of puzzle\nBecause birth does not criticized the French Revolution because he's opposed the freedom to exit criticizes the French Revolution as a defender of freedom he says\nThe French revolutionary misunderstand them or a foundation to free them the purposes of freedom government's role and freedom Burke wants to set them great so in a sense\nThis fabulous as a kind of tradition within the modern tradition of freedom devoted to conserving our freedom\nAlmost all I should say that the dominance strands of modern

century and what that means to us today do understand our liberal is\nThe genius of our forebears\nTo give our freedoms that we take so much for granted we don't understand what where they come from or we don't worry about the fact that they could be taken from us now there is a word rights that is very attractive\nThe French Revolution used at the rights of man Tom tom Paine used it in is in his what you'd have to say very long pamphlet about the rights So Peter why did Edmund Burke the\nUh the parliamentary addressing parliament don't do this to the American revolution and don't mistake the American revolution for the French Revolution what did he make of these claims have rights in the French Revolution and elsewhere Peter\nUh he was appalled by their claims the price but this is Clinton needs to be emphasized not because he was opposed to the what he called the real rights than because he was opposed to the fake ones what were the fake ones\nBroad abstract claim a untethered to any historical experience with supposedly gave individual authority to protest to overturn any institution that this please them\nFor this for objective profoundly but he said the ... of the real rights of men I'm friendly the real rights of men are the ones that become\nThat get re frack that he writes the dense medium of politics\nThat are rooted in experience that are interpret that had been in this case interpreted by the British common law court for centuries and provide guidance for a living within political fight in a way that protects\nAll the more or less all the um [noise] uh all the good and the private sphere that John Locke would like to see protected but Burke is a Paul again appalled by the notion of rights that turns them into revolutionary called Joes\nFor um destroying all of them heritage political society\nLet's connected to the twenty first century now Peter because you also have a recommendation of what needs to be done our college campuses\nAre political parties and the television presentation of our most recent very unhappy advise and consent in the U.S Senate Judiciary panel have descended into these abstract false claims of rights that are pending as soon as we have people telling us what\nWe cannot say we have people chastising us for who we are for well how were born we have people right now so fearful that they whisper as if there were being overheard in our politicians\nI'd have to say at this point acting or they're pursued or under under assault there it's as if Washington is under siege what can be done how do we how do we start liberalism and at least in the conversation for the young people Peter\nWell the answer is no way a simple\nBut it oftentimes they for medical telling all the conduct that you've been describing guy or if flows almost directly from the kinds of the kind of education that uh we have been delivering students for more than two generations now it's it's an education that\nTrip from the curriculum including the curriculum of higher education any serious study of the American political tradition\nAny serious study of the principles of free speech and limited government any serious study of due process\nAnd and religious liberty it's an education that treats the American tradition as an almost I'm On the scene saga of discrimination against people on the basis of race\nOr sex or class\nAt it in other words it's an almost on he's in it that it's a false suffocation in that\nIt takes ugly aspects that indeed are part of our tradition and present so that's the whole truth and that excludes the glories shipments of the modern tradition of freedom\nSo that the long run it after the short at uh the short answer is that we must undertake a dramatic reform of our educational system so that once again\nWill produce students who leave our schools\nInformed about the American political tradition its strengths and weaknesses its costs and benefits\nAre and who understand the blessings they can they will receive by maintaining a the institutions of a free society\nAnd embrace liberal is not fish version called liberals but liberalism the idea that you don't you don't\nRetain you don't you don't protect your freedoms by by chastising others about their about their speech or their conduct that is not freedom that the French Revolution\nSo if you know from a

I I don't get your bits from my old neighborhood in Boston\nWhich is maybe what art should because I wasn't up at this at all the thing that really really really surprised\nAll ... was a high school class what am I ... a good kid to the guy football player and um he became homeless and I can remember when this happened in fact I just found out about the other night he was homeless and these pumps came by and dumped him with gasoline and set them on fire\nA nor is of course in Russia where ever made in this uh these people still walked the earth there were probably in business or maybe they own their own companies maybe they teach school whatever\nUm yeah no no no reserve and they know prostitution and stuff like that are probably a hundred people know about this okay you know who did it because uh anybody you are engaging the joy ride murders are always\nTalk but no prosecution here and ah you\nKnow maybe one of the movie reviews of groping and kissing somebody or something and then they'll lose their job but you know but\nBut killing a homeless guy killing a homeless guy us ... but a show anyway that was really surprising when that ... really good and um and they used to call them hog for some reason I don't know but uh yeah I remember a ... I'm One of the you know I Lived\nIn an area of ... in an era of bullies\nAnd there was so many of these guys who were were big tough cars like him who are not boys and so I was always a pleasure to guys okay but you're homeless guy s that's nothing [laughter]\nThat doesn't even count so they weren't even when he was ... probably wasn't even investigation they were it was a great time with us from you know I didn't think I was going to turn it had a great time there was supposed to be dancing but never really happy because people were talking too much and er yeah\nIt's like look I uh I think I think of a guy has won a hundred and eight games you kind of let him do whatever you want [laughter]\nUm but yeah I mean it it kind of the same thing happened\nIn the LDS um you know normally the rotation has been you know sale price and pour cello but it's been sale price in of all the because he's used for cello in relation yeah um so I don't think you'll see reports cello pitched tonight although you know who knows who knows some big big one big one today\nAnd speaking of tonight this is actually like a five o'clock game one of the game is that is that the type of graphical ... what is that\nI Know we don't get a we don't get the earlier ones very often yeah they've um um well you know the fact of the matter is the game the other game is out on the west coast ... do you know they want to do they want to show you both of them and um and so I think the second game starting at nine but no I'm all for the afternoon game either of\nYou know we don't have to stay up until eleven thirty minute I watch you\nKnow I mean I Can't even make it to the first or second any I mean that's as far as in fact you know lately I've only been tuning in because I Know why why am I going to torture myself or to win yeah the ... on it and um\nI watch the football game on Sunday chill halftime yeah and I thought I thought that game was all said and of course the the really good stuff came it yeah\nRight [laughter] oh what a game or to shoot out that was a lot of respect shown by the young guy from Kansas City ah Frederick owns\nA who takes on Tom Brady break up a better a ... down the stretch in fact I'm a ... got that dramatic a touchdown pass the ... and then everybody was happy because of your the scores so quickly that they that keep Brady enough time to march the team down for a few going to win the game ... exactly\nYeah but and I and Brady me very very generous to some homes to I guess after the game he ran right over to him you know I spoke with them you know you can imagine what he said you know keep up the good work it you know you're you know you're you're going in the right direction and you'll hear you know your tail come so I thought that was pretty classy and that's that's just the way\nThey talk about the new uh NFL and it looks like a lot of the announcers make appointed as Ryan Clarke has made a point of it several times and new NFL does this mean that this is like a college football like it's all off ... and no discernible defense is that what they mean by this new NFL [noise]\nUm I don't know what he meant when he said that\nBut um it's certainly um looked at the court like last night Aaron Rodgers had a huge game ... excuse me and I'm you know the guy I think the guys on the teams that can put points on the board do but you know if you go across\nThe all the box scores you know they're still you know Seventeen six games and I mean chimps used a waiting game seventeenth six and I think it was Seventy six in the second quarter and the patriots game yeah so you know the teams that can score to win the ones that can't do so I don't think things have changed all that much\nRight um my friend Rob Murphy or a big football fan they'll send me a text and ah he says American a very big thing of the patriots being twenty three and oh against quarterbacks under twenty five at home but he points out the Seventy and Fifteen against quarterbacks over twenty five at home so yeah that's\nIt's like I don't know who thought that that was in the series\nThat [laughter]\nKnow I think you are you are right I think they're they're they\nThey have a winning record because they want all those Super Bowl\nThe age of the quarterbacks their play doesn't see much of the Celtics open tomorrow night yeah they are calling this anyone out that way 'cause it it was that it's tonight tonight the Celtics\nAre they're calling this I mean this is so silly anyway but they're calling the Celtics team now the big five\nOr which is kind of refreshing because they always used to refer to teams as the big three you remember the ... with the ... from not too many years ago oh yeah I always thought that the they did feel five players at a time but anyway uh they're talking about the big five now uh this is a team that could go places no\nYeah it can and the fact that LeBron James is out of the eastern conference I think\nSo um yeah they you know um I mean we didn't get a chance to see Gordon Hayward clay last year because he got injured so I'm so early on a more you know the fact and so he's back and you know and and uh Kyrie Irving seems to have settled in now and and looks like he wants to be a Celtic for a while um\nSo uh I'm In it you know if that didn't happen in Hayward last year we you know we may not have found out a lot of the things that we did find out they have to readjust and play other players but yeah I'm I'm really looking forward to seeing just out that these guys can be 'cause that that's the upside is tremendous\nAnd the kid what oh can't remember his name either where's number zero to ... to God he uh I I think we are this team yeah no question\nAbout it and again because hey we're got hurt last year he ... he had to take on a much bigger role in his maturity I think you know he was pushed along yeah so and and you know and I and obviously pay it pay dividends last year and now he's you know he's not your you know your typical second year player\nWhat do you think of the coach ... it's I guess it's hard blood judges say\nYeah I mean you know jeez this guy's been a winner at every level and you know\nI just think it's really funny that he's you know he used this uh he's this unassuming you know unassuming white dude young guy looks like a kid you're you know out there and it's a yeah he's I I really really liked them a lot\nYeah I I I Do too I mean you know as you say what's not alert or the big five oh baby [laughter] I Know who's going to be I I don't recall anybody getting too excited about Celtics team this early in the season\nYou know well let's hope let's hope they are indeed the big five and not just the two and a half [laughter] long way to go between here and there\nSo I I thought it would be an early night for me to nice as the ... fire I'm gonna have to stay up all night to watch the cells to jeeze\nWhatsoever they on their own reply

I'm a position that was deemed to be a for a woman only because it dealt with dealing with prohibition which was regarded as a woman's issue so this was sort of a plum [noise] there was going to be

side for a book reading signing Q and a and discussion tomorrow evening Wednesday at seven o'clock\nThe game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight the game the game means the Harvard Yale game\n... as a conceit for a book and American in Nineteen sixty eight it strikes me that this is an oxymoron it in some ways it's a football game between two Ivy League schools not exactly football powerhouses\nAnd a time of tumult in America that was I think on President except maybe for the civil war\nAnd yet you managed to put these two very different pieces of the world together a football game between Ivy League schools\nIn America in crisis it works tell us why it works\nOr if I knew that um I'd be a rich man today because I could bottle that formula and sell it I you know when you describe it that way it's absolutely true midway through the writing of the book I thought what am I doing how am I hearing\nThis a game and that tumultuous time but I think I I came to feel that that game was\nUh like some kind of a miracle that took like like a flower blooming in a city sidewalk\nOr and so I wanted to contrast these sort of miraculous nature of that game which took place in a time of such vision or you know a black versus white men verses women are hard has for ... and so forth that the game itself seemed to just be something\nOf a miracle to me um and I wanted to find out who the players were that played in it and of course they were deeply involved in the events of Nineteen sixty eight\nTwo of the people who drive this story\nAre packed Conway yes and Calvin hell yes and those are names that some people will recognize particularly football fans will recognize Calvin Hill let's start with Calvin Hill because his story is fascinating and by the way\nWhen I was in the eighth grade and the Riverdale country school\nOut in the hell was the superstar athlete on the football team he was the football team you know I I didn't really know me was a senior\nBut he was a star there and then he's was it was announced he was going to go to Yale which seems someone like him because he could go to any football powerhouse school that he wanted but he went to Yale tell us about Calvin Hill because his story is indeed fascinating\nWell Calvin Hill or a grew up in Baltimore his father had been a share cropper on a farm in I Believe South Carolina\nAnd had a flat after fighting after getting into a fight with the boss a and a fled to Baltimore where he'd be where he worked in construction and\nUh Kelvin his father couldn't read or write until his wife taught him uh and uh but he decided that for his son his only child education was everything\nAnd she bought 'em an encyclopedia when Kelvin was only four or five and said son someday everything you want to know will be in these books when you learn to read anyway\nCalvin and won a scholarship to the Riverdale school which was a a um uh in in the in river in Riverdale section and the reason he ended up at Yale as you say he could have gone to any college in the country he was recruited by over eighty schools including some of the biggest football colleges in the country\nAnd he wanted it one day a he played a cookie on a day when he was supposed to go visiting schools\nUm and when he came back\nAh after having played hooky in in going out in New York has his coach said if you know you should look at Yale or his coach ... I'm Sorry not as coaches assistant coach said you should look at you\nAnd so ah he did and she wound up I'm watching the yelled Dartmouth game in the ... there were sixty thousand fans and Calvin thought I've always wanted to play at a school with a big uh a stadium but more importantly Yale had never had a black quarterback\nOr very few teams in the country had ever had a black quarterback the first starting quarterback in the NFL who was African American or would be in the fall of Nineteen sixty eight or and so\nCalvin Hill but I Want to be the first at Yale he'd been a quarterback at Riverdale one of the best quarterbacks in the country um so he considered going to Harvard but Harvard had been the first Ivy League school to have a African American quarterback Johnny McCluskey and sixty five ah in in the sixty four and two to five\nSo ... hill said I'm going to go to Yale and be the first African American quarterback he was moved to fall back two days in\nAnd never got to play quarterback never got yeah football I mean a quarter back at you\nWe are speaking with George how cold he is with lead based author his previous National Book award finalist book was the big house his new book is the game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he will be at the broad side tomorrow evening once said seven o'clock for book readings hunting to an a and discussion the another person another character plays a big part in this\nBook is passed Conway and pat Conway is a fascinating story and I'm Wondering if you might read a piece of it which I have marked starting a at the page where the marker is about past Conway who well you can tell a story but I think this paragraph tells\nConway left Harvard in January in Nineteen sixty six almost as many students supported the war as opposed it he had returned to a campus with a vast\nYou're already of students were passionately against it every bulletin board he passed was covered with anti war literature you could hardly walk through the square without being offered an anti ROTC manifesto\nWhen Conway cross the yard on his way to class he occasionally hurt students standing on the steps of widened her library railing against the war through bullhorn it angered him to hear them chanting ho ho Ho Chi Minh and they'll laugh is gonna win\nWell some of his buddies were still over there fighting\nIn his heart he believe that most of them were motivated not by idealism but by fear fear of going to Vietnam and getting shot at\nProve her innocence and exact prevent caught up in the Parisian world Vivian becomes romantically inclined with Henri Matisse but then her fiance returns with unclear motives\nBBN is arrested for murder author being Shapiro has made the historical art thriller her own in the collectors apprentice\nShe craft to hunting tale about the lengths people will go for their obsession with our money or vengeance\nJoin us at the odyssey bookshop self Hadley in welcoming ...

people who were excited about the iPhones or Sam's or they can't lay out a thousand bucks and they can't even handle two years of payments on a payment plan interest free which is still forty

service each month\nAnd so it means to step back and look at in spite of all the hype and all the ads and all that look at a more affordable phone we're going to use phones\n[noise] look at one of the

I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm gonna take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace to your advantage and with state school systems\nThis very somewhat state to state but more and more states are now going to three tier or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have what is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used interstate the flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier fourth tier is a community colleges many of which now offer four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYou're a freshman and sophomore year\nWill be in far larger classes than someone who goes to a fourth tier community college and the state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students or eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your pre wrecks as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six people were forty four people\nNot hundreds or thousands so you get a better deal and you get more attention from the instructor Chuck is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chuck\nLarge how's it going [laughter] not bad not bad at all how can I be of service to you\n[laughter] well over this the last six months maybe a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in\nBuying my house and um you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me look them up and see what they're all about but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so\nI guess my thought is I'm a they number ... number two um if they all legit today you know do a\nA low ball offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah too and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now\nOr education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead name who it is who is on your radar a comedy or is there any particular company\nThat you're curious about [noise]\nUm one of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are established ching in their racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could for to his mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory\nWhere they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home and so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOr so let's say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there\nAnd you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that is they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price house get it I'm dressed up however they need to in the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done\nYou don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay\nAnd you also have to decide the price that you were offered do you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nMm okay All right does that make sense\nYes yes it does yes I I just um you know wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nTotally legit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock answer with these companies\nThey're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country the developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh subdivisions and developments built with very similar\nHousing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there are in transition that maybe have been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that but it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi Clark how're you doing stuff no great thank you Tom how can I be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us will stay in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause it never hurts to have a backup car case you need it\nSo I I when I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better catch that wasn't the one I was using credit slave so nothing was going fine\nOne afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies than we've got your address change which obviously wasn't mine so I called them stop the stuff the card you know sent me an do in the whole smear\nAt that point I threw the cart into the to my file it started using my original heart again and at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the whole dance and they sent me a new card and then it happened again and October ... all three times as happened it's been a different a draft of a mail in the car too\nSo I talk to the company and they sent me on to the department that whole thing I did ask them I said no other cars I have off for a second level security where they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group or what was your elementary school\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not use that one [laughter]\nBut they said they'd offer they said that they they they gave me some language skills and say well people confessed that well maybe not but it's still said that level of security they should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the card issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections that a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out um exception to consumer protections for business cards\nSo as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successfully able\nTo take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well we don't think that you Tom took good precautions\nAnd so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business\nAt this club and nobody a gym be dot com [noise]\nStephanie Miller\nAs we mentioned earlier which you've seen some [noise] hopefully come up this whole thing\nThat I I've seen a clear

during the week do need to stay over at least a week or what about advance bookings those kinds of things\nRight so starting at the most fundamental airfares tend to be the cheapest each week on Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday afternoon after three o'clock so anytime on Tuesday or Wednesday and then again Saturday afternoon end of the evening\nAnd it's because of the patterns of when people\nFly now you have a lot of business travelers that fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but leisure travelers those are the quietest days for leisure travelers that's why on a Tuesday or Wednesday you have people on an airplane paying the absolute highest fares and people paying the lowest fares\nSaying over Saturday Night doesn't matter anymore what does matter a lot is how far in advance you by there been any of a number of attempts to figure out the ideal number of days before travel to buy a ticket for the lowest fare\nAnd I've never found one that truly convinces me but as a practical matter buying more than Twenty one days in advance\nIs a key trigger to you potentially getting a lower fare and I write for you when you're looking for a deal on a ticket to use to particular search tools to find the best deal one start a kayak dot com\nAnd put in where you're leaving from where you're going to if there's any airports nearby either your departure point or destination there would

getting a lot of different people and all different places saying a lot of different things\nAnd it's kind of confusing to try to figure out some sort of called up for some advice on what I should be looking for with a first credit card\nSo if you've never had a credit card and you don't have any history of the\nCar loans or personal loans or any loans at all is that right ...\nRight so you're starting from scratch you're going to have to do some heavy lifting to establish that first credit and it it's more work than it should have to be but if you it's one of those things if you don't have history how do you get history\nThe way you do it is you need to either go my first preferred choice is to go to a credit union are you a member of a credit union yet\nI'm I Am not but there are several in my area that I could go at\n'cause a number of credit unions have what are known generally under it's not a trade name it's kind of the general category we're known as fresh start programs\nWhere you can establish an account a membership with a credit union and what they do with those programs as she put money on deposit with the credit union in a credit union CD or savings account and then that establishes your eligibility for a visa and MasterCard\nAnd the limit on how hard is somehow loosely tied into what you put on deposit in savings or in a CD\nAnd then they'll have like a a schedule that if you pay the bill one time month after month they gradually move you from having to have that CD or savings account to just having\nA credit card with no restrictions the advantage of the fresh start programs at a credit union versus what you might have heard from people about secured cards they might mention is Hillary card to you\nI have heard about this yes\nRight so the difference is the credit union cards generally are not considered to be secured cards they're just a regular events or MasterCard but the credit union is protected by the money you have on deposit with them as a member\nA security guard secured cars are issued by banks have various sizes and with the security card you specifically give them money did is equal to the credit limit they're willing to grant you and they have possession of your money\nAs a security deposit if you will like you would have if you went to rent an apartment and then ending on the secure card after twelve or Eighteen months of on time payments they then transition you to a regular credit card\nOkay problem with the security card programs is they have\nUsually very high annual fees and you've got the time period you have to wait and usually the way they're reporting the car to credit bureaus is under a status that lets the credit bureaus know that it's a secured card and not a full repeal these or MasterCard\nOkay yeah my bank tried to get me to sign up for one of those but I did see that it had quite a high interest rates I was sort of shy away from them\nSo this is one of those areas where if you find a credit union that has one of these\nIt's a vastly superior way to establish your first credit\nOkay fresh our program at the cutting in and I will definitely look into that thank you\nYeah there's one other option I'll mention just briefly and that is if you have a family member who's willing to add you to their credit card account mhm and that would give you the ability\nTo establish credit in the fastest way possible\nAnd depending on the issue or a credit card some will only extend you as soon as an authorized user others will make you a co owner\nCo owner status is what's really best for you and it would allow you immediately to establish your credit record in credit history with a major credit card your family member can sign you up for it but then not give you possession of the car so they don't have to worry about well what you might do with the card\nBut any of the methods will get you pretty quickly to where you have that establish credit history and then after that it's just after you how you handle it\nDaniel with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel\nHey what Daniel you have a one year old boy or girl girl she turned one years old

I'm just wondering a is a five twenty nine plan right for us\nAnd if so which worn 'cause I don't see my own state listed on you're you're a best buy twenty nine plans\nYou're a Floridian that's correct so Florida does a different form of a five what comes under the five twenty nine code Florida has a prepaid tuition plant ... and so you've got Seventeen years to totally brainwash willow\nThat the only school she's going to go to is a Florida State school okay now what are the odds though that Seventeen years from now you won't have long moved to who knows where else in America\nProbably very slow and we've got a lot of family here saw probably stay in this area\nSo if you're going to stay in Florida we do have the alternative 'cause a five twenty nine college savings plan is basically a tax free way to put money aside for college and it can be used at any a real college for even colleges overseas\nAnd can be used for any eligible college expense so well I Would have enormous flexibility where to go to school\nOn the other hand if you ... it's an open question how much a school where you're going to be able to cover with the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nYou will be able to buy the centrally course credits and avoid what inflation will do the cost over the next Seventeen years\nSo it's there to entirely different ways to attack college costs\nAnd so you're okay you really need to think through\nOr you are you comfortable for willow\nSaying hey you got to go to any college as long as it's a state school in the state of Florida period and if you are then you should probably you look at doing the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nAnd that's because the law for the way to gauge where he\nWrites you'll you'll know we've lost that is as much of willows education\nOkay one more faith in the next life works at a local college here in the state of Florida and she gets I guess for torture for spouses who and that and all that\nAssuming she's staying there Seventeen years from now so I guess that's kind of an option as well so if I did before the curry paid off on twenty nine point how would it be if I was trying to get my money back because\nI see what happens with a traditional five twenty nine plan if a child scholarships out\nThe ten percent penalty they would normally\nAffect you with a five twenty nine plan not used for colleges waved\nBut you have to pay taxes on any earnings but you know uh considering we're education's going let's say well oh your wife still working there well goes there gets the free undergraduate degree\nSuch a big number of students now go on to some form of graduate school\nWill do it and the five twenty nine point money would easily be used for graduate school\nOkay well ...\nSo that is an unusual twist you brought to the table there\n[laughter] oh it's assuming that my wife will be there for yourself or\n\nImagine working hard for so many years and reaching your retirement only to find out there's an issue with your pension or four one K. unfortunately it's a problem too many Americans face a looming pension assistance project hope you get the benefits you bird by providing free legal help contact with pension assistance project at eight eighty four to\nFive six oh six seven or visit them online and mentioned held dot org slash New England a public service from the U.S administration on aging pension counseling and information program\nDo what do you make you reveal what are you are as I say to Turner's false nobody a gym\nCBS News on the hour with Jeff glory presented by Sarah works relief\nTuesday Afternoon still looking for answers that is the bottom line across the international community into the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jim ...

Fifteen Years and I listen to all the applied cast so I have heard you many kinds recommend shopping or homeowners in auto insurance carrier because so many insurance companies penalize loyalty instead of rewarding at\n'em but you also recommend getting insurance from a company that gets high ratings for customers satisfaction and I'm currently getting my insurance through one of those companies\nHave mentioned regular even with Mika oh man\nThat is that is a real dilemma for the ... if you're with a ... mutual or usa who are the two of wheat insurers for auto and homeowners in the United states he so there was a study recently that found that\nWhat you pay with both of them is actually generally favorable to that because they are there for the policy holders is mutual the premiums are reasonable but the best part is here with the best company\nAnd so it's possible you could shop and you might find a premium lower somewhere in America but would that be a smart move I Would say if you can afford the premiums this would be an exception to my shopping rule for auto when homeowners\nGreat that's what I wanted to make sure I can just stay with and they\nCame out many times have you had over the years I'm just curious\nOh not so you don't even know if they're great guys\nI get I get great customer service from them and I really like working with them\nAnd I you know I Do want to make sure that I have a great company because there's always the possibility that I'd ... file a claim\nLater I I ... drive on Montana relatives which I knew\nSome of the Montana

you're going to sign up for take a picture of that benefits page\nWith your phone and there'll be stored in your Google Photos and you can file it away and your documents area and then if you're ever wondering hey my card to have a benefit for this that or the other and you'll be able to work there and see\nWhat pretty much might be a way to save you some money but remember with the changes going on if you've got a card a while back make sure that particular benefit still applies with that particular cart\nDrew is with us on the Clark Howard show high drew\n... how are you doing I'm doing pretty good today\nDrew you have a friend who's trying to get too involved in something\nYes and they have an afternoon for quite a while now managed to evade and [laughter] oh\nSo you're adding you a pitch how you're going to get rich if you joined him in some kind of multi level or something\nThat only a multi level marketing thing itself is she I don't really know exactly what they sell\nOkay let me stop you right there drew\nYou don't need to proceed any further because if you're just looking for me to tell you things you can tell your friends say your friend they'll go away I'll do that but you know when somebody is even considering a multi level\nIf you don't want to do it [laughter] you don't want to do this at all [laughter] fat off of a reason because LA you're talking about something that your friend drives you crazy talking about it all the time right 'cause I fair\nOr for a little awkward because I Know it's on his line and I'm not really able I asked during the war\nI don't know I Want to be supportive of them but I also want to know more about\nThis okay so this one is like many others right now that promises cash they must be Fifteen or twenty of these right now that promise that you can get discounts on a variety of services that many of us already use that's right\nAnd so they say you know instead of you just paying for these why don't you get a discount getting um for me and why don't you offer to other people that they'll get discounts buying 'em from you and then everybody's happy 'cause everybody's paying less\nThen you get extra income how am I doing was either they're through when he has given one of the best right yeah that sounds about right okay so the real story\nIs that you will not necessarily save money\nWith any of these multi level things 'cause there's so many commissions have to be paid and so much administrative work this civil that by the time somebody buys a service and all the commissions are paid and all that the odds that there's any money they've saved\nIs so low that it's really a lot of sound and fury signify a waste of your time\nNow you're talking about a signing up some of my utilities would fail or yes in and out of also join it because I like to join in this thing you've got to Italy and getting them by fire way and you write for like\nFive or six hundred dollar right and then he gets ...\nYou're going to get to that but I Will if you'd like I didn't want to say something this guy who's who's a friend but not a close when the ... person somebody who's not even a a non close friend that he\nDon't want to do that yeah so what happens is if you pay the\nEntry fee that sweat generates a lot of income for your friends\nAnd for the ones that are further up the\n... so it is you find your way into\nA organization that is not as best I can tell none of these utility kinda ones are scams\nIt's just I Can't see where anybody actually makes any money off marketing the utilities and people buying those services from them that the money is made from recruiting people end of the organization\nDrew my belief is the only people should get involved in a multi level or people who will go well outside their circle and chat this up to strangers and they're always thinking about it they're always trying to sell\nI think you just keep it simple say I'm just not a sales kind of guy\nThis wouldn't work for me and make it about you not about him you know like when people break up with each other and say it's not about us about me that's how I'd handle it with him\nAnd maybe that will make it a less tense and uncomfortable when the two of you are around that there is no not to try to pitch it to you Gloria is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Gloria\nHow are you I'm just fine Korea you have a question for me about banks versus credit unions is that true\nYeah that's correct I was considering leaving my bank and um I had a thought there was one vantage kept going to a credit in all and that's what I Want to find out\nWell first of all asking me that question isn't fair\nBecause my answer is going to be nearly a hundred percent of the time a credit union\nAnd the reason that I say that is that at a credit union you own the place so the culture is set up in less it's a dysfunctional credit union the culture is set up to serve you the member\nAnd so most credit unions offer free checking where most banks no longer offer free checking\nAnd interest rates on savings\nAre generally higher at a credit union than they are the bank and then in turn interest rates on loans if you do borrow from a credit union the interest rates on many things like car loans or half the interest rate of what you pay on average for a car loan at a bank\nSo my next question will kill I have to be a member of the like do I have to be a teacher to teach his credit union or a any other discipline\nThat is a wonderful question and there was a walk change up a little bit more than Fifteen Years ago that made credit union membership much more available\nAnd there are a small number of credit unions that remain that are as you describe that they're only for people who work for a certain company or have a certain type of job\nBut that's very rare now most credit unions in a local area are available to anyone in that local area\nHow would I find that out from just call them and ask\nA yeah I mean how many credit unions in your area do you routinely pass every day five ion\nYeah probably about ...\nOh okay see a you know just make a mental note of the names of them and just call up and are you more interested and better deals on loans are better deals on savings and checking\nSavings in chapel okay that the reason I ask you that question\nIs their credit unions that have a savers culture and there are credit unions have borrowers culture and a savers culture credit union will offer more generous interest rates to people in savings and CDs\nBut then in turn not offer the absolute rock bottom race on loans because they're paying a little bit higher interest rates on savings\nAnd then there are others that are borrowers credit unions that everything's about giving really cheap interest rates on loans\nSo the race they pay savers and an CDs are not as good so when you talk to people if the rates on simple savings are important to your money market accounts and I asked the person you talk to on the phone what are the rates you\nPay currently okay and that would be for you\nProbably the easiest way to comparison shop which credit union you'd go to\nOkay great

sixty eight he'll be at the broad side for a book reading signing Q and a and discussion tomorrow evening Wednesday at seven o'clock\nThe game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight the game the game means the Harvard Yale game\n... as a conceit for a book and American in Nineteen sixty eight it strikes me that\nThis is an oxymoron it in some ways it's a football game between two Ivy League schools not exactly football powerhouses and a time of tumult in America that was I think on President except maybe for the civil war\nAnd yet you managed to put these two very different pieces of the world together a football game between Ivy League schools\nIn America in crisis it works tell us why it works\nOr if I knew that um I'd be a rich man today because I could bottle that formula and sell it and I you know when you describe it that way it's absolutely true midway through the writing of the book I thought what am I doing how am I hearing\nThis a game and that tumultuous time but I think I I came to feel that that game was\nUh like some kind of miracle that took ... like a flower blooming in a city sidewalk\nOr and so I wanted to contrast these sort of miraculous nature of that game which took place in a time of such division a you know a black versus white men verses women are hard hats resist hippies and so forth that the game itself seemed to just be something\nOf a miracle to me um and I wanted to find out who the players were that played in it and of course they were deeply involved in the events of Nineteen sixty eight\nTwo of the people who drive this story are packed Conway yes and Calvin ... yes and those are names that some people will recognize particularly football fans will recognize Calvin Hill\nLet's start with Calvin Hill because his story is fascinating and by the way\nWhen I was in the eighth grade and the Riverdale country school\nOut in the hell was the superstar athlete on the football team he was the football team you know I I didn't really know me was a senior\nBut he was a star there and then he's was it was announced he was going to go to jail which seems someone like him because he could go to any football powerhouse school that he wanted but he went to Yale tell us a bit about Calvin hell because his story is indeed fasten it\nWill Calvin Hill or a grew up in Baltimore his father had been a share cropper on a farm in I Believe South Carolina\nAnd had a sled after fighting after getting into a fight with the boss a and a flood to Baltimore where he'd be where he worked in construction and\nA Kevin his father couldn't read or write until his wife taught him uh and uh but he decided that for his son his only child education was everything\nAnd he bought 'em an encyclopedia when Kelvin was only four or five\nAnd said son someday everything you want to know will be in these books when you learn to read anyway\nCalvin won a scholarship to the Riverdale school which was a um uh in in the ... river in Riverdale section and the reason he ended up at Yale as you say he could have gone to any college in the country he was recruited by over eighty schools including some of the biggest football colleges in the country\nAnd he wanted it one day a he played a cookie on a day when he was supposed to go visiting schools\nUm and when he came back a after having played hooky in and going out in New York is his coach at it you know you should look at Yale or his coach ... I'm Sorry not as coaches assistant coach said you should look at you\nAnd so ah he did and he wound up I'm watching the yelled darkness game and the ... there were sixty thousand fans\nAnd Calvin thought I've always wanted to play at a school with a big uh a stadium but more importantly Yale had never had a black quarterback or very few teams in the country had ever had a black quarterback the first starting quarterback in the NFL who was African American\nOr would be in the fall of Nineteen sixty eight or and so\nCalvin Hill but I Want to be the first at Yale he'd been a quarterback at Riverdale one of the best quarterback in the country\nUm so he considered going to Harvard but Harvard had been the first Ivy League school to have a African American quarterback Johnny McCluskey and sixty five in in the six\nAnd I'm going to go to Yale and be the first African American quarterback he was moved to fall back two days and\nAnd never got to play quarterback never got yeah football I mean a quarterback you we are speaking with George how cold ... is with lead based author his previous National Book award finalist book is the big house his new book is the game Harvard Yale and America in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he will be at the broadside tomorrow evening once it's seven o'clock for book readings hunting Q and a\nAnd discussion the another person another character plays a big part in this book is passed Conway and pat Conway is a fascinating story and I'm Wondering if you might read a piece of it which I have more starting\nA that's a page where the marker is about\nPast Conway who well you can tell a story but I think this paragraph tells\nWhen Conway left Harvard in January of Nineteen sixty six almost as many students supported the war as opposed it you'd returned to a campus where the vast majority of students were passionately against it every bulletin board he passed was covered with anti war literature\nYou could hardly walk through the square without being offered an anti ROTC manifesto\nWhen Conway cross the yard on his way to class you occasionally hurt students standing on the steps of widened her library railing against the war through bullhorn it angered him to hear them chanting ho ho Ho Chi Minh and they'll laugh is gonna win\nWell some of his buddies were still over there fighting in his heart he believes that most of them were motivated not by idealism but by fear fear of going to Vietnam and getting shot at\nLook for the bright yellow local hero label to think about becoming a CSA supporter go to buy local food out of work do you find out what she does and why it's worth supporting and blown out of the team\n[noise]\nThis is bill Newman WHM [noise]\n... or a monthly comedy quiz\nLet me turn the microphones over to our comedians are standup people take it away please\nThank you and people get confused AR you stand up people\nYet they end up you know you may be having to do ... we are currently sitting improvise were had it all you hear somebody thanks for Asia you're already isn't the dart hello everybody\nI'm Laura Patrick of the ... group and I'm excited to be hosting this month comedy quiz show in the comedy quiz a couple of comedians and wasn't smart person will attempt to answer questions from our quiz master testing them on their knowledge of the world you can imagine how that will go\nAre funny people today are me Laura Patrick and Pam Victor and are smart person is WHM peas montebello Monti thanks for joining us I think of myself as money rather than smart but okay well we all had a dream resident company excluded I mean you are you are\nPam Victor is president and founder of happier valley comedy which recently opened a brand new comedy theater on route nine in Hadley\nHappier valley comedy offers regular comedy shows a comedy school and the through laughter professional development program which uses improv to improve communication and collaboration and creativity in the workplace more about happier valley comedy at W.

... that was my mother are we going to have to bring her over heated late Dr clients going to ask a question and ... are going to call out our name and try to answer correctly for one point bill Newman's going to keep score fairly but creatively you\nIt's a highly scientific computerized method that it was reduced to other them out some algorithm yeah algorithm algorithm Newman will keep score points with less ran do comment\nNeal bill Newman's I'll go\nOh man I Will be like one of the jokes or if there is no prize we're just trying to write a letter to this micro first\nQuestion please this is going to be the true or false questions Michael Dr Klein minutes or Michael technically Michael please do just common my will ask a question we will call at our names that tried to get a point first question on Sigmund Freud\nFirst question and Sigmund Freud is Freud is credited with saving sometimes the dream is just a dream true or false\n... de Monte go go ahead true I'm gonna say false because I think it's more phallic and its actual quote Mm oh a cigar is just a cigar or I I I I have no opinion I have no opinion\nOn that when they come on and they have is a yeah there's no no no no she's ... she's halfway to half a point okay let you go ... is the answer\nIs false them out of a trick question because people do think Freud actually said sometimes the cigars just a cigar but even that is not true\nNo mindset why our okay nor did he say to save ... ... feet somebody else said that [laughter] an artist said that OK champ gets a I think maybe lose the half a point for the French\nWhat all of a sudden voting franchise or didn't even fresh air and you get there right once you get my only got a point on that he got to write small yeah\nYou get points for me I got it wrong twice All right All right All right\nIt's got to go down as mine is a half so you go to a second true or false question on Sigmund Freud\nThe definition of a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but you in fact I mean to say your mother I mean another Laura [laughter]\nFalse they forget slip actually has to do with the deep psychological sub meaning subtext\nWhat he just said true I'm also going with\nTrue it is in fact true I messed up with my attempt at humor there Floyd apparently did say that almost invariably he discovers a disturbing influence from something outside of the intended speech to cause this slip the disturbing element is a single unconscious thought which comes to light through a special blunder Abou\n... under under ... fall it [laughter] and it's\nLike a oh it does feel Judy I didn't know Freud had ...\nAnd all the time I thought it was something you were under address you know what other friday and slept All right I think we should move on to multiple choice yeah section is if someone with that I Am and I both in got they both got it\nAnd by the way I don't know for the first point if you want to give Laura some sort of reward for not trying either true\nAt all [laughter] pays a notch right now I took ... minutes well gee I thought it would have ...\nChance but I guess if you say neither than it was that I Would\nWalk in the path of mediocrity I wrote down in the middle of it will give her another half a point oh eight um what is the score right now bill or two to one to a half she didn't want to have a baby and gives him or her home has a point for the right answer but she wants to have for the for the French okay All right as well\nSo we'll go on to our next a\nNext a section of question wages any meaning mining
