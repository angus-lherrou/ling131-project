S. M. C. A. news lives and here we are in the fourth quarter\nThere's a lot of consumption going on in the United states\nI have not heard anything about is slowing momentum if anything I've seen house prices maintain their high\nMaybe there's a shortage and supply at the starting um have you heard any interruption and the shopping or in the consumer confidence lose\nNo I I think you're looking at a spending being very strong in the third quarter and what everything I raised suggests it's going to be very strong as well in the fourth quarter we're talking about growth three and a half percent kind of territory a look when you have the federal\nReserve chair a Jeremy Powell talking about the U.S economy being almost too good to be true and talking about how there's not going to be any recession until twenty twenty uh you know that's a that's a pretty good indicator and I don't think he is someone who is political\nI don't think he's saying it uh except that is what he sees a and that's in spite of\nThe fact that the fed is going to be a increasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so right now um I don't see in the\nMarketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of dead around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever people borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever uh and that has had some impact probably on\nStock prices but it also has meant that interest or that the debt levels have gone up but it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew something was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street is being a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas season I've not seen a negative report on that in fact what I have seen is shortage of workers to stuff up the retail\nWell that's right in fact all the retail uh\nCompanies are out there raising at Amazon today announced that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour for all their employees others have raised wages to make sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers but the increase year over year target I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that\nThat that suggests that they're looking at they credibly good indicators are\nFor the cause of upcoming holiday season and don't forget for many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate\nRight well for Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be I'm completely indifferent to the idea that Democrats could raise their taxes or at least roll back the tax cuts that it came through early in this administration\nUh people are saying there are other big concern is health care and I would say they're a Donald Trump talked about that today in his meeting with the electric or his speech to the electrical workers group a ... and talking about\nHow the Republicans have done such a great job on health care rates are going to go up next year they really if if if that is true they need to really broadcast that because boy that's not the perception\nYeah this last

so called joint ventures which are in most cases provides them with fifty one hundred and fifty three fifty five percent ownership us as a minority stake holders why there is a huge problem\nFor the simple reason that the Chinese owners can command the American business people to literally lay down their blue print on the desk\nAnd from there the technology opens up and that's how they do the stealing and that's ... the force a turnover of technology that is in and said the essence now they've had some very tiny false starts with it give some small financial companies ownership but guess what they will not grant a license\nThey will not but I had a wonderful conversation with the president of cool late last week right because they have been some issues you know are you being fair to conservatives and so forth and we talked about the world situation Google with lots of open up and try and again you know they walked out years because censorship\nBut he's running up against St problem\nThere's no ownership or are they can't get a license and they're nowhere near a deal that Google\nAnd just multiply that by whatever six folder tenfold at twenty four so the ownership issue

Charlie is the last train from Hiroshima, Hiroshima the story of the double survivors of the atomic bomb attacks in Nineteen forty five however this new collection\nIdentifies to novelists to storytellers\nWho wrote long before Nineteen forty five or something that we can now recognized in their story resembles the metaphorical way of describing atomic weapons in one case\nUsing the word atomic itself Charlie a very good evening to you we have no explanation for this and you don't try to uh to rationalize how it is that a man named Morgan Robertson\nA published a book beyond the spectrum anticipating the war between the United states and Japan who was he and what is the story that he tells in the original publication I Believe Ninety eight grade\nIt was a writer why at the time\nOr cold penny dreadful in late Eighteen Ninety eight he wrote a novel about a land take steam ships are filled with famous people that on a cold April night struck an iceberg and say the ship was\nBasically the same construction is the Titanic even pick the month of the year right and by the strangest of all when sitting says\nHe wrote this novel a science fiction novel about a futuristic ship that he had actually named the ship the tight\nSo fourteen years before it happened he writes right of what that we now remember as\nA the longest along on the night to remember but I Want to get to the Japanese part because All right he's got credentials he imagines Titanic fourteen years early but in Nineteen away he imagined the second war what were the terms\nHe story or this or is it this was a two volumes set\nA cold beyond the spectrum the war ends with a bomb that produces a crate slash he calls it the sun bomb the Japanese call it the sun bomb and beyond the spectrum seems to refer to raise a light that are beyond the visible spectrum\nWhich happened with the Hiroshima bomb the ultraviolet the microwaves the gamma rays the neutron spray that you had an era she\nWhite ... started the war for Morgan Robertson right this is Nineteen away what started the war and the way that led to the sun by what how does it begin he\nHe writes that bear\nA he even wrote a bat the Japanese internment camps in America of Japanese Americans are herded into these camps the war it becomes a war that\nUh takes place in the air they were flying for traces a silvery planes and battles fought\nWith submarines and everything futuristic machines that did not exist in Nineteen oh wait the Wright brothers have only just flown and war begins with an air and naval attack on Hawaii and on ... on December morning\nNice you know a ... just right now beyond the spectrum Morgan Robertson published an IT no way you have the book it exists here he begins the war in December an air and sea attack on Hawaii the the us naval base in Hawaii\nThe cause that causes ... is that the U.S has imprisoned Japanese are Japanese Americans\nThat that drives the Japanese attack it leads to a catastrophe and the destruction of Japan when the sun bomb is that what happens in the end\nRight and America is spurred on to a ... do mechanized warfare and industry that connects stripped Japan so the war ends because more and more of these bombs would be produced there's even a point in the war where\nA sister ship or the titan from his earlier novel is described with its stern rising into the air and glittering daylight ah and\nAs it goes under a after having been taught P. toad or mind and he named that ship the gigantic\nWhich believe it or not was actually the name they were going to give to the Titanic sister ship before the Titanic sink and they renamed that ship state Britannica which actually ... Morgan Robertson described\nAlright some Morgan Robertson is from another galaxy and he prayed\nMaritime coincidence right as we can light light ... look like an amateur right\nAnd I'm Glad he's not writing novels right now now we moved to the other famous much more famous novelist H. G. wells the world set free what does that\nThat is a novel that he\nWrote published in Nineteen fourteen\nAnd he describes the atomic bomb and he describes in element very much like plutonium instead of naming it after Roman God of the underworld or death he named it after one of his or girlfriends\nOr Carolinian but basically it describes plutonium he calls it the atomic bomb and it's a war that a leading up to nuclear war\nThe reason the word atomic bomb the term atomic bomb enters into the into the vocabulary is because two very famous censuses to been transported to America we'll sell art and a Enrico found me one of them is read the novel which one\nUh that was ... he read it and then while crossing the street one day he was looking at a stop light and then thinking about the novel and that started and analogies going which are then he got\nIn contact with Feinstein and they wrote that famous letter to FDR a lot also knew that the Germans were or are starting to work on air to build a\nNuclear reactor and uh basically ... novel the world\nSet free is what started this whole ball rolling\nAnd so the term atomic bomb is from H. G. wells and write invented it and the Japanese more on the United states we don't believe that the amber or ... or the military tribunal hadn't read beyond the spectrum before the war and we don't think so\nVery few people ever store or read beyond the spectrum or the author for all of those things that he saw it was nowhere near as good a writer is H. G. wells uh as I said the books were called penny dreads souls and nobody really read them\nAnd they went out of print rather quickly\n... Charlie now goats Hiroshima have other stories and we have time for one or the prisoner of war camp tell that story Charlie\nWell uh there was one came forty miles outside of ... uh one of those stories where you have is from\nOne of the prisoners he was he and actually a couple of dozen prisoners were actually saved by one of the guards who that guard and his wife risk their lives to be sneaking in extra food for the prisoners\nAnd a Baxter who was one of the ones who survive it became friends with this\nMan after the war they remained friends killed their debt sit there to tears and Ken but\nHe always explained it as possibly a it was the\nGuards a Buddhist light and ... and at that time in Japan a Buddhist had to kind of hide their beliefs and their philosophy but this one guard he and his wife could have both been killed if it were famed at that they were making food into the ...\nThe book is go to ... to be published in twenty Nineteen Charles Pellegrino is the author or there is no explaining beyond the spectrum enjoy I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDo do you have a chance [noise] trying\nOut overnight lower fifty sixty sixty two for Wednesday partly the mostly sunny a higher sixty Seventy two son cloud makes your on Thursday kids for a shower I hired a baby I'm twenty two new store feed Ronald shrine lab but it's on one on one ... one o seven five W.

league as the league that comes after little league\nAnd it's the first time that the players on the real diamond you know the real um Ninety feet between the basis thing up till then you'd they're playing a much shorter thing in little league so it's a whole new game when you get past the little league because now you've got\nA runner's can take leads and run as can be thrown out or you're taking too much of a lead offers face there's a lot to it squeezed plays if you're very creative coach\nBut you can do all that sort of thing so um what happened I had this kid and he lived in um low income housing very nice kid I don't think he played organized sports before so he joined the team and he had some of the building so I mean we kind of helping them and teaching them the ropes and\nYou know I had my son ... was a sort of a de facto coach anyway\nAnd by the way a judge ... son Robbie and uh he ... a good friends from high school and they play together on the golf team at all anyway so I had this kid and then he got into trouble I think he was arrested or something that you had ragged grass or something I forget\nWhat it was it was not you know the worst thing on earth that I could ever happen to anybody but again this was a while ago\n[laughter] grasses comes just kind of embrace now it wasn't so much in that time anyway so he was put under house arrest the habit of ... he had a a an ankle bracelet and everything else put under house arrest so I ... I called the someone from the police department in front of the police department and he says well you need to\nTalk to judge gardens himself and so I talked to them and explain the whole thing there was a nice kid who made a mistake and all that\nSo he is under house arrest so he can't go anywhere you can't play ball and all that so I asked if I picked him up at his apartment and took him to practice brought him back and everything they sure he got right back in the house you know make sure he got in the door and the same with games everything else I Would pick him up and I were to pick 'em up anyway\nBut I Would come up and make sure I got back and all that\nAnd so we had a life long talk of the judge in Ireland or yeah he he agreed to those terms and I remember the kid when a kid would have been and what fourteen\nMaybe Fifteen for about\nFourteen I remember when I picked him up and of course he was very ... very popular with the other kids to the Republican and he had missed a few practices already until I had this uh order from the judge that I could do this so I picked him up and I take 'em to the field and he was like total freedom he just lie down on the grass or what\nBut I was a house in like a week and a half\nSo um yeah and that's sort of a an arrangement that we kept up through the end of the season and it was just this one little thing you didn't have to do it and a lot of people wouldn't have even answered my phone call\nSo are you know the judge is willing to give me the better the dollar willing to give the kid the benefit of the doubt and uh yeah kind of worked out nice\nTo tell you the truth I have no idea what happened to the kid and maybe ... but uh\nI don't know I don't know is is a nice kid but that's what happens in first of all when you coach youth ball of any kind of your coaching basketball soccer whatever baseball's what our coach you don't always stay in touch with the kids and one of the reasons is because they their appearance changes you know\nThe kid at fourteen doesn't look to say what he's twenty and so you wouldn't recognize and of course they'll recognize me but you know it took me a couple of minutes or\n... oh yah yah yah yah\nSo so anyway so you hope that you have but you make some kind of an impression on these kids but I don't know I think some of that as a little bit over rated because it's it's it's always a lot of the draw it or where you are at a certain time you're running with a certain time you can get into lots of trouble\nAnd those are better who reached out or what your upbringing is but\nBut anyway I thought I thought that that was kind of just this one little nice gesture that a judge gardens did ah for me and for this kid and\nYou know so hopefully ... you know maybe the kid has you know maybe stayed out of trouble and didn't get arrested again I never saw his name and the police log so I did see him years later or ... years later maybe you're ... years later when he was out of high school I did see him at the bank once and you look we must work and he's working for a construction company so\nSo I guess we met at All right so you hope that that works on and I'm sure that that that's a chance that the judge 'em ... does one of these things that it was kind of sticking his neck out just as much as a as I Am so anyway the judge ...

hundred million dollars that's what you have to live in independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with so the key is a ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never that's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely\nOn the money you save and it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Susan said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living\nOr not a a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want to see one enough money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled a stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it in the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement\nAnd they save like a maniac can they get to a point you know let's say in their mid thirties but they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and\nHere I Am working now talking to you it's sixty three\n\nSince I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to do\nA financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you\nOh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars\n[laughter] [laughter] oh boy anyway you know that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic

nature\nUm under the additives you have\nTo be a connected to the Internet on the chrome book and I just wanted to get your opinion on that\nRight so schools have been adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice in massive numbers and the chrome book now completely dominate the educational environment there are still a particularly in the private school environment where\nThey're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally but gosh it's moving that direction and Google\nHas a suite of programs\nThat are similar many of them in nature to the Microsoft sweet you are referring to\nAnd for the educational environment those are generally free and they can be used not just on a chrome book at home it can be used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make a crumbled useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it it would be a good question for you to ask going from a home school environment to one that is a more traditional classroom to find out if the school they're going to be attending is a crown books school\n[noise] okay that's a perfect point Clark or to follow that quick like um\nTell me about the column books ability to function in a disconnected state meaning stand alone or not having a access\nTo the Internet by yes okay they used\nTo be a complete door stop that if you didn't have Internet it was basically a worthless piece of furniture taking up space when it didn't have Internet connection\nNow there are a handful of functions you can do off line that then once you go on line they the

you particularly happy\nOkay All right well thank you for the life\nAnd the good news with windows computers is they've suffered so much by comparison the chrome books that windows computers that are

take an existing para frames and put new lenses and them\nYou will normally have to go to an independent opticians shop and have them do it and they will do a great job but it will be more expensive likely been starting all over\nArt and Justin says would asking for an increase in my credit limit on a credit card affect my credit score\nYes it raises your credit score you absolutely want to if you had been a good pair of a credit card\nYou want to periodically see if you can raise your limit\nBecause every time you raise your limit it lowers the amount of available credit you're using which is the second most important factor in a credit score and accounts for almost a third\nOf what makes up your credit score only give you an idea if you have a credit line of five thousand dollars and you're using two thousand to that are available credit you're using forty percent of your credit\nYou got the credit limit raised to ten that two thousand dollars is now twenty percent of your available credit and gives you a big booster to your credit score\nEarned Brian wants to know is it safe to submit your Social Security number to find missing money on the links there on ... dot com\nAs long as you're not at one of the advertisers in Europe the real things that I write about you go to missing money dot com you go to on claim dot org and then go to one of the state unkind property offices\nIt is a well as safe as it is anywhere to put your Social Security number but it is we're jihad and it's how you move forward with the process of finding if there is any money hanging out there for you\nIf you don't put in the Social Security number you're basically going to be shut down for moving forward with getting the missing money\nThat is yours and remember missing money is free to use you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nNazis to Russia\n\nI Know [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to get your mind on our first and uh my husband around this day and age how we can get started\nYou know have it here right you get started on a retirement plan\nNot at all not at all and that's why at age fifty become eligible for somebody noticed catch up which is a special federal or vision that allows you and your husband to put aside more money than other people\nCan to save for retirement to allow people who\nCan't get around to it till they're fifties\nTo be able to bulk up on retirement savings but if you have not been saving you know you you can't just say you're going to go from nothing to saving the full amount you're allowed plus the catch up because where's that money going to come from\nExactly\nSo do either of you have a retirement plan available to you where you work\nI Do have a four O. one K. and hard about it but they're very they're only about a year old\nOh are you a police officer now oh\nBecause usually when I hear a four fifty seven people are public safety workers to some guy\nI Want what the public eye on a bus driver\nOh wow okay how often do you have to call the police to come meet your on your route bus driver\nNot not very often go getter usually pretty mellow\nSo as a bus driver do you have a pension you're going to get from the bus system\nWell if I had it started with the economy years ago they had an Chen or that you know that are more senior but for whatever reason they can can for any new hires\nSo you're all come out on our own here okay\nThat exactly why you have it not that\nI can show and I do not know the tension is in St Paul I'm looking into that\nOkay well then what I Would like you to get doing is putting money in that for a one day\nAnd start with what you can if that's one percent of your pay two percent of your pay whatever number it is to you and your husband can still live your lives but you can start the habit of saving for retirement\nAnd then you're going to need to over the years whether you're working there working somewhere else with a retirement plan you need to keep stepping up the amount you're putting in and normally if somebody is younger\nI talk about raising it one percent every six months\nBut when somebody's past fifty I Want you to step it up one percent every four months\nOne percent error or a line\nAnd I want you to keep doing it to you can't breathe anymore financially from your take home pay okay because you've got to get to where you're saving\nA significant chunk of your paycheck to build up a reasonable amount of money for retirement and in your husband's case he is no retirement plan available to them at work is that right\nNow he heard that work for the last four years he started his job he had had an injury\nThat ... ... I'm really sorry\nHe's got he's got a great now basically I can support for the law or hear what it said\nWell wait wait wait wait that you've been living as a couple and you've been able to keep things going on your\nPay yeah so he should say that and what\nWe had a oh a battle captain going well\nSo what that means to me is that if if you will keep your lifestyle as it is is his pay starts to come back into the picture that she have is\nAnd the Roth IRA or since these past fifty he's allowed to put sixty five hundred dollars a year in it\nAnd I would set out where you do your budget where every year moving forward he can put sixty five hundred ended that now that he's working again\nBecause you really need to keep stepping up ... percent of your pay goes into retirement and he's going to need to build up retirement\nAnd that's how you get it done even if you start you said to me is it to white it's not too late it's just the work you have to do is more difficult for him I'd like him to go look at my investment guy to Clark dot com to see how the set up a Roth IRA\nAnd then start throwing money in it every pay period\nJail is with us on the Clark Howard show hello kale\nHey how are you\nGreat ah you're getting married\nI Am a little more than a year away\nAll right how can I be of help with this wedding coming up\nI'm I'm trying to go ahead and start looking at options for our honeymoon and we want to go somewhere tropical on the Caribbean and so it's kind of curious as to whether you thought a travel agents are worse you know getting or of course a lot of trying to find the best deal I can with all this time of uh\nDepends on how much experience you have doing Caribbean island vacations\nNot much we went to grand Cayman or with their parents was but you know and I'm planning I'm only twenty three so\nSo that's definitely a situation where you want the services of an experience travel agent\nOkay generally someone who has a C.

insurance works and why it might\nBe right for you on TALK today about something that is very confusing\nIs when you decide to buy something because there's a science screaming sales sales sale and then something that's become more and more popular\nWith department stores and clothing retailers the double discount so they'll say forty percent off plus another twenty percent off\nAnd so in your mind which forty plus twenty it's sixty percent off but no it's not\nBecause the twenty percent is off the already reduced price which makes it less of a discount and it seems\nIt was a study done at the University of Minnesota\nThey found that even when people were told look for the tricks and how something's priced and they were given calculators people still consistently\nMade the wrong purchase decision influence too much by the online seller or the physical stores marketing ads or in store signage that made you think you were getting a better deal than you really were\nWar that the way they had worded the discount you didn't realize the item was cheaper somewhere else\nAnd when we move into the Christmas selling season which gets earlier and earlier the first Christmas merchandise is already starting to appear on some store shelves I Know that's crazy in August but it's already starting to creep into the stores\nSo this time of year now through Christmas is the worst for you being tricked on pricing particularly with Christmas merchandise and through Black Friday week\nA lot of items being sold at Amazon dot com and being sold and physical retailers will scream at you huge discounts massive percents off\nWell that doesn't thrill me 'cause think about that four hundred a month of it could go towards the credit card debt [laughter]\nI Know [laughter] [noise] so what kind of income do you have\nAn about forty five thousand a year before tax\nUntil you got a lot of obligations that you've got to deal with I I can see why making a dent in the fourteenth five would be extremely difficult with your annual income have you at any point sat down with somebody from the national foundation for credit counseling\nNo I have and I hear all of that stuff\nDon't fear it for you\nI like you to go sit down with somebody there they'll have you fill out of long form where you lay out everything you is going to be easy for you because you've already um added everything up\nAnd then you sit down with somebody and let them help you try to come up with a plan doesn't have to be when they negotiate they may feel they need to or they may feel that they can come up with the budget for you\nThat will get you to where you can get this paid off in a realistic amount of time based on your income would be to take that credit card debt to zero in five years\nOkay and I know that's not tomorrow but as you go through paying on it you'll feel the benefits\nSo I Know you have to hear it many times and really process it before you'll make an appointment with an FCC but I Hope that you will will go look at the website and FCC dot org okay and process that\nAnd having somebody who does this every day come up with a plan for you I think would be very

so jealous you want to go to one of my favorite places on earth\nYou talk about it as wild chicken island I Believe ... y e yeah\nWow are you going to move to Hawaii or is this just a vacation\nUnfortunately it's just a vacation but we're hearing allahu Maui in Hawaii during a twelve day anyway\nWell congratulations thank you very much\nHow can I be of service would this Ryan\nWell I set up some fair alerts and haven't been watching a fair price but it seems like Hawaii a little bit of a different animal and we've seen fair though like eleven twelve hundred dollar range\nWhat are you trying to go from Europe to Hawaii where are you talking about\nOh ...\nOh man okay so the way you buy a ticket to Hawaii is you only shop fares from the west coast\nOkay because from Milwaukee you can get to the west coast\nReally cheaply their sales all the time okay and then from the west coast there's been sale after sale after sale to Hawaii\nOkay so if you if you do this thing called breaking the fare on the west coast where you have one ticket to the west coast and another to Hawaii it'll cut your overall cost probably in half\nOkay now some of the things you should do is you've been looking at the fair shopping sites fine but with Hawaii I once you're looking at the websites of Hawaiian Airlines\nAlaska Airlines and Virgin America especially those three\nOkay for affairs from the west coast to Hawaii when things is because you can city shop if there's a great deal of let's say from San jose California and it's better deal than Los Angeles or there's a better deal from\nUh San Diego than there is from San Francisco you just pick any of them and that's where you fly on on your mainland ticket from Milwaukee\nOkay so this is great to no\nEnd Virgin America is the nation's best domestic airline and they've been offering some great prices fantastic well I Want to make sure you have a great time how are you going to pick your accommodations on the various Hawaiian Islands\nWe did that part already and I've been listening to for a few months and we actually did the air being beer out\nGreat after looking at a couple of the different all rental

Howard show hygiene Centre how are you I'm great thank you ... how can that be of service to you\nWell we want to get guy Eric quite got insurance and\nA quarter of a thing\nThey had us reply slack at two hundred and fifty thousand for the house at south and the houses actually it was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars and the U.S are getting ... ... it's about thirty seven thousand five hundred and we're just wondering if that is\nAt all common or reasonable\nWell ... you want to have your house insured for what it will actually cost to rebuild it do you have a sense in your neighborhood if there was a vacant lot how much the vacant lot would be worth of their house on that they were going to scrape the lot and build a new house what the what the builder would pay for the land\nI like to have an idea because\nIt's the key is not\nWhat you did what somebody coming in to buy your place would pay because they're paying for the land in the house would be what it costs to rebuild the house on your homeowner's policy\nWhich you have I guess years of experience with what did they say your house is worth for the actual structural purpose\nUm for the ... south\nYeah with your regular homeowners forgetting earthquake\n[noise] um I think seven around seven hundred thousand\nHow many square feet do you think your house is\nI'm a thousand one hundred\nOkay it would be it would be unusual recall seven hundred and fifty dollars a foot to rebuild your house and I wonder if there is how foreign\nYeah right but even with that that's um the the big cost again is the way on the house sits on I see\nSo you know they don't replace the land they only replaced the house and I'm always worried about people being under insured on a home mhm which is why I'm going I'm feeling nervous even talking about it this way with you\nBut it may be and I I don't know it may be two hundred and fifty dollars a foot\nTo rebuild or maybe it's five hundred or whatever it is what it's going to cost you to rebuild the home and it is the amount the insurance should be for so do you deal with an agent a toll free number how did you get the quote on the earthquakes insurance\nWell we have monitors and I'm really ...\nCame up for renewal and when it came up for renewal they send us out something that said they have to by law offer you the earthquake also\nRight so I call and do you deal with an agent at that homeowners insurance or do you call a toll free number\nA tougher number\nTo call the toll free number and say please explain and I get your homeowner's policy out and see what the coverage is our please explain why the coverage is for the house or listening to so much less on the earthquake rider than they are on the actual policy\nI see okay because they should match alright it\nReally is seven hundred dollars a foot for you to rebuild than you know you would need coverage like he talked about on your house ... ... the thing with the earthquake insurance same for people who live at the coast to have to have a hurricane insurance uh-huh is the deductibles are crazy high\nAnd that's just something you're gonna have to live with\nSouth thirty seven thousand is reasonable\nWhile I didn't say is reasonable it's typical typical that for I mean yeah I I like that but I'm I'm more I'm as nervous as you are to make sure you're not under insure them and that of course will make the premium go up\nBut you want to make sure you have the right coverage Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Michael\nHow are you doing great thank you Michael what's going on in your world\nUm well I Am very proud to stay that yesterday I made a last payment\nOn my student loan my wife and I have been put in about ... eleven hundred dollars a month towards that and finally got paid off as of yesterday and\nWell how do I figure that calls for a celebration\nYes my wife and I broke out the policy brand or wine last night [laughter] great [laughter]\nSo yeah what what we're looking for is I'm advice to see if we're in a position to start putting enough towards our retirement now that maybe we can start using a little bit more now for a family vacation since touch\nWell certainly you freed up a weapon hundred dollars a month you need to treat yourself so if you were to to take like the first two months after you pay these off take eleven hundred dollars twice take twenty two hundred dollars go do something fun\nThat's a goal reward yourself you worked hard to pay off that you got rid of it and you know this is something I talk about that getting rid of debt is not supposed to be just drudgery followed by more drudgery there needs to be a reward a privilege that comes at the end\nYou it's a privilege time\nSo yeah and he wanted to take a vacation you go on a vacation\nWonderful and and I guess the the follow up with that I I feel we're putting in a a a decent amount away both my wife and I we have done it and since we're we're going to have government tensions on thirty four she's thirty three and they'll have a little over Thirty years and doing that\nOr you guys are all employees or state or local federal yeah\nSo you have access to
