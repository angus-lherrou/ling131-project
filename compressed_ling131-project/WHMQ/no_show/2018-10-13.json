Republican club on eighty third street by men wearing hoods who were acting according to Ed Koch center professional manner\nIn other words anarchist are we seeing them everywhere and they're not Republican they're not Democrat their anarchist but is that the force that unleashed by the language of the leadership and you make the case for that Michael\nSo I Want to press you on this one in this escalation cycle is next to watch for we've had our painting of Sumner that was Kavanaugh\nWe now have individual actions of renegades or outlaws or red flags that's what they call them in Missouri or the riders into Kansas the men who rented Lawrence where is that what next to watch Michael\nWe have permission granted by the leadership at least a blue not quite yet to read but we have the leadership of you to sanction\nA more aggressive actions direct action and that is translating already end of the kind of a\nSituation since as you describe and that would correlate to say the kinds of things that emerge in in Kansas and the\nUm I used to have the right on Lawrence right right but also you have a more generalized\nUm acceptance of the need for\nA resistance as\nThe only possible way that\nThat would be that people negating national ... national laws say in California or in cities set right underway and defiance of the center because it's regarded as illegitimate\nNow the only way an election outcome that was positive for blue ... that would be to suddenly shift focus to blue legislative options but if those\nTook a turn that inflamed read then you would have said\nWe're only talking impeachment Michael that's all I hear from from the man who was appeal have had of the Judiciary Committee who is a representative here in Manhattan he's talking impeachment not only of President Trump but also of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what you have is that there is no longer a belief that governance however you define governance whether it's a Supreme Court decision or or laws statutes that are passed by Congress no\nAct of governance can alleviate theirs and in fact any decision in any uh governments fear only inflamed\nThe situation so this is where I come up with this idea of of a curve that that at some point gets\nBeyond control that there's no way to call it back and you know other countries like China seeing this understand that this is there a moment\nTo potentially intervene once the U.S is fully a mobilized to achieve all of their objective\nLook what they just did Michael they disappeared the president of the ... in front of everybody and I have no explanation for it he says he resigns in post he's a member of the Communist Party in fact she's a senior figure in the ministry of state security\nAnd they're that China is arrogant to the point of believing that the international community cannot in any way make them pay for that\nThe moment the president is um through some sort of event\nShown to be not in charge or to be a made a ... in some form\nAn impeachment would be one of those processes at that moment something will happen abroad and that will be an earth shattering historical moment for the United states in the world and the the the people who decry\nOr the president will have been in effect those who have brought this on\nIt if Michael it there is a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle and their their pleasure and the escalation cycle for too many parties China\nRussia to name too but also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nRight and that uh with the American superpower weakened by internal drive\nOr our allies and our phone believe they gain another word that maybe it's there a moment to take a chance and we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not in the state I\nI Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that kind of disruption make a make America a disc organized to the point of not being able to defend it\nWell people living in the moment who are wrapped up in the\nBelief that they are in charge and we have less than a minute Michael go hey represent\nThe leadership those sorts of people are not I'm sensitive to nor are they going to shift in which the entire situation ships and there\nIs today I think a larger atmosphere shift in which expectation is now the driving element in other words the Chinese\nAnd the Russians and of course even the Europeans expect that this is going to be\nA kind of end game for America and as a result they are going to act accordingly and in America people who are in power whether they are red or blue\nAre simply obsessively and understandably focus on the domestic\nWhale leave it there Michael play house of Johns

dramatically awful and they were pulling people out all the time you eventually lost it it was the final count Peter because people die from their wounds as a twenty three twenty four twenty five\nFinal count was uh twenty three that perished or from the uh the mining and then there were another twenty seven that\nUh were injured but with a crew of only a hundred and thirty two you're

military expression for finding things where they are\nYou stole it [laughter]\nI Know what to say that All right you borrowed it from the United States Army I said yes yes five\nYou borrowed it from the United States Army don't they miss steel beams [laughter] they apparently they didn't I understand okay you borrow yeah steel beams than other a coach or minutes from the United States Army and you repair the ship yourself I guess that's what you know you do it yourself you know there\nThere were actually there were a number of CBs it also assisted in the uh welding and repair the ship\nAll right so you flow to ship off and you're now going to go to the yard in Japan is that where you're headed\nWe're headed for your couscous Japan which was a home port of the ship\nOr you've lost a lot of people the the ship is the ships morality shaken by your going to sail back to your home port and your sailing across the sea of Japan and here comes the typhoon\nCorrect yeah uh in the middle of the sea of Japan you're going to be hit with a typhoon and your ship is not entirely sea worthy corral\nWere not entirely sea worthy and there was some thought that actually the um the keel might have been cracked which we couldn't tell of the kill gets cracked a crack open on the ship breaks into two parts\nAnd here comes the Thai food do you remember the typhoon feet or I Do\nRemember and the hard part of the Las T is a very flat bottom that no no point in the um the part that goes into the water so when you head into heavy seas the ship goes up and then comes down and pounds into the ocean\nAnd it's a this is great fear that the pounding is going to shake the uh uh affect the car the hall the kill but also the ah repairs\nOn the ship or sell those aren't beams that you borrowed from the U.S army or a little shaky at this moment there is very shaky\nAnd after a while we have open water to the ocean it's actually flowing into and flowing out of the compartments fortunately because of the water tightened integrity that the ship had we were able to uh you know make it back to your school without\nUh any further problem\nSo sure you're just going to nonchalant a Thai food okay you get to ... and they're going to repair the ship and you're going to go back into combat hardy or they're not going to they're not\nPolitically in a three months later we were back in

Sullivan about the men who acted that night or to save the ship what is your memory\nMy memory is that they were courageous they fall or they knew what had to be done to save the ship and save the

really unsuccessful by exploiting their workers Amazon's not going to be the first\nWe go from one self made man Jeff Bezos and the future is bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer and New York and in the boroughs\nI joined the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions\n[noise] uh yes it most certainly does make you a self made man or let's look at the force four hundred there airs in it and there are self made man it it's very rare that there's both in it and Trump's case\nNo one's going to the night it surprised exactly no one that he inherited more than the one million he claimed but his father was a very successful outer borough real estate developer obviously a brilliant guy there's no question about that but Donald Trump has his name on buildings and Manhattan\nThe most difficult and competitive real estate market in the world he has his name on buildings around the world by the New York times very own reasoning he is one of the great marketers of all time or will ... relentless dealmaker if that's not self made what he did\nTurning what his father gave him into a global brand I don't know what is\nBecause Mr Trump is often in the news and because we're watching him as a president quite apart from as a businessman what I read in the New York times is that\nTook advantage of the ... uh the IRS in in in the in the rules that the IRS keeps changing over these last decades about inherited wealth I didn't see any law breaking John So I'm quite puzzled this resentment for people who have inherited money or the resentment for people who are self made\nThere's the suspicion is that they're doing something sinister\nJohn they're creating jobs if it's entirely lost apparently the New York times that that money that Donald Trump translated into his branding as worldwide branding has been responsible for generating lots of livelihoods around the world youth day at all the time John So I Want you to\nHelp the audience to understand why it is that rich people are the job creators\nWell let's say I want to stress ... your your point to New York times acknowledge that everything Fred Trump did to avoid taxes was okayed by the Internal Revenue service there was nothing illegal here and thank goodness\nFred Trump did and the Trump family did what Bill gates family does what Mark Zuckerberg's what any rich person does is try to minimize their tax Bill Bissett gets to your question the rich create all the opportunity precisely because they have unspent wealth\nInvestment is what drives economic growth there are no companies and no jobs without investment first so when we limit what the U.S Treasury cakes and we limit\nThe mess allocation of precious resources that is by definition what takes place in Washington there and

very serious long term effect of this explosion\nIn America over the past few weeks and what I think that having a nomination and a confirmation shows is the illusion that we as Americans hold about

Court electing a Republican president but the Supreme Court has so much residual good faith and faith in it as an institution from the people that by and large\nThe authority and the legitimacy of the Supreme Court was not significantly damaged I don't think this I think is different because what Kavanaugh's showed is that these are guys a guy in a black robe who's a political operative that is what he is\nAnd he has a right winger and he's an ideologue and can you imagine being someone from the ... the Hillary Clinton camp being in front of judge Kavanaugh\nAfter he screamed his venomous

welcome to the studio Gary\nFilter and during one burger they are professors of physics at Smith College in here today because well I Can't say it's breaking news because it broke a little while ago but there is a story\nAs I understand it the third ever woman who's just won the Nobel Prize in physics done Strickland can you share that story with us carousel they're absolutely\nUm so yeah Nobel Prize has been around for well over a hundred years and in that time a grand total of three women have ever won the Nobel Prize in physics and ah\nI I can pretty safely say that's not because there have been no other women in that time who made significant enough countries and the third is two thousand and does he vows in Eighteen as of October second Donna Strickland\nJust became the third ever a Nobel physics laureate and the first one since Nineteen sixty three wow I'm so Marie Curie in Nineteen oh three a rare ... minor in Nineteen sixty three and now Donna Strickland in two thousand Eighteen and that's it\nDo you tell us a little bit about the two previous women winners of the Nobel\n... Marie Curie is certainly you know one of the most famous women scientists ever she is the only person male or female to ever win the Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry ooh I'm and she did a lot of the early pioneers\nOn radioactivity I'm Alone with her husband Pierre Curie with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in physics\nUm and I have read that apparently the Nobel Committee was considering giving the prize to him um and that he among others objective that she had done just as much of the work as he did and\nUh they ended up sharing the prize the two of them and then about ten or Fifteen Years later she also got the Nobel Prize in chemistry I'm the second woman who won the Nobel to win the Nobel yeah there's a conflict Meyer um\nGot the prize in sixty three she ah came up with the basic model that ah we still use to describe atomic nuclei their nuclear shell a model\nI'm so when we make the structure of the Adam in our classes in school that's the is that her\nI'm not quite when you make the structure of the Adam you're just usually make the nucleus as a dot oh yeah and then you what you're making is the structure of the electrons around it now it was discovered by Neal's bore go for Meyer figured out that if you zoom in on the nucleus it has much the same structure the protons and neutrons in the nucleus\nLie in shells that look just like those models you were making a ... um but nobody and understood how that worked because the forces are completely different she figured out how to make that model work so with\nIn the Cold War explain that a little bit\nYeah frozen I'm so we've got electrons without neutrons Arnold's hanging out together and the core protons and neutrons are in the court the electrons are way way outside so one of the standard images people\nDescribed as if the nucleus where the size of a basketball okay the electrons would be out at the outer edges of a large cathedral\nUm the nucleus is miniscule die in the middle of the Adam and so people just thought of it is this you know sort of solid lump um but they knew there were these things they couldn't explain about it you have certain numbers of protons and neutrons that would always be there and other numbers would never occur\nAnd no one knew Ryan Gilbert Meyer figure it out it's because inside that tiny little dot they have these expanding shells just like the electrons in the outer part of the atom\nWell let me turn now if I might to dream Weinberger also a professor of physics at Smith College tell us what it is that Donald Strickland what's her discovery what's her contribution to physics that won her the Nobel Prize in physics this year the third woman ever spent forty five years\nIs really I have a fifty years over fifty years I had to do that on my head in my hand to try to\nFigure out it's been a long time somehow no\nWoman who was deserving of the Nobel Prize in physics but anyway\nUh Newman if not deserving of the Nobel Prize in math or or even arithmetic\nFor that matter I okay so how was that\nWell strictly at the time this was back in the Nineteen eighties was actually a graduate student ... row at the University of Rochester and together they worked on or develop the technique for I'm taking lasers which had been around for over about twenty five years at that point\nAnd figured out how to um make laser pulses extremely short and extremely powerful\nAnd so the upshot of that was it opened up an incredible area of all kinds of applications where they could investigate things that happen as Gary was talking about inside Adams themselves and very very short timescales with these very short laser pulses\nAnd all kinds of applications where they could use these high power pulses to do things like eye surgery\nA machining of aircraft engine parts are literally putting holes and baby bottle nipples all kinds of stuff\nSo the reason that I have had laser eye surgery and I have our new Nobel laureate and thank for that\nI'm In part yes [laughter] yes\nTell us a little bit more about lasers you are expert on this as I understand it and I would like to know not only about these applications but whether the new Star Wars movies now going to be even more brutal than the White House and because\nThe ... with all that a lot of a lot of what we uh see about lasers are not the industrial applications which are\nAmazing and knocked the laser eye surgery which you've heard about but they're also a laser pointers and such which\nOkay what's really annoyed already [laughter] I Know [laughter] I like to think they like it [laughter]\nSo let's back up a\nLittle variants her what is a laser ... okay well\nLet's start with what isn't a laser and that's all the all ... all the kinds of light sources that we're more used to like the lights in this room at this moment the sun et cetera\nAnd businesses have have developed this this term\nUh describe such light sources as incoherent which kind of describes that they're all over the place so there for the most part composed of what we call white lights all different colors which are different wavelengths of light um they go in all different directions and they're not in any way acting in concert\nLess incoherent light the kinds of light that we're used to in everyday\nRight here in because they can't get themselves Oregon I gather right they're cats chaos there kind of Zach representatives of the Trump Administration hunting pass without\nLayers [laughter] well let's try to stay away from the politics [laughter] but\nIn any case lasers are um as most people have seen for example laser pointers are very different and so they are highly directional so all those the light that comes out of a laser pretty much goes all the the the wave going the same direction um and also it's very what we call highly Monica traumatic\nWhich means single color so most lasers um have a very very narrow range of wavelengths it constitute that light and since it's so highly um like a pencil beam it can be controlled very easily with lenses and mirrors and such and\nI'm unlike a the the ... kinds of white light that we used to\nSew the laser itself as I understand what you're saying it's funneling white it's putting him through a very very small opening\nThe nature of of laser light itself is to be that to to emerge from the inside of the laser which I'm ... has energy stored in it and then when that energy emerges it naturally comes out in a very very tiny beam\nAnd his Monica traumatic so into the light spectrum is reduced to a very small slice of it so I have that that is so foreign recollect\nYes like white light goes from the the um you know blended his the spectrum to the red end of the spectrum and as most lasers are single color central\nAnd then they usually read or they may be in any of the oh they can be any anywhere ... lasers\nInfrared lasers all different colors of ... or any end of the ... yes absolutely there's even X ray versions of leaves me\nOkay so this light is coming through the various pinpoint it's very concentrated is there some proportion mechanism to this is there like a hammer

that actually produces concrete positive results\nYou know and especially after this campaign I think people are going to be looking to do something that's constructive or that actually helps people and uh like this is a way to do it so I'm looking forward to it even though it's forty three miles and uh but it's a it's it's for good causes with like a western Massachusetts\nNow you were posting on your Twitter feed about Trump's recent op ed swipe at the Democrats in their plans for a universal healthcare Medicare for all we want to reflect on what your thoughts are about ... taking the I mean that's the task on it\nBut yeah I mean look at what Trump is doing is worth Republicans usually do every campaign cycle is and you know they're losing out the issues they go to name calling you know you're a socialist or communist\nYour radical extremists the bottom line is what we want to do is make sure that everybody has health care and we want to make sure that people with preexisting conditions don't lose their health care that's something that Republicans have tried to do consistently during the last two years and Trump himself has tried to do that he um he a um\nYes this is currently a lawsuit or that the White House is filing that if they're successful it will allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions but he lives about immigration I mean look at this president as a pathological liar I mean and it's just enough is enough and I I look forward to the day when you wake up and\nNot have to read the newspaper and figure out what the latest scandal is the latest controversy is I mean we we need to start getting our government are on\nTrack to start bringing people together in solving problems like I'm a high cost of health insurance and the climate change and and making sure that people get paid a livable wage where they work I mean there's so much to do and we we have to deal with his nonsense every single day\nAnd it it's tricky for people who are your your casual consumers of news to when they hear Trump I Know I had a huge rally and it feels more like a campaign rally spouting these things that are mere filing untrue and unless they do the research or the media has struggled or does the research for them in the way we live in this crazy time like Nineteen eighty four\nYeah I mean that's the thing is that you know when you're president you amend the bully pulpit I mean you dominate the news so\nHis lies get recorded every single day and some people buy into off a and we just have to do a better job of correcting the record pointing out his record uh and uh you know look it's just getting every time you think you can't get it going lower he does I mean not just with this latest off that and the lies but\nYou know his his rallies and which now to talk about what you have to have Feinstein or you know even you know when he was before the capital are confirmation you know making fun\nAnd mocking a doctor for a you know to a great applause by some of his supporters it just so it's so gross [laughter] so I don't know how to put it and I just you know I and I just believe that\nThe country has to send a signal I'm In these midterm elections that uh people or do not\nBuy into this this is not who we are and that's why I Hope everybody who can vote is registered to vote and goes out and goats undercover such\nYeah thanks to Taylor Swift are getting a huge bump in the Senate from the voter rolls up an interesting story to follow this we do\nUm this ah question comes

where no man has gone before they go to summer doctors I mean there is a ... billion in our solar system that's correct\nThis is a new door fish planet and that has the\nDiscovered its official name is not the goblins it may come as surprised as well\nBut it is two thousand Fifteen T.

G. three eighty seven that we are talking about a job\nThough\nIt was discovered as part of the search for this large planet nine or ten if you're going to the blue or the planet they haven't found it yet but it's still on them I think that the orbit suggest the existence off and other body and this is how\nPluto was found because something weird what's happening in the afternoon there was a prediction made that there must be some other planet out beyond Neptune and lo and behold poodle gets\nDiscovered right but I really cool example is actually the discovery of Neptune itself that was discovered in Eighteen forties at the time I was trying to most had discovered you're nuts and they were like well but its orbit suggest that they may be a large sized object out there\nThey could also predict and I'm nothing but early Nineteen century they could also predict whether it would be found that ... will be at a particular place at a particular time even though we have never seen it all you have to do is to point\nThe telescopes in that direction at this place at this time you're going to find this planet and ... that's exactly what happened and in fact it really spurred interest in science and also crushed in science because we're like well if you can predict things that are unseen this must be powerful and so this\nGoblin door planet may be indicative of some other bigger planets out there in our solar system if we know about all these other planet we found Mr Spock Vulcan\nAround another star how can we haven't found another giant planet in our own solar system it'd be like if a guy who lived in your basement and you didn't realize that\nIf your basement was really really huge they've added the problem I mean it it's just that the universe is so huge it's hard to find and remember it is so far away that you don't get that much light from it either the goblins strong with the lucky to find it right now in most of which are but it is to find for us to see it even with large\nTelescopes and it has an orbit of our own\nForty thousand years most of the time you're not going to see it so we just got lucky that it was on the closest approach so the same thing\nMaybe with this planet nine that's the reason why people are trying to search with large telescopes\nLarge areas of sky it's a tricky thing but two other objects I should mention along with a golf and that have been found said no neither do all kinds of I think that was discovered by a Michael Brown who demoted Pluto or in the first grade and also better than other object to call or two

similar male friends stereotypically characterize as hearty athletic self confident party loving et cetera uh-huh\nA whole lot of stuff I mean there was the clear evidence of trauma and not just not being able to reach her relatives but not being able to reach medical care not even knowing like what's happening day to day if there is access to clean water for food was coming\nThere's just so many things that people were just cut off from completely their basic human rights to communication the stories are really important to have really tell what really have any impact but also as a healing justice\nPart of the work I think that\nSome of the times we have these conversations but we don't talk about the impacts of trauma in our communities and how we need spaces together and community to to really deal with it and the dress it and move together to continue supporting each other through it so I was in both vehicles and comedy to facilitate those stories are close with my\nFriends that free press and with Melissa or Saudi Arabia runs a healing justice and the colonization projects and particle called step up\nAnd you're talking about the importance of these conversations and then there is a matter of creating and maintaining the base in which to have those conversations and there's where the technology can come in you know so I wanted to ask you about these portable network kits that you also work with\nRight so part of the project and my understanding of community technology as well as the ... transition for for the call means that our community is also need to have the access to the infrastructure they think it's one thing to say you know we're going to push the FCC and the telecoms to do the right thing but it's another whole other projects\nTo validate people's self determination by the ownership and governance of their infrastructure and so in a colonial situation these things go very very difficult and so the conversations that I've been having people there is like what technology is available that could support a lot of these kinds of efforts he stopped\nTermination efforts that are happening throughout the island the most notably through the camps the mutual aid centers that popped up I think there's maybe eleven or twelve of them that popped up\nImmediately after the storm to do everything from feeding people to health services acupuncture I mean you name it they've been doing that work and they continue to do that work when you pass the hurricane so in my conversation with some of these folks it seems like\nThey were looking for a technology that could be maintained and governed by communities have local usage thing but I mean by that is\nThat if Internet fails this technology the portable network we started using hearing your city through there was an atmosphere where the project which is probably what was mentioned before where we have five communities that are building their own local networks so we produce these portable network cats and they were initially just\nGoing to be used as a repair kit for our\nNetworks that are here but we realized that they had to use an emergency situations are portable because they have some\nAdditional security measures there for a novel a small one could be a little three hundred dollars and they have different kinds of resiliency features including you came\nPower them through solar panels and battery packs so there's a variety of ways in which there they don't really really useful so we did the training with one of the cams and some ... called me get all they're doing ...\n... a variety of things from feeding people to self defense classes to as long as he planning so they invited us down with myself and\nSome colleagues meaning technologist colleagues from the point which is one of the community organizations that's building the network and behind one section of the Bronx they came with their digital stored on digital stores is the name that we use for our community residents were trained in building maintaining\nI'm running the ... ... ... and sharing again local governance and control ... built a small\nLocal network there in ... and that and I work as is up and running and when I was mentioning before the thing a significant about it is that it can work with the Internet so it can help to share the Internet to different sites but it also can function as a local network without the Internet\nSomething called the island mode to people can continue to communicate with each other and a local space and sent files to each other videos\nPhotos just communicate basically you know when everything goes down and so this is a really important tool that folks and put the sequel are interested in using and so we've been working with folks there for excited about that\nFor the ongoing work of the mutual aid centers throughout the island\nWell the power of course of these very local and sort of direct people to people communication goes well beyond the fact that they can continue to function even in times of environmental catastrophe it's also what they get to say we saw spate of stories after Maria about\nWhat you call this mutual aid we heard about communities working together to clear the roads and to fix houses in the absence of\nSupport from the state\nBut it's very evocative to think about applying that mutual aid ethic to communication\nYou know there's a sense as a media critic you always get the sense that you're supposed to win the media you know that social justice organizations have to win the media and that's the way to speak to the people in order to change things but this is a way of working around and without\nThe elite media in order to tell stories that need to be told\nExactly it's like that focus on central as technology is which is you know movement out across the world this is not a new thing but it's a movement to really support\nSelf governance in a place for ... colonialism is the rule and very brutal former colonialism menu liberalism that is impacting our people even after hurricane now they're trying to put all sorts of\nAwful privatization schemes on top of that and so a lot of their relationship to the telecoms has been one very much of like client\nRelationship rights are really trying to shift that narrative away from that to wind of again self governance community control again not things that are new but really trying to utilize existing technologies that are\nAffordable as a way to support that very basic human right towards self determination\nWell I I wanted to ask about that in particular the relationship between the U.S government Puerto Rico wasn't reflected of course only in agency foot dragging and the the curtain was pulled off a the the new year of it you know the arrogance of that relationship with that image of Donald Trump tossing\nFreaking paper towels who people at an aid distribution center if there were any mystery to it I think it should be removed but all of which is just to say that taking control of the narrative and being able to subvert imagery that pervasive that means particular things for Puerto Ricans\nDefinitely absolutely certainly the narrative of dependency the narrative at the federal government was putting forward that somehow we are to blame for the mystery that colonialism causes\nThat are people get locked gratitude\nFor the work that was being done when actually things we're not getting their we bring getting food we've aren't even getting tarps most of the talks ended up on the island came because people are often they're the ... sent them there so there was a huge failure on the local and federal government level and you write it absolutely did\nReveal that the ... colonialism the brutality of it unfortunately I seems that a lot of the media has not learned our lesson and so\nContinues to promote a narrative of dependency of paternal Islam and doesn't recognize the amazing work that people are doing to help each other to support each other and that's what I saw when I was in the ... you know community is very impacted\nAlso by poverty ongoing poverty it unveiled the brutality of of the political and economic situation and so\nFolks have been have been supporting and doing what they can to help each other out throughout but I think at this moment because of the hurricane there's an opportunity to shift that narrative there's an opportunity to shift resources to shift\nUnderstandings of what the relationship is between for her to go in the United states and for the rest of the world and so I'm hopeful and also incredibly inspired by the people that I met I spoke with who share their stories who are\nWorking in their localities to promote these ideas that runs off determination because the process of the conversation is a long process but it's one that has to be at the forefront of any conversation whether it's communication and the sovereignty whatever it is that the root of the issue\nWe've been speaking with today's ... be the director of resilience jumped technologies thank you so much today so that's the only all for joining us this week on the counter spin\nThank you so much for having me\n\nThe second Monday of October has passed and listeners may have noticed that there was less in fourteen hundred and Ninety to Columbus sale the ocean blue than they might remember from the past\nMore and more cities states in colleges have officially changed the day's name to indigenous people's day and acknowledgement that Columbus his legacy of mass murder rate invasion and enslavement is nothing to celebrate\nChallenging the glorification of someone who did such horrific harm is welcome but changing the name of the holiday might give some the impression that that harm which is ongoing has been addressed\nAnd that would be just on true but unhelpful our next guest is among those asking that even should the whole country go along we think more deeply about declaring indigenous people's day a completed intervention\n\n\n\n[noise] what do you teach him\nSo anyway what do you are as I turned\n\nFollowing\nIs a paid commercial announcement any opinions expressed or not necessarily those are the only way to be its staff or management any claims made during the program are those the advertiser and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of WHM pretty the following an encore presentation of\nReady set knit [noise] morning I'm ready set on your patio is always something that has these together we are the owners of webs America's yarn store right here in North the Internet and on line at WWW dot Yahoo dot com\nWinning any more than he might give everybody a heads up what we've got going on in the speech else we could do that first that'd be okay great so coming up today we are going to shake things up a little bit here at ready set ...\nWe're going to start off with our guests were going to be talking with no sign of it's a parole man and the upcoming fiber camp in Boston so hang on to that\nI'm never going to talk to Steve a little bit about his experiences that it teaches west and um [noise] how I never quite made it and why [laughter]\nYeah it's been a long few days long we if you don't follow me on Twitter Facebook you don't have a clue so\nI Will do that in some highlights and trends in which these type of show 'em and then in the second half I'm going to talk a little bit about a new line of accessories that just came into the show and then we'll throw things back to see for his a yarn picks of the week and see what he's got for all of you know you're all started to freak out a little bit like left\nFor the twenties for minutes oh my goodness just we got a good show this week so we do change things up every now and again so um let's see how this all goes so we're\nGoing to jump right in and a rather than Steve reading the newspaper in the second half he's going to read it here in the fresh stuff [laughter] you know newspapers and you know they didn't they selected and took them up but uh let's go right to our guests ... died a good good friend of ... and a dear friend Stephen ice skate a welcome to the program\nAll right thank you for having me on absolutely\nIt's it's good to hear you and you were out at the store over are\nA great big game event because I Can't call it what it really is um for fear of being sued so and I knew I missed you then because kids keep obligations as always so at least we get to talk lived in person which is wonderful\nYou're so I was there and I couldn't believe how many new trick or treating your story I'd never seen so many ... would seek everywhere they really put over\nWe're pretty creative when it comes down to it [laughter]\nWe really are and you know in the Senate bums me out of and I've said it on the shows I Love that day because it's not about a sale it's not about anything but just coming out knitting and hanging out together for a few hours and kind of escaping the house and the crazy football fanatics men or women in your house young or old\nAnd I just just kind of it's sort of like a little little respite for everybody in the little bitty spot trip to the knitting shop without any you know it's great to people shop but there's no expectation and I love that part of that day\nIt was a lot of fun and I fear it very well and through ah well I'm here to talk about today\nWell yes people may know you from your blog and podcast it's a pro man and it's a problem in dot com but you are here to talk about cyber camp Boston which is in a second year I Believe and an event near and dear to your heart so why don't you tell folks what five or ... Boston is\nSheriff of fiber camp awesome is a conference which is to say that it's like a regular conference where there are are factions in time for such a throughout the day but unlike most conference or destruction they're put together by people who were hungry event so\nEverybody's a rock star everybody has something they can share\nAnd people come to prevent ready to participate and so people offer different ... throughout the day um they're blue how our our groceries or they're not you know quite frequently but they're usually you know little pieces of all different types of knitting or other related or related activities\nFor just spinning or dying or even how to use robbery or social media\nOr a knitting and all these sorts of stuff\nSo it's a very exciting time and it was a really off Antarctica which is the first time last year and we had about eighty people show up over the weekend\nAnd it was really a lot of fun people really enjoyed it really felt after two days and spending with a bunch of other new voters or that they could really how can I I really love new friendships made a lot of people learn how to crochet that we can actually including myself I learned a little bit more about crochet a very excited about it\nAnd we think it is you know about this sort of format that attracts people what makes it different I'm trying to help our listeners sort of understand it like an ... okay that's a big word what does that mean sort of but you know what is it about the event the tuna gives it a different feeling a different vibe do you think it's that sort of grassroots participants have really driving the content kind of thing\nYeah I mean there's two ... two or three finger different than most of it's been through in the community or the the things that are different or we'll see but it really focus just on the community itself it's so ah the one in Boston will be very different if there were another five recap another part of the world it'd be very different there about the local community getting together um\nAnd the second thing was different is you know it's it's not really about selling more votes you're having a reason to connect with other people and the conference itself you know it really you know people will go to different questions sometimes we go or even if they're not ... are interested in learning to just go to help out for last year I just touching on learning how to drop spindle\nAnd we had about thirty people show up and I heard at least four or five ... new way more votes than I did and it was just great to have them there to for help out with the rest of the group and it was just so much fun because everybody really got something out of it\nWell and I have to tell you I see that that is listed on issues um sessions as well and I'm really hoping it gets flooded in at a time when I'm there because learning to drop spindle\nAnd possibly learn spinning wheel are things on my bucket list my fiber bucket list for two thousand and eleven to when I saw you were doing that I said okay I have no further excuse not to tackle this\n[laughter] well I Hope to get to make it for that fresh than I Do\nI Do too I'll be really bugged I have to tell you though for someone who's a a borderline type a my ducks need to be in a row and if one is across the pond somewhere I get kinda stressed out and I live and breathe by probably to a fault schedule and calendars and things\nEvery time I go to the website and check to see you know do we have time to watch it and I think I've emailed you at least once if not twice about it\nIt's kind of strange to me\nWell don't don't don't be too worried and the next and the next ... there's only about three weeks left before the events\nAnd starting this week and we won't be able to schedule letting people throw in a structure and we are going to leave some uh some of the struggle was open to make sure that people have a chance when they get there to offer classes or during the week and people said oh you know I found out to be more interested in this topic and I can talk about that let's do this topic\nSo if you really should have for the community to sort of design conference as there are there are at the event\nNow that is an awesome aspect that I didn't realize so if you know\nSay I come out there and decide oh my goodness everybody needs to know how to let's do something like ... well that would take too much I don't know whatever the topic may be and I came up and said hey can you slapped me in and that tend to ten thirty when you've got a room opening and so I can go over you know how to putting a zipper\nBut actually if you remember the wall ... basically made up of sticky notes and people would have to put up a sticky as to what they're like oh what's it like to do with er during different treasury\nAnd basically that's that's the whole scheme of how we do it and you know it starts off on the weekend we have all what you did right now at a fiber at Boston pd works dot com and that's where we begin the process and then the process and the actual physical a schedule or which is a lot of fun to have the real World Trade or you can just say\nOkay this is open your input is pretty up and that's what I got to do\nThat's awesome I Love that idea I Love it now well they're also you said it's\nYou know and obviously the education is you know sort of top lining up in a thirty to sixty minute I'm slot you're sort of just pretty much touching the surface on the topic but I think it's such a great way to get people sort of intriguing something or from my perspective who's wanted to learn how to drops then don't tend to get over that\nI don't know fear factor intimidation factor oh I don't have a Sunday afternoon to go and take us to be our class factor in this might just be enough to then you know be that push that I Need but what you were saying it's more of an education and listen to the marketplace what about this is going to be any sort of shopping opportunities I see and all that\nOr we will be having some vendors to support the camp\nOr the vendors there because people do want to shop when they go to the patrol boats and they also beyond just dropping they really are interested in and oh I Want to do this thing but I forgot your homework productive argument fiber I don't have a draft and do\nA lot from our local or or your job will be there or were from your and we actually have one our local daughter who's going to be there or with her own she just watch or a new line of yarn or were\nExcellent I'm folks who are just tuning in um I'm Talking with you know ... it's a Perlman dot com and he's also one of the you're one of the founders correct\n[noise] welcome back to ready set and here in our second segment as we're changing things if it's this week I'm gonna have to give you a quick review of a new line of project fags\nEnds up or patches that we've just by didn't find it from T. N. N. A. and then she's going to come back with his yarn picks of the week but I have to make one quick call up before we\nGo there and then the show's over and we wrap it up because today is a very special day today's Jackson's last hockey game of the season\nFor his school team which means he may have one or two for this into Larry Keane than he helps out with but this is it the last cold drink I have to sit in with that child\nAnd then it's a really cold right to it really is and then it's on to Chile wet damp\nAcross seas and yeah I mean it can be just as cold at La Crosse games was just going to be outside\nBut he's not a goalie there and he just looks like a little ... so so enjoyable to watch after nine months of hockey\nSo I just had to call that a while we were here so I'm I Want to hop right in and talk about this new line of knitting project bags I found this supplier AT T and an eight which is always one of the reasons we go to the show we've done our major buying but we're always looking for the new in the fresh\nAnd it's a line called chi chi\nAnd it's C H icy dash a sort of Sheikh ... I think is probably how they pronounce it and they make practical fun is what their website says they have super functional items and they have really ... fabrics that they use and the company's been around since about two thousand and seven\nAnd the founder like many of us was carrying her knitting around in a Ziploc bag and said there's got to be a better way now there's a lot of nice\nIn a claim that there aren't that this is so new and innovative but this person is taking their own twist on it and I thought it was kind of interesting so um this to project bags to zipper pouch is and a young keep I'm going to run through really quickly\nThe main thing about these products is that they're made with beautiful cotton fabrics bright ones Ikle flowers polka dots fruit prince butterfly prince\nUm they are fully reversible which is wonderful so like this project that could have in front of me as a solid hot pink on the outside and and hot pink polka dots on the inside one side has a pocket on it and then the bottom blast bottom two inches\nIs a coded fabrics so it's water resistant would I put this in a puddle no but if you steal your ... iced coffee or your Diet Coke bottle of water or you're meeting will be protected\nUm it also has a plastic liner inside that his removable also to help protect your projects and the dress string is very nice it's dirty and I like the caught and because it's not real stiff sometimes a project that cotton or stiffer durability which a lot of people like it's not my taste and so that's one of the things I like about this bag\nSo the project that except itself is called the quick draw their two sizes of the smaller size which would fit\nSize would probably fit my flicker scarf or those have you seen it might be a little bulky I mean certainly socks are less bulky a scarf project bits and parts of sweaters you could definitely fit in here again depending on the gauge the smaller size retail for Eighteen fifty and a large um which is bigger than a large block\nA retail for twenty five I Believe\nThe two I'm\nDeeper pouches are unique in that the ones we bought have clear friends so you can see all of your stuff inside which is awesome you don't have to set of shuffled around and everything that you can see where you're ... or where your cable needle is or your scissors there are three sizes we brought in the small and medium and\nAgain the friendship clear these ... and the bats are that same I'm treated caught and the uh\nUh uh a\nFabric that's been coated sorry last for adults upon it did I was like coded coded uh so they again they're going to protect your accessories and find the right wing chuckle colors and the small a poll chat as it's called is twelve dollars and the medium is Thirteen and then last they have a yarn keeper which\nAgain is all coated plastic it has a zipper top with a little handle ugh Ramadan top and the very top part is also clear so you can see what's inside\nI'm good size for good size skinny and I have to have probably a hundred grand you might hundred grammar would fit in here anything beyond that or anything to do both you might be a little challenging but\nUm I think the standard scan of young you're going to have no problem with it in that retailed for sixteen dollars and again just fun bright window colors and after this winter when I saw this is really neat\nSo that is my push for the latest and greatest accessory if they they should be up on line by the time this heirs and that's certainly are in the store so if you're looking for them just sat asking that one of the stuff on the store flow will\nPoint them out to you cool great ... so that successfully now what kind of yarns could they put in these new project bags and the yard and keep her while that was a great leader and\nI are highly paid professional here\nYou're hired a we've got a four new new yards and then the close a dream continues to roll 'em and we've got some great close up for it to the first year in your new you're onto the two new\nRowing orange for the spring or the first one was called ... which is Ninety four percent continents six percent so um and you'll see this in our um fall catalog ... fall catalog spring catalog that is just a arriving in homes now\nAnd is on line on the website as well you can see the online version and flip through it and shop directly from it all the links work\nFor it and I'm so Panama savannah Robert is I'm a taught in rather than the silk is actually a rapper its effect them um [noise] a wrapper on this ... this eight Ninety five maybe seven and a half yards a four and a house to choose to be in an eight\nAnd it is here and watch a lot of a dedicated a patterns to this particular you're the second urine from Rowan for the spring is called Panama\nAnd it is I'm fifty five vis those thirty three hundred and twelve percent women and it's really kind of interesting because it is the um this goes is literally wrapped around the cotton or in some cases it completely in cases the con and in some cases it leaves the cotton\nI'm showing so you'll get\nThe um the shrine of the disco send them a little bit of the ... are presented with a really nice texture it is for them it's a six and three quarters stitches to being on a three although that really doesn't look like\nOh you know I think it is it makes them yeah a hundred and forty if you did this much at a much looser gauge this for a look really sleazy\nAnd joined overlooked sleazy yet is okay um the fabric you know does and occasionally just ...

him\nAs he scans the skies are planned to at least for migrating rappers on hawk mountain these central Pennsylvania I hear you saying hello Sean you must be they're good morning\nI re how are you are doing well and I guess uh I Know there was some fog expected down there I looked at the forecast for ... mountain itself was going to be partly sunny today but but still a lot of fog I guess\nThere's actually more fog here today than there was yesterday who [laughter] unfortunately and that was a lot yeah friday was a good day and about now I had was whether we go to all that Tom Burke moving so\nI'm okay I'll take one out of three days\nOkay one one out of three it is so friday you're up there so you set a good move into birds what uh what we're seeing up there on friday\nThey had a nice mix your bird that ... that a couple of arrogance falcons Burlington sharp sharing Cooper talk um\nIt was just looking at their tallies um for the year they haven't had a gossip talk yet to share and still way and golden eagles but those tend to come in a little bit later in October\n... and we know the broad wing hawks we gave a number of there are a few minutes ago the generally the most uh numerous species you'll see in fall hawk watching really some amazing numbers but are there are number is starting to taper off now that we're in October\nHog once you once you're in October they really don't see broad wings anymore that's really kind of more of a September um movement of those for is once you get into October it's pretty rare to see a Broadway at that point\nIn ... so what about other bird species of the non raptor variety songbirds and such\nYeah they had a little push of um some of fall wars we had a black for green yesterday uh some ... that's really true I think they have a yellow around and full\nOf what was that some ... looks at some woodpeckers or\nA red bellies and some yelled deli sap soccer's and apparently um I think it was last week a gentleman who was on the lookout had a golden plumber fly over that he heard at first and then ... ... and that's pretty rare to see her ad hoc Martin apparently so yeah you\nNever know what would you going to see which is a more of the exciting things about all kinds of bird grabs right we've got to get out there that sort of like so it's a pretty famous place hawk mountain um what what makes it so ah so great for ... watching compared to other mountains or the big hills\nAbout one of the things about hawk mountain is you know this location they've been doing all ... counts here of migrating raptors longer than any other place not in the United states but in the world and so they've got data going back I Believe it's in the\nThirties or if I'm correct late thirties I Believe ... and um you know it's really special place you get up on the north look out the spectacular that people are very passionate about what they do the\nFolks here talking about and I've got to know many of them over the years and they're really dedicated to\nTo conservation work and the research that they do on behalf of a rafters and um it really is just a special place you know I'm for those that have been here you get that that by that feel the the second to arrive\nIn the hike up to the south look out which is you know fairly close to the the visitor center is nice but the north look out is where all the official count and goes on and that's where you're trying to get to the big crowds of people you know waiting for the big pusher of birds as they're kind of moving south and if you get a lot that goes through which I was kind of hoping for that\nWe can't 'cause it looked like there is not going through\nI'm going to get in turn out as as well as I Do but yeah it's just a very special place\nSo you're climbing up the mountains of birds are getting up to the mountain in a different way like really to to phenomena involved right updraft since ... that the raptors yeah\nYup yup yup dressing and ... you know is what they're looking for the kind of have that effortless flight to save energy as they are they migrate south and talk about and provides both of those\nUm on friday we saw a little bit of that all the winds die down so they will probably wasn't getting much of it up trapped at that point um but yeah when you when you come down there and you kind of get conditions just right you can see it actually taking place right in front of your um it's it's it's an interesting phenomenon to stay in the view is just spectacular can sign cases you're not looking up at the birds\nOn the lookout when they're kind of breaking to either side of the ridge you can sometimes look down on the birds which is a really a nice view of of ... are kind of moving by as opposed to many ... sites where you are just\nStrictly looking up and so that's the other nice thing about\nThem and and your your your of viewing the birds and a ... the idea of that you have to get some altitude generally for for a hawk watching but not necessarily a lot of equipment binoculars but really not scopes right\nNo I you know interestingly enough or you see a fair number of people that were bring spotting scopes up to up to the north lookout a I mean not a lot I mean it's certainly more but I could use some people that will bring their spotting scopes as well you know I tend to bring my camera equipment up they're hoping to get a few photos and I got a few on\nOn friday which was nice um but yeah certainly a good pair of binoculars and um\nYou know like I say good conditions in terms of the front moving through and I was northwest friends and and um you know October now and you and we get closer to you know men in late October that's when some of the golden eagles are moving through and you know they can have over the course of the season are probably upwards of a hundred and fifty golden eagles have moved through and I've had some\nReally nice days down here in the past and in late October and had as many as Fifteen or twenty over the course of a three day period so unfortunately unfortunately but this year I came up this particular weekend because I was\nI'm presenting a program here last night show my latest documentary video so that's why I was down here in early October typically I Would come down the last weekend of October\nSo talking about binoculars Sean ... what would you recommend for binoculars ... knew the kind of a of a big wide field of view right\nUm you know a good eight and a half by you know a pair of binoculars of some kind of do that I use ... and there's lots of other\nGood binoculars out there but yeah just a good pair of binoculars you know good glass um I always tell people you know invest your money in a good pair of binoculars 'cause they'll ask you a long time don't don't necessarily cheap out because if you buy a cheaper but ... you end up buying shovel over the course of\nMany years because they just don't laugh but if you got by a good pair of binoculars at all last year probably your lifetime and it's it's a it's a good investment\nJohn Kerry's vice president of eastern mass hawk watch in the co founder of migration

it's not I don't know\nI keep looking for it anyway a and I was so I kind of I boycotted the the Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nNothing is a drug or not but just like oh my God another late night show with another guy how many kinds are there on late\nNight let's see there's a Jimmy Kimmel there's Jimmy the other one from NBC than just even called bear and then there's Conan O'Brien and then the bill Maher\nWent up just like so many it's like and now another one [laughter]\nNo but the other day I heard something yeah I listen to Trevor Noah speak about\nA ... you know this kind of an odd time this Trump time and I realized well I've been missing a lot because he's he's funny sure and he's also insightful and that's something we don't have a lot of on television is insightful\nWe have a lot of the the drama that plays out on all the cable channels where the same old same all analysts get you know they make it via lead from one program to the other one to the other one sometimes in one day you can see on on a ladder on four different programs\nAnd the and I mean in like that with everybody\nAnd it just becomes echo cynical chamber um yes I we agree Trump is crazy and what else is like no Trump is crazy just keeps going on and on and so when I listen to Trevor Noah and I'm going to pay a little bit of what I heard\nI was very encouraged and the I really like them now and I was wrong to discard him just because he's the guy yet another guy I should say on late night\nJust doesn't mean that there shouldn't be more women on late night if somebody does mean that there should be more women they now because I'm sure there are tons of women who are funny and also insightful that should have their own program\nBy name\nBut I thought this was very good in this era of it's just a voucher rage because of what Trump has been doing and then my ... and he's now when the Supreme Court oh my God a second second uh second sexual predator is on the U.S Supreme Court no wonder we're also upset\nAnd some in some men are just ... are starting to figure out\nOh I get it I see now why are so upset I I didn't realize that the world was so unfair to you I mean I kind\nShe's talking about the essay at the essays called the ah the uses of anger women responding to racism and she's talking about anger as a political tool and she's talking about it\nBeing precise like what are we angry about and how we're going to use that anger so let me see what I wanted\nThis is my favorite quote I have settled the wolf lip of anger and I have used it for elimination laughter protection fire in places where there is no light no food no sisters no quarter so she's basically saying that anger saved her life\nThat so I feel Arlene I feel that anger is what strengthens me right and even though we are taught to not be angry that also makes me angry and that\nMe strength to sway I called you and said I Want to talk about anger yes because I feel like um well I grew up in ... in the middle east in house\nDrivers the genocide the I'm In genocide my father's experience a lot of dislocation although his financial situation was better when he was a young man came here to go to Colombia\nUm but\nMy parents especially my mother wanted to control me\nAnd\nHow I Survived was rage rage I Would scream hate you and I was energized by that and talking on like this week and last week about women's anger\nI realized that my mother was very angry and this is one gift she gave me her anger it hurt at the time and it was I I shouldn't have been the\nObject of it but it allowed me to be angry despite all of the other messages that said don't be angry be a nice girl and I thought last week what if Christine Blasey Ford had been angry\nAnd I'm not criticizing her I Am not criticizing her at all but what if she had been angry and then friends reminded me that probably it would the outcome would have been the same\nHowever I Would have felt better if she came in there and said you know what I Am really mad I've kept this all these years and now this man who had bused me is going to be sitting on the Supreme Court I Am furious\nI that's a very interesting question and as you were speaking of trying to imagine what she would sound like angry especially with that voice of her said it was it was a surprisingly young girls\nYes it was a young girls with the very interesting observation\nAnd so but I also think yeah it it doesn't matter if the the end result would have been the same kind of on I Would become a\nMatter for the result I don't think because they decided this you know and and they are display of anger now so that's what's different you know Trump said be angry and he was I didn't watch it I I I was busy\nIsn't that something I I I could not watch Kavanaugh is speak only in a small pieces I I I've only watched Trump at his rally in last week in smaller pieces now I Can't do it and Lindsey Graham also I watched that did you see Lindsey Graham but no no no I didn't\nChannel and I couldn't is that it's as if they were they were mocking doctor for ... and all women who have been right is sexually assaulted\nWell worse than mocking worse than mocking so when people say women aren't allowed to be angry it's this it's this response which trivialize and were attacked you know and somebody said to me yesterday you know\nWell the response is so bad okay the response is bad but we need it we need that anger and\nSo when I saw it again about Christine Blasey Ford and what would have happened if she had been angry I think I'm by myself and all the women outside who are angry and we would have been\nThat anger would have been validated yeah you know yeah and again I'm not criticizing her at no no no that's that's that's what they are very difficult thing she did and I don't know what I Would have done but she was making nice with them and joking and\nIt was kind of like Patty Hearst to the Stockholm syndrome any type of thing in terms of she was very solicitors of the very people who ... who were going to disregard her completely right she did everything she could to survive\nRight in that way but in a way like how does she feel now how would she feel if she had been screaming at them\nWell what like it I was having this conversation yesterday and I'm interested to know what you would you would would you would say like if she were in my family what would I told her so she where your family if you had a way of speaking to her like what what could you told her my response was\nDon't look at the news right yes he got appointed you did everything right this is just the this is just yet again a another example of how we as women or desired I Would hug her and make her a really good meal [laughter]\nAnd you had the ...\nAm and then what are the rest of us do though like ... I might it might cortisol levels are way up here they're very high they've been high ever since Trump White house they just shut up even more and I feel actual along with my anger\nA sense of ... what is it doom and dread dread [noise] I'm not sure that everybody's gonna who needs to come out on November six is going to vote [noise] yeah\nI I Am for the last six months [noise] excuse me I had not been watching television news and I feel much better\nAnd the way you find out because if you read\nI'm informs mhm nobody yells at me mhm I don't have to listen to these horrible people who are in power um\nI Know what's going on I informed but I feel much better and I try to do things that I can do\nUm you know I write postcards I make phone calls I you know I'm I'm a member of a circle of care for refugees you know I Do that stuff and I try to take care of myself and my friends mhm because I think that you know and and I've been thinking oh this is really terrible this is really terrible\nBut um when has had not been terrible\nWell yeah I mean in in your own family there I mean in genocide and it's like personal you know in your own life in your own life but yet when it's always been terrible we had this conversation sometime ago it's always been terrible right well then why does it feel so in the end of days terrible now\n[noise] ah because I think we are diluted to think that this is a very strong democracy but when you look and see who who is a democracy for women didn't get the vote until Nineteen twenty\nYou know African Americans now the voters being taken away naturalized citizens are being in danger of being the citizen eyes I mean settled or no separated from their ... their parents you know but you know when when people say oh that Supreme Court\nIs being politicizing this has had never happened before again like taking children away from their parents excuse me the Supreme Court\nHas always been politicized will always be politicized because\nThe justices are nominated by the president and they are um but has not confirmed by the Senate and look at the Supreme Court after the civil war every single law that came before the Supreme Court\nAfter the civil war a Jim Crow law was validated and was validated by major majority eight to one eight to one eight to one night\nSarah but isn't it also through than than in the late fifties and in the sixties and through the seventies we had a different Supreme Court that was much more\nEvolved well it was politicizing the other way and the other way and I still militia size what are you saying it's always bad what do you think ... the Supreme Court is as political as anything else\nWhat do you think that like you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg and yeah so now so but my daughter and a leg Elena Kagan\nWhat do you think these associate justice as we can you imagine being on the Supreme Court and use the oh my God they just voted in another special printed right and then they're supposed to show that they're not politicized even though they are right\nRight but some of them got in with bipartisan support the yes on along party the party lines so I Want to put that I'm trying to think it's like being made to work with a sexual predator\nThey are made to work with is sick to sexual ... yeah they are they're literally being made to work with the sexual pointed it was a maniac and never speaks yet [laughter] right you know ... Kavanaugh now [noise] it's totally [noise] excuse me validated to what he said one of the things that Kevin I did was\nI read it before clerks at each of the justices assigned they're all women and\nYou know and and as you know that he he coached to women's basketball as well I Wonder if sort of in a similar vein how Ted Kennedy was responsible for the death of Joanne cook much go back to ... yeah yeah I'm I'm probably mispronouncing her surname\nListen to news talk from your backyard only found one on one five I'm sure Johnny and one on seven five and Franklin John Doe age to be [noise]\nChance of showers today otherwise I thought it was a high and your fifty feet welcome them\nTonight mostly clear with the low around thirty five on Sunday we'll have sunshine with a high up around fifty eight and Sunday night partly cloudy low at forty three this is pioneer valley weather on one on one side and one of seven five W.

Hi this is Ira brick and I will to another episode of the show and um every week we kind of look inside of another company in the pioneer valley and\nYou know you deal with a lot of ah people in life that you don't realize are running businesses and there's a lot of things that you attend that you don't think of as a business like if I went to a jazz festival I might not think about this is the business and that's where we have\nToday is we have ... who's the director of the downturn north Hampton association the DNA high high\nAnd Ruth Griggs who is the president of the north Hampton jazz festival much to both of you here earning now the audience has heard your different voices and we'll know who's talking but occasionally remind them to Suzie argue this is Ruth so this is very exciting\nHope to be around that weekend October Nineteen Twenty one but just both of you just take a shot at ... talking about the north Hampton jazz festival ... its history what's going on at cetera\nSure I'll I'll start a little bit the Northampton jazz festival had been around downtown for ... several years till roughly I'd say three or four years ago\nUm when it trickled off and our organization started in two thousand sixteen shortly after the ... of the DNA shortly after the jazz festival anticipated\nAnd I found myself getting question to all the time she would be great to have more music downtown gee that jazz festival is wonderful with only that could be more jazz music downtown and so I took the hands and reached out to the north Hampton jazz festival and ask\nThan Bagdad perhaps we could think about bringing jazz back to downtown north Hampton and I connected with Ruth\nAnd Ruth you had headed it emits earlier for\nNo I was I was a acted as a marketing consultant and media consultant uh-huh I'm ah in two thousand fourteen and Fifteen of two thousand Fifteen was the last year that it was held uh-huh\nIn a big tent behind ... for it was a originally designed back in two thousand eleven to kind of replace the taste of north Hampton uh-huh so it was a combination of jazz\nAnd food trucks and vendors and\nThe retro fair and the beer tent and the twelve my meal it became a little bit of like a a little bit of everything uh-huh\nAnd when I met with Amy and she said like do you think you could bring this back maybe I could help you but I I don't know anything about booking the accent I when you were so have that covered ... and we can take care of that um\nAnd we decided um mutually very easily that we wanted to change the model mhm um because the model behind thorns had become very expensive and cumbersome to stage and manage and\nSo Amy and ... who's the producer of the jazz festival\nBoth came up with the idea of having it all around town uh-huh and I was really excited first my models ... yup and uh the ... one of the reasons why we wanted to do that is\nOf course to bring more live jazz literally all around town and have more of a benefit to the merchant you're in the past\nAnd secondly it to less expensive model right so we're hoping that it will be more susceptible\nSince ... when you're diagnosed what happened when you said that the old version of trickled was partially those costs yes away but there was absolutely uh-huh and then I guess you know a few of the taste north Hampton\nUh everybody eats not everybody loves jazz and I think a lot of people that say they loved jazz love elevator jazz so\n[laughter] just discuss who's who is your audience\nLovers of jazz um young people who are learning and playing jazz as well as\nYou know octogenarian plus love to hear the standard um I had a wonderful call from a woman from Long Island two days ago who said that she'd heard about it and she and her husband come into north Hampton for the first time to hear the jazz festival in North Hampton which is great um so I was I was thrilled to hear that\nUm when I saw many I'm Sorry\nSorry I was going to say lovers of live music in general we have friends who are coming into town to come to the festival and they don't really love jazz necessarily but they love going out to hear some really good live music and you know being created by people who know good musicians are bringing those good musicians into downtown writes exciting\nBut I think a lot of people have more preconceptions about drugs than they might have about rock for instance and and uh\nYou know if you come and you're in the right state of mind you can sit and love it even if you're not a veteran lover absolutely and I've been to a lot of rock concerts around here between the Green River and the uh one of the mess smoker and things like that and it just seems like\nYou get a lot of children and grandparents in like the people that show up at like ... what is that person doing it a rock festival but it's just a happening\nI Am passionate about helping to support this kind of unique of that is truly north right and and and keeping\nThese kinds of things are going so that north Hampton ... and and a real destination\nAnd there's other benefits to this that affects north Hampton mental north him for to talk a little bit about the student education program\nSo we as ...\nOf this um jazz festival worked really hard to come up with the way to make it a way to give back\nBeyond just bringing that traffic to downtown and we reached out and learned that there was a jazz program happening at JFK middle school was clear and Williams they have 'em to jazz bands and a huge group of middle school age children who are just getting excited about and learning about jazz\nAnd the board of the Northampton jazz festival decided that it would be a wonderful way to support 'em up and coming jazz musicians and just encourage the growth of jazz throughout the community to partner with Jeff came middle school and create this um scholarship program to when I talk\nA little bit about the program yeah so the idea is that on Sunday or we are culminating that jazz festival with the hotel north Hampton jazz brunch and that's going to be an incredibly delicious award winning brunch\nWith a live jazz quintet ... and it's a fundraiser for this new jobs in the public schools program mhm um and we'll have members of the JFK a middle school band playing as people come in and the whole notion is that\nUm in in collaboration with the north Hampton jazz workshop which Paul or ... and our producer has been running for eight and a half years here in North Hampton\nHe will be bringing in a professional jazz musician\nThree times a year to go into the schools on Monday to work with the jazz students directly one on one and clinics and workshops\nAnd then the musician will spend Monday Night go back in on Tuesday Morning doing assembly for the whole school\nAnd then of course he he or she will play at the workshop on Tuesday night which is always on Tuesday and invite the ... the kids from the jazz band to come and enjoy the workshop\nAnd joined in on the the open jam which always happens on Tuesday night and so it's a wonderful example of collaboration between\nThe workshop the festival and the public schools which which were just over the moon excited about and Allen Davis um who's the founder of the the Davis financial\nGroup a list or piano player I forget which can be really ready to these ...\nIncredible lover of jazz and and he is a huge supporter of judge job creation yeah\nSo when he heard about the jazz and the school's program he said well I'd like to ... so um we've decided that should we have extra funds that we do collect on Sunday that it it's going to go towards a scholarship\nFor um a deserving um high school student to go to the jazz in July program which is the UMass jazz in July program so either way we cut the cake we are you're supporting young musicians learning that\nSo I don't remember the details of this was pre coffee at four in the morning but I just sort of north Hampton one yet another best town in the world something or rather what does a\n... because I mean I I Know it's one of these awards through the years and you just talk about how you feel like north Hampton is a town that kind of has the bones to put on the festival like the\nShore I think that I'm One of the things that makes north Hampton the wonderful place that has to live and to be a business owner is there's a strong sense of community and collaboration and our downtown\nNot only do we have this wonderful mix of unique stores and restaurants they're owned by our friends and our neighbors and our parents and our siblings\nAnd they're all looking for ways that we can collaborate and work together to to help better downtown north Hampton not old saying all votes rise with the tide I think it exemplifies\nOne of the things that is just the most unique and special about north Hampton and when you bring in a festival like the north Hampton jazz festival that comes in and says we want to bring music you know downtown to Northampton\nWe had a tremendous number of businesses step up and ask how they could help how they could sponsor how they could hang a banner how they could hosted musician how they can help us publicize and I think that\nThis type of collaborative effort as Ruth was saying is is what makes north Hampton unique and what helps festival like this um thrive in a damper on like\nAre in so many attractive buildings and the sidewalks are so wide and capable of socializing and the streets are big and it's just great I mean I I've been in this town for other great stuff including you know the the whole town streets or women's march many thousands of people\nRight and I think we have some new spaces that are being made it in different ways that will ask you park of course is the one that everybody champions but there's improvements unpleasant street fairs\nYou haven't been down market street lately\nThere market a street is hopping I'm at in ... north handled and the railroads right click York's basis on market street I'm even historic Northampton under the bridge also is doing great thanks so there's a lot of wonderful energy and non traditional for North him downtown spots which gets helping\nAnd all that so you have a lot of different venues ... how many simultaneous Sox world there will be\nWe actually are not doing simultaneous acts on Saturday on as we want to give the proper respect and phobia to the musicians that are coming here to plow\nThere'll be um they'll start at eleven o'clock in the morning it click or space and morose brag and and um and he said he was great and then the expandable brass bands will lead everybody downtown from there\nTo the Unitarian society and the part of the room with ... and we'll go back and forth between those than you are very well coordinated right and and the um\nAnd were thrown will park and it's like you know three thousand more people with ... a\nGood question um I've been obsessed with that for about the past six months or so we not only have one map to tell people where the parking is but we have to uh-huh we have a printed map that I'm just sending to the printer now I'm which will be available to hand out to people\nThat shows that exactly where they can park in exactly where all the venues are going to be and then we also have an interactive Google Map on our website uh-huh um that that does the same so\nI mean how widespread is the marketing I mean I Know that was the hospitality present some ... pulls from New York and further\nWell I mentioned the woman who called me from Long Island your hum and with Google advertising we're we're pulling from all across the northeast uh-huh literally all all New England and all across the northeast is great\nAnd I we have some significant partners that are helping the mass fine arts center has really stepped up to support this festival and their reach amongst their audience is tremendous and so I think that's giving us a big boost\nIn spring so just to another question about jazz you know sometimes you see somebody like a Jackson Pollock group of ... or five year old to do that and then you see that they can also paint something that looks like a photograph\nOr do you find a lot of jazz musicians can play in a very traditional league discipline way among all that jazz is just chaos but\nAny jazz starts with the with the ... with the tune mhm um it it certainly that that type of jobs\nStarts with that tune whether it's an original tune or is the standard it starts to that melody and then they take off from there so I think it I think it is approachable but it's it's\nPeople don't understand that notion of there's a there's the original form the original song mhm and then they improvise on that song right that's basically that the it's a central structure of jazz\nYeah and then people that come from one period of jazz or another is due to deserve tend to be respectful whole evolution of the art form or it's like that's my ...\nWell I think that everybody has opinions um when it comes to the music that they love and what we're trying to do at this jazz festival is represented wider range of\nMusic and Tom jazz genres as we can um from from vocalists too you know renounce folks like picky though to um guitarists and everyone in between um we wanna we wanna\nHave people enjoy it and in many ways as they possibly can\nSo can you just give me a brief answer into the business side of this whole thing what is the organization known as the north Hampton jazz festival\nIt is it five oh one C. three ... the previous president um spend a lot of time and effort to achieve that status and that's huge and very appreciative of his effort\nSo even when the festival stop for three years you must have had hoped I was going to spark up again if you kept before everyone she's very\nLet's just put it this way we kept the five oh one C. three and I'm really glad about that [laughter] but yes you can only imagine that after it had been um quiet for three years we did have some serious kind of\nBringing back of everything from a legal perspective and a taxation perspective in organizational perspective and that was that was a lot of work last fall and\nI'm very glad that Amy and I got together I think originally and like the spring of two thousand Seventeen right just start to begin to talk about this and I'm Glad we started yeah because\nSee the artwork that I made when I was that age\nPre school middle school high school they save that are for you yeah of course definitely the younger stuff and you know I get up to surely it would have all gone on to serve it surely is your grandmother usually complicated woman\nMy grandfather was always very connected to his own past and wanted to help me stay connected in my past so every year he'd give me a storage been in power me to save art worth I wanted to save ...\nI was so moved by this book I'm Glad that other people who buy too because I was moved by it because I Know you and I've known you know for a longer than my children have been alive ... and I hope you don't mind us talking a little bit about this but this book is so honest\nYou deal as a child would not knowing your mother is a heroin addict you draw yourself out essentially of the despair or is it at least ... an avenue for you to have ... other things in your life to think about and to the point they become a successful author and illustrator\nAnd to the point where we as a radio station with you have put together the successful kids music and book festival melt down every year\nAt melt down is when you find out\nOh ... so ... so and I don't know if anybody knows this Halloween I think that the local audience might if they really they are a lot of ... to to your real life and ... ... yeah I think if they knew a little bit of that back when you have a parent\nWho is addicted to heroin addiction or ... any addiction really you do have this dual identity right so\nYou have the image you put forward to the public and you have that in her demons at you struggle with so around the time that gene and I welcome their second kid into the world my mother started getting arrested again and and she was still in West or it was pretty clear that she was using again but she kept she was you know a master\nLiar you know really good at lying but you get your point we just see through those lies and it was clear that she was using again so it was march of two thousand and Seventeen\nAnd the phone ring and it was a relative's informing me that my mother had died of a heroin overdose this Thursday nights\nNow friday afternoon we're going to set up for a meltdown Saturday morning Jeff ... biggest author we've ever had come to melt down from dire everyone became fame knowing his presence is going to make the crowd huge\nAnd that verbal of okay we've never tried bringing some one of the stature here that's going to bring in thousands of people on top of the thousands of people that know town or gets and so the first thing I did is that it's you know like no one can no\nI I can not spend the day had meltdown getting condolences from people right nobody can know until we're through with this weekend and it was one of those meltdowns where it was you know the ...\nSo many things behind the scenes so Jeff candies heck wasn't working and then it was okay we're just just pen and paper object you can do this you know and then somebody left like\nTheir kid they my point is it like you have had you have this persona here in the valley and in\nIn the world really as this children's book author ... ... really fun and funny books for kids and all through your whole life has been this undercurrent of this going on that we now finally\nIn public see through this very intimate way and we see it through both lenses could we do still see the drawings we do still see the beauty\nAnd and the love and the darkness and yeah\nAnd that was a big part of you know it took me awhile to write this book I started thinking about this book\nEarly early to thousands when I started getting published because initially I thought well there's a happy ending for the kid who liked to dry was published but the happy ending was no like that kid who had the family turmoil grow up and fell in love and started his own family like that with the happy ending right\nThe publishing career is like a nice anecdote for what the main story is ... but then when I went to write it I Would hesitate because I thought well now I'm known as the happy lunch lady guy and if I Want to really writes this I cannot pull any punches\nBecause my grandmother had a very solved emails yeah very salty language which I Love oh you know I like\nKnow if somebody wronged you should go and just tell him to go sit in their head which you know ground them I'm eight\nYears old [laughter] device that I give my own children and the same way too though so it's something to that some power and\nAnd you know the times where they got drunk and that their lives were dark and then of course very much it's dark aspects of of my mother's life uh so I got to the point where I wrote down the following month trial right like you don't give up [noise] and it's not that I don't hear about\nStory I don't care about the reader but I Can't worry about what people are going to think about me I Can't worry about how this might affect my career because I did feel it sound like I'm really putting my or on the line to to

financial health is also likely to be severely weakened even if they have insurance [noise] some people never do recover medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy according to a number of surveys and insurance may not help as much as you might think\nWe know that from surveys people say they're in deep financial trouble even if they have coverage so both of you read the insurance policy carefully and if you talk to people about what their experiences our insurance at this point doesn't offer real protection\nThat Dr David ... distinguished professor of public health at the city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually sick most people are faced with such high co payments from the ... that they are in deep financial trouble even if I have coverage so many of us have policies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance kicks in and\nEven after that a lot of policies say you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and hospitals steak can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now and did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible in this country and that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles are rising and co payments are rising\nAs you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which\nHave help people but it's still left them in deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of\nSix thousand dollars now for most families of six thousand dollar hit that comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all of that what's the average bill for example this left for someone to pay out of pocket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews shocked to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we want to know what I was a financial consequences of that and does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies emerged all of those credit report record with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat Dr mass you know to dig do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of the study which search millions of hospital in financial records\nHe says there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nWe do see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average man their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the deductibles and co payments\nOn their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individuals just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those agreement might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency\nHowever it's a little different for those without insurance the average patient is in the hospital for five days or so according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and no till would they do says there yet with higher unpaid bills as you'd expect yet it something else that hurts them the most financially\nSo if you don't have insurance on average you you generate about five to six thousand dollars in unpaid medical bills and most of that almost all of it goes away if you are in short\nBut whether you're insured or uninsured both group seem to be affected by a hospital admission in terms of their labor earnings\nTheir earnings declined by about twenty percent on average and that lasts for a number of years so it takes quite a while for people to go back to normal and for many people we also see some evidence that they ended up retiring early claiming Social Security earlier and in some cases even applying for disability insurance\nNo till would you do says that the most ... finding of this study it's not medical bills that put the average family under financially when they're sick\nFor many people as seems difficult for them to return to work after they go to hospital and you know once we saw that it's not really that surprising I mean for some individuals when they go to the hospital that serious\nEvent it might make working more difficult there might be short term or even long term disability maybe it's not so surprising but it's not something we were thinking about ahead of time which is just that after you go to the hospital and suffer\nSome kind of health shocked that so serious that you end up needing medical treatment people return to work slowly and they end up experiencing earnings losses reduction in income for them is actually for their entire household that persists for many years\nIn many ways he says the labor dislocation after major illness looks like a town where the major industry has suddenly closed\nAnd everyone loses their job and then they have to go back and try to find a word in many of those case studies people take a long time to get back to where they were before and I think what was surprising to me it's just for how many people that look very similar they have a similar kind of experience just from a health event from going to the hospital\nHe almost sign says that's a major reason that says that occurred during a medical crisis or potentially much more damaging and lasting ... from things like credit cards everything falls apart at once\nIt comes at a time that's the worst time in your life so sheer gravely ill and running up big medical bills that's a time when your earnings are going down at the same time that the bills are coming in and of course the stress of illness and the disaster of illness\nIs coming up the same time as the medical bills are coming yeah so that's different than buying a house or running up a\nBill on your credit card for other things and the other thing that's different about it is that we know that it's stopped people from getting a care that they need and that that can have\nBut how do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance or not it's hard to say but even if you doubt many she says poly ... supplements are still safety is\nThe concept of overdose doesn't apply to a certain number of things right\nAnd it turns out that you just can't eat enough vegetables\nTo poison yourself on vegetables so you've never even seen that before my goodness we've actually seen people drink too much water and actually poison themselves with water but we never seen an individual eat so many vegetables that they poison themselves on vegetables it's just not possible and the safety factor of the ... I mean\nThese are things we normally get in plants and in the plants that we need the most so we have no toxicity level to them if we're eating or vegetables and we're taking the pollen means we're still not going to have an overdose circumstance will just be more stress resistant more bullet proof when it comes to the stress that we face every day\nThe key factor many people don't realize that they do or don't have a hormonal imbalance until it's tested and that's done through saliva test\nHowever the breakthrough science and Polly means isn't something you may hear much about since the end result is into drug it's a supplement then Darrow says supplements operate under FDA rules that generally prevent manufacturers from saying much about them\nAnd certainly there are barriers that the FDA has put in place obviously their interest to safety\nAnd with a supplement their interest again is basically safety\nAs far as making claims we can claim that we've been able to help assist promote but at the same time you're correct there are certain disclaimer that obviously the FDA has in place that prevent us from really\nGetting the real total message wrote there as to what the product couldn't do\nThere's a reason for that and then she says it's important to notice the difference between supplements and drugs\nAre not treatments for disease these are promoters of wellness you don't cure\nYou don't create anything ...

charge\nKind of a lot of the stuff they offer is free it's one of those premium business models like a lot of apps on a smartphone\nAnd they don't publish their priceless for the things that they charge for but if you'll let them bother you from time to time was so stunning emails you put in your email address and they'll send you\nA priceless for the things they do charge for ... you are allowed on a background check you charge the tennis for that\nRight and do so these services white cozy dot CEO and another one I'll mention that tone by trends union\nCalled my smart move dot com they're set up these guys ethically for you as part of your application which is perfectly legal on any\nBig apartment operator would do it for you to have an application fee and that applications the\nCovers the cost of you running the background check that way where you'll find as you look through different sites if you want to find a list of a lot of them probably you could look at ... dot com which is kind of a clearinghouse of information\nFor landlords but the what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site\nLike some of them all they do basically is a simple credit check where others will do a more thorough background check to see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kind of stuff\n[noise] so what what level would you recommend as far as going how deep would you do a background check or a potential to\nThat is impossible to answer and I think it depends on your experience as a landlord what areas have been traumatic for you with
