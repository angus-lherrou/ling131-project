Bush administration\nLate in the administration uh and\nThen the Clinton Administration inherited it so that's why in late Ninety three\nThe U.S is still involved with special forces in operations movie Black Hawk down is\nTelling a Hollywood telling of the first battle of Mogadishu erosion Tom Johnson or here so we know that we've been fighting in and around Mogadishu for twenty five years at least twenty six twenty seven years of you stretch back to the early days of the u._s. landing in\nSomalia bill the Italians who struck some in Mogadishu what is the expectation\nYes or so and Italian a unit part is part of the European Somalia was hit in a in a district in Mogadishu with ... suicide bombers with is al ... as you know twenty five plus or to just about twenty five years later\nYou know al ... continues to haunt us in the west\nIn Somalia and ... and ... title was involved in the black Hawk Down incident Mohammed ...\nWho ah he was killed in two thousand and one involved at nine or ... kind of military leader he was in Mogadishu\nOr some other kind of trainers and they instructed\nThe tribesmen who were fighting us during the black Hawk Down incident on how to hit the U.S helicopters hit them in the ... the the Blackhawks and the the rotor the tail rotor and that's what brought them down and cause you know the\nThe the may lay and that lasted ... days in the city so you know we continue to fight allocated to this day ... its branch there as we noted earlier\nThey are they the Shabaab likes to use suicide attacks against everyone and anyone that it can ah it it had a a in a hospital in Somalia is one of the\nWe were the first I Believe there's two or three American suicide bombers of that have conducted attacks Somali that's where the first American suicide bomber ended up to this attack and and I believe you get a un compound a couple of years ago and killed dozens of people\nAnd so the Italian operation was struck by the Shabaab a operation do we operate just quickly bill do we operate forces on the ground in Mogadishu absolutely\nThat us special forces a partner up with African Union and Somali forces and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab and there's heavy combat and airstrikes or to bail out um our forces and it's about this is the partner forces there\nYeah the long war we think it's Afghanistan no Somalia twenty five years and counting Tom you know that Mogadishu the Shabaab still mention HUD county when they when they remember their origins\nYeah you know it's still not really understood the John but\nOne thing is we have to document all the time is the fact that Shabaab and other groups like them around the world\nHave adopted the kind of program all the way through and this includes all sorts of different operational I'm sort of a strategies and tactics right down to the ideology and sort of the playbook there for who they are going to reference as sort of key ideological figures and in their thinking and how they look at the world involved in the county is certainly one of them\nUm you know Shabaab has referenced the economy's in their propaganda and the tall bond as well a number of times and this this is just not something we find to be uncommon with a lot of these groups and it's one of the one of the indicators that we look at to show how these groups are in fact I'll ... or part of okay there\nWe go to advise the attack on a military parade many wounded many dead and last week when we discussed this there were videos provided by the attackers of martyrs in the operation but it's in much dispute these last days by Tehran\nThat the attackers were ISIS a mock news agency put an announcement out ... and Tom you tell me their airstrikes launched by the Iranians in Syria that seemed to be a coincidental\nThe Iranians struck Islamic state targets in eastern Syria as a response for what happened in Nevada that the tacit admission by the Iranians that despite all the bluster they know that it was in fact the\nIslamic state the carried out the attack the Iranians for their own reasons and their own interests are very keen to blame anything on the Saudis the Americans Israelis there's a whole laundry list of sort of actors that they try and point the finger at but the bottom line is that there's there was early on after this attack was already evidence that it was the Islamic state not\nDispositive not foolproof but there was strong evidence that it was his honesty\nAnd that evidence I Would say in my judgment is gotten only stronger over time including what\nThe cats and to make sure that they think that as long as they did but John in the last Fifteen seconds go ahead Tom if they'd even release a very special message from its

I mean all the park and\nIt totally dominates the area\nUh they're dealing with a super wash up and it's wired into our network so it's not alone out there to that destroying the captain the P L A navy captain make the decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does\nYeah I'd be really really really surprised if the Chinese captain was making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works in addition to all of a chain of command issues because for instance are kept in was not making decisions on his own\nBut you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels of the military so these decisions were being made back in ... during a at extremely high level\nThat is man you mentioned in our campaigns acting under orders to can you explain that\nYeah this is the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of the seven fleet or I think that we're talking about ... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region\nWhich would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations the top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally a prize of what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was so clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made it\nThe lowest levels a detail guard and we're told within these last hours that Secretary Mattis will not make a trip to China\nA it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward do you find any significance Gordon given Mr Madison's last visit where there were a sharp words that the Chinese are no longer talking ...\nYeah well this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm no cold\nThe trip you know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum it's in their interest to have this milk Tamil exchanges and they're calling them off because they're upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got suction Beijing court now acting like three year olds\nThat status Gordon so what does Madison now when the when the ... his counterpart is available or does he accepted\nMeeting do they know where does he say well you know I might not be available now myself\nYeah I ... that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made 'em but maybe by the president in consultation with senior White house staff um you know clearly\nI think that the administration should say look you know we're not ... not available for meetings with you until you guys decide to act responsibly that would be my response unfortunately that's not the way people in Washington think\nPeople in Washington think that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they pure desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese um discussions these discussions do produce anything you know except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they're not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to the\nCourt and this is a question because you do a great deal of Congress have a great deal conversations with major media figures and your travel\nHave we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken how we how are we past that now are we are I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed China but I Can't tell whether they're still feeling whether there's still some sense that we can repair this I Can't tell\nIf we can repair job but we shouldn't try to repair it because we're pure to desperate in the past\nBut I Do know what the you know the past were ongoing\nYeah I think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired because we're not going to make the effort they're not going to make the effort\nWe have got to raise all sorts of issues of their objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this so I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good\nFor a very long time I think the relations are going to be good because good is getting what you want good is standing up for your principles we haven't done that for a very long time John and you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to China and we need to support him\nLater on this evening I Will have a conversation with captain Jerry Hendricks US Navy aviator retire we will talk about the

you very much for having me on John um I Would say this is a more of a victory for Congress than it is for the Trump Administration certainly gives President Trump something to talk about on the

October first as been dealing with a continuing resolution which is a document that Congress passes to say we didn't get our work done on time so you're allowed to continue spending at the exact same rate on the exact same things that we're spending on in the previous fiscal year\nUntil and then there's a blank there that they fill in with a particular date now there are some smaller agencies this

is joined by Andrew McCarthy [noise]\nI'm Brett Kavanaugh Josh ... comment on this show temperament\nThat's right that is now become a debate because judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary committee within these last days defended himself from allegations that are completely over the top craze\nAnd yet because he was in Tempe rich in defending his honor his family's life\nThat means he can't sit on the court goes the argument handy I don't back it up with any facts because there are none but the idea of judicial temperament as late to the game what is it that the Democrats hope to achieve by throwing this down good evening to\nGood evening John well what they want to achieve with every single aspect of their strategy with respect to Kavanaugh is delay so the more issues they can raise the more things that need inquiry into the more witnesses that needs to be\nA deposed or interviewed\nThe more they can argue that this needs to be pushed back in time and the ultimate objective here of course is to push it back beyond the midterm elections in the Democrats hope that they will\nTake over the Senate take control of it and then be able to defeat Kevin ... on the numbers\nSo the judicial temperament argument is just noise that it it doesn't come does it actually just or did they just makes us up\nWell they didn't make it up I mean they're they're reacting to Kavanaugh's\nA very uh ... indignant at times passionate spirited defense of himself and his honor which is not only been smeared\nAnd dragged through the mud but I I Believe if you um\nIf you look at what some of the things that have been set about cabinet I mean they've actually called him a serial rapist on absolutely zero evidence the ... even as the ... the case against him is collapsing for want\nOf any corroboration or verification these outlandish uh and and it really smearing\nA awful things that they've said about him continue to ring in the air so he reacted to that as any normal person would react to it\nOr they regard that as an temper it I thought it was actually quite temporary under the circumstances I mean I guess uh you know Aristotle would would remind us that we have temper for a reason right so the the question is what is it for and if it's not for occasions like that I don't know what it's for\nThat is\nAlso plays a part in our last seems to bring into the arguments about\nThat he drinks too much despite any corroborating evidence of grass actually the case there is this is part of an overall peace or they're looking for things now in addition to just will temperament anything like an anger head on to extend their sort of try to swear Republican broke\nYeah I think that's exactly right of course I'd like to to sway Republican votes and they've seen in the case of a Jeff Flake who collapsed after say he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nUh it turned into a vote with the caviar to delay when he was accosted in an elevator by what turned out to be to a hard left progressive activists so they have reason fatty as to to think that it works\nSo why not do it but I I Do think that while they hope to collect Republican votes along the way they they realize that that's less likely than the strategy of delay which Republicans unfortunately of bought into\nHow does the allegation of had drinking in college work for judicial temperament or is this completely separate uh allocation\nWell I I don't they haven't John to my knowledge tied the the drinking allegation to your digital temperament and I guess we should tell our listeners that in terms of judge Kavanaugh the allegation of a lack of judicial temperament is particularly absurd\nBecause unlike some nominees to the bench he's actually been on the bench for twelve years\nAnd is widely acclaimed by colleagues by people who appear before him by people who've worked for him or as one of the most a civil and thoughtful people to appear before a model of judicial temperament in fact a Kavanaugh's very diverse\nStable of law clerks is coveted by a not only are members of the bar but also by the Supreme Court he has sent more\nUh clerks to the Supreme Court ah than virtually anybody at his experience level so you know the idea of all the things to attack a\nTo attack Kavanaugh for judicial temperament would you would think would be the least\nLikely a I think that's an outgrowth of a ... the fire with which she reacted to the ... marching of his honor at the hearing the drinking allegation I think is because they won't dare\nTo his face at least while he's sitting there suggests that he actually committed sexual assaults in was a serial\nRapist or one of the arguments they want to make is that they think that his\nDenials of this are very a credible and passionate but perhaps he had a drinking problem and committed rapes that he forgot I suppose a the idea being that is a you know his his mind may not have been in it but it is but his body was\nIt's it's absurd but you know anything that might get traction will be tried it out here that is or anything they\nCan put in the press this was a better prepared for low point for me to uncovering or any confirmation hearings\nFor such a crazy on their part to do this or question than Andy is what's going to happen now and we're just going to continue to see this the allegations accusations anything they can put in a cramped joined a portrait or input at the end of the day there should be a vote shouldn't there one way or another\nYeah there has to be a vote that he is and what that means is that eventually the Republicans are going to have to have the gumption and the number is to simply say enough is enough you know we have to keep reminding ourselves that\nConfirmation proceeding is not a trial it's not a counterintelligence investigation it's not designed to to do a full blown criminal investigation and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody's engaged in misconduct it's actually not even an executive branch function it's the Senate\nThe ... of exercising the advice and consent tower the FBI's\nRole is just to support that it's not a normal FBI function in fact\nUh if you think about it there was no FBI until Nineteen away so the Senate was confirming\nA judicial nominees for over a century without any assistance from the FBI the thought that the the the Congress needs the executive branch performance a constitutional function is absurd and I think that you know Senator McConnell who runs the Senate\nOr as long as the Republicans have majority have said that they are

So reminding people down the street is still that's right yeah November six we still need your vote I vote and everything and of course oh I'll keep reminding yourself how they vote and vote for John Steinbeck\nWho held this seat for sixteen years in fact he was with us on election night John was\nAnd we were here covering all the different races we were here to quarter past midnight John who still hanging in there with with Bill Newman in Montana myself he talks about the day that he was sworn in your family's there and we'll come from all over the country just to see you sworn in on the day\nThat day one and then there comes a day to and you know what the hell do you do you know and it was a little bit confusing\nI Know you've got a little bit a leg up because you understand how the legislature works but what does date to look like ridiculous to me that you got to get\nBut yeah we gotta get through November sixth and then now there's no there's no instruction manuals I'm lucky right now we've got a great group of freshmen legislators coming in together\nAnd so we're already talking a lot and emailing and getting together and\nMaking sure that we're ready to hit the ground running lucky also that John ... is still around and it's so supportive you know he he is such a great job for the sixteen years and\nHe he quickly turned that oh no what do I do into some real hard work and some real great work and he was such a good job of representing all four towns had really getting around the district and also going back and forth to Boston and making sure we were hurt and\nSo I've been talking with him a lot too and I continue to do that if everything goes well November six he's going to be sick of me by November seventh and eighth\nBut it's been great he's been able to answer my questions and he now he's got a couple of things he really cares about that aren't finished yet so he also wants to hand those off and kind of\nYou know we've been really well represented here going back to my grandfather in the seventies eighties and she ended up Brian and Nancy flavor and and ... we've been so well represented in this area that we have big shoes to fill but I'm excited to to do the hard work and to get it done\nBut I I Know that the delegation of western mass delegation is usually a close knit bunch Steve kill look and John ... of this story for many many years have you reached out to a ... for instance and ... do you expect to have that same close knit relationship that ...\nYup as soon as the primary was over there was a big email chain started with all of us and Joe come up for it even as well when when we get together we got to get together we're going to try to get all of us together with Paul markets his lips and you know a whole bunch of western mass people and really learn from each other and so we're ready to hit the ground running\nA ... gun he's great guy he's a great legislator\nI'm now let's get down to the most important thing to Dan Kerry as you know this is going to be pulling the phone to where I play pong upon edging in East Hampton I go for twelve hours from seven AM to seven pm on October twelve and we had most every politician in the area who joined us last year we expect being carried to be there this year which your game\nYou know in high school it was pretty good you're not until I tried to get fancy if I tried to put a spin on the ... tried to go above my ability that's when I was it but if I get to stay focused it could be a pretty good game back yeah okay I've heard other a legislature\nBrag to sell them to go skiing rose who was actually I Do and he's only going to serve the one term not defending the seat but he went in with the basically the same attitude is use it and he came you gain a we went to tie break tie break tie break it ends up like thirty to twenty eight and was the final score\nAnd this was early in the day I mean that took their most everything I had\nTold ours is a long time to go you're going to give you the same the same thing out of you had a table grown up right oh yeah yeah I feel like I had one in my basement and all my buddies had one in their basement and their garage and we spend a lot of time playing but\nAgain that's when I was in high school as a few years ago after one up I Know you've been practicing throughout the U.S off the table and like my high school has been torn down\nActually if you look at it anymore to actually quite good right now of course was that a sad day was in when it got to hunt down it was that this time come yeah you know everyone was right in\nThe new high school is so beautiful and they did send every job that it's real fun actually going through there now and seen the pride that students have in that building and they make sure they really keep it clean and and I respect it which is awesome\nIn fact I I'm going to East Hampton high today because I have to pick up my grandson Calvin because he's my sparring partner and so I'm picking them up but right at that school gets out and we're going over to ... to\nPlay for an hour or so like ping pong legs I had to get over there that day I don't want you to have home field advantage I taught I taught a course a little different there than down in the basement rooms of spreading your wings you really do have some\nRoom and it's a it's a much different game than you would play in the basement so so I might have an edge I don't know\nIt's great that we've got that there who would aside and growing up in East Hampton I didn't know we'd have a ping pong cul de dum de ... it's great so I'll put you down October\nTwelve course we're raising money for refugees refugees who settled in the area and the courses you know to the Trump is reduced the number and there's only ... allow thirty thousand refugees there to twenty twenty two point five million refugees in in the world in war torn region and now he's going to allow thirty thousand and so you wonder what the future is but\nWe had to do whatever we can to help and yeah and then it would be playing the same time but it that's how it is time sounds like fun I've got I've got a pencil you know for October twelve or a day and Kerry\nWho is still running still running for the ... second district he faces Donald ... in November but he won the primary against John Hunt and Marie McCourt and so we'll probably see the next time it'd be October twelve so\nAbsolutely looking forward to it I'll be practicing in between for ... to carry thanks for coming and thanks for having\nSix twenty seven here on our Monday morning our number here by the way is foreign three five six seven one for zero or when three five six seven four zero called me right now if you would like to go to the right

International Monetary fund managing director Christine Lagarde is ringing alarm bells about the health of the world economy saying growth may have plateaued after last year's upswing\nThe guard says risks have begun to materialize as growth becomes less synchronized with fewer countries taking part in the expansion\nShe blamed in part global trade was for the slowdown\nDaimler CEO ... says he wouldn't rule out an expansion of the Mercedes Benz engine plant a Tuscaloosa, Alabama to meet a local content requirements in the wake of the new free trade deal between the U.S Mexico and

not as weird as what's going on in the national league yesterday and I know it jeeze that's nuts\n... the the cubs last so now they they got to do or die a game with the the Rockies run\nYeah to games at home um you know in a row for Chicago yeah they ... you know they lose that um I think what is that the first time since Seventy eight that there's been\nA one game playoff to decide a division like that it is I I'm not I'm not totally sure but I think it is you know you don't see it already often I I'm an yeah two of them in one day which is just crazy\nAnd of course then you have to blow your pitching so you're you're pictured rotations going to be all screwed up when you get into the to the Syria probably mean pretty much I guess\nThat's I guess that's the red Sox rewards for winning a hundred and eight games they they get to just rest everybody for a week and you know set up the way it exactly the way they want you\nKnow it comes to going with on the left hander a course of the former Red Sox ace Jon Lester oh he's still going strong I I kinda thought when the red socks on loaded him and Epstein grabbed him for the cubs I'd go to somebody who's on his way out for me and he gets stronger every year\nNo doubt and he just we want it too much money from the red Sox and I wonder you know what are they uh if if they regret that I mean they basically you know traded Jon Lester for David Price a new so yeah I guess it worked out for both teams\nIt looks like the rotation say the Yankees getting if the Yankees uh it ended up a a beating the Asian and they get in with the rest of our it looks like they were very strategically uh gotten around David Price starting at Yankee Stadium looks like they've got the rotation set up the price will start game too\nBut yeah at Fenway so he doesn't do so well it used to him he just the ... I think what it takes them out of the stadium right [laughter]\nWell it's you know I mean and the fact of the matter is I mean he earned it here in the number two slot you know no I don't think anybody is better than he did since the all star break so um you know with a with a minor hiccup here and there\nBut no it it definitely worked out well for him and so what he'll he'll only get one start in that in that series deserve it those five games Sal probably get starting game five\nAnd write a gateway are\nRight we have and yeah we we waited all season for it I mean you know for crying out loud\n[laughter] it's funny how they spread things out now to your play every single day or the sees it all year long you know when it gets into the really cold frigid weather news spread it out\nRight you know you gotta ah it's all it's all about the TV money\n[laughter] seems like it was never made any sense to me anyway these game starts so late you have to wonder if anybody is actually there at the end watching all your commercials but\nNot a well I guess there's you know there were they were on the east coast so you know we are we're off to see the uh the latest but I mean you know the central gets that extra our mountain west gets the couple so ... you know there's a there's plenty of people in Los Angeles watching the um watching that but the eight o'clock game I mean\nThe returns or ruin you have no doubt Scott Cohen is with us our Tuesdays with Scotty are Julian Edelman returns after a four game suspension or to the patriots who of course have to play Thursday night purple after playing on a Sunday at the ... that's ridiculous\nIt's actually it's a kind of\nIt and I know the the players aren't happy about it and I and the you know quite frankly I don't blame them um yeah that's that's a really quick turnaround to try and uh you know get your body back in shape and prepare for another team but like you know like we set up a minute ago which you know it's all about the money so [laughter]\nYou know I mean Tom but listen buddy Tom Brady is not getting any younger\nNo no no no um he loves element of course and he talks about how he gets open so quick he's got that explosion is where he can just turn on a dime when he's running his route and boy there's nobody like him I mean well I guess I Am a dog was like him but uh you know if it's a tough kid element\nYeah and again they got the kid from um the kid from ah Cleveland played his first game on Sunday he looked good news so yeah so it uh I you know I think there are certainly reason for optimism they you know they they came back and looked like the patriots old against Miami so I think that they're trying they're definitely trending up\nWhat's wrong with our world yeah before I let you go Scott calling did you see any of the Monday Night football with the Kansas City chiefs and the ...\nI Can't say that I did\n... years you've seen them in action of pat and I have yes God he's the real deal the\nReal deal yes he is they work they they said he's not Tom Brady and he's not um [noise] uh he's not a a Rogers among Green Bay but they say that he's he's John Elway and I really want to pursue for athletic and a great little quarterback\nI've never seen anybody throw on the run like that I watched the ... well I was in at all but I watch a little bit of the first half\nAnd uh you can see these got it then I got picked up the highlights this morning and my God he uh he can twist his body in such a way that he can really get a lot on at one nobody else can do that Brett Farr comes to mind is someone who could really run like that and then get rid of the ball fast but uh yeah he's good and\nAnybody source when end up in traction if we drive at the very idea of it\nEven with all with football I don't think I get to a ... he had one play last night where he um he's running of course they've got a trap and he throws the thing left hand he's a write in accord about he throws the past left handed and gets it to his\nGuys kind of a very creative type ... so no doubt no no no no question and and then when he was on full display on national TV I I got a chance to watch them made amazing yeah he was a beautiful thing to watch so he's a lot of little Brady coming out of here you got a whole bunch of little Brady who could really throws a\nYellow you

question why is this is an attorney Tony helpless\nShore on October ninth or a week from today I Believe uh five thirty PM at Pope Francis preparatory high school in ... at five thirty were going to be holding a candlelight vigil in support of victims of clergy abuse\nThe reason we're doing it there and then is because at that a high school the clergy is going to be meeting a to determine our response to clergy abuse we have not been invited\nTo that meeting though we would very much like to have been so we are going to hold in support of the victims a candlelight vigil outside\nThe high school you say the perjury is meeting ... what does that mean who can you tell us more than ... who is meeting and what the call for the meeting was whites come about\nSo as we understand it the bishop of the diocese of the United states uh Springfield a greater Springfield is asking for this meeting to and has asked all of the parish priest and hierarchy of the of this area in western Massachusetts to come so that they can have a dialogue about\nUm the most recent allegations of a pre sexual abuse that came out of Pennsylvania\nAnd we don't know the exact agenda and we would love to be able to be involved and be part of the conversation but\nAs we understand it right now it's just the clergy that are being indicted so are we made a decision that a prayer vigil are not a protest not a demonstration but a vigil that uh would really focused on a praying for the victims of clergy abuse I'm praying for transparency in the church\nAre praying for the involvement of more laity and decision making roles within the church would be something that would be really valuable to us um and I just wanted to quit politically correct I think a saint Francis preparatory school in Springfield not ticket me\nYour perspective shows so stay with a or B Jordan for men\nI don't know that they're reconcilable [laughter] I I think that um there are a lot of bishops arch bishops cardinals who have a tremendous amount to answer to [noise] I think that um power\nHas in many ways corrupted some of these individuals I think that um you know when these these issues have been around for a while and I think way back in two thousand two in the whole Boston scandal broke\nAnd they did make some changes in terms of um requirements for a you know a background check and all of that and I think that the allegations that have surfaced over the last\nFew months are really ones that still date back many years\nUm I don't find it reconcilable I Can't make excuses for those in the church to of allowed this to happen I just have to continue to believe that there are very good people who want to have it changed and want to be able to make some\nSome inroads in the church to really make a difference in people's life\nLet me turn from Margaret joined the jury's the corner and ask you the same questions and more specifically you've talked about giving the church another chance what's that mean exactly\nWell for me that means being more active and trying my best to make the team um and I don't have a lot of hope that it's going to hang on and I\nHonestly am not sure that I have a lot of hope that it's changed with me but if I don't I I'm\nJust change it involves doing something about the mirror her male hierarchical structure of the church is that what you're looking for at least in part\nI'll speak for myself I'm On this one I think there are a lot of money I think at that\nYou need to have more in the leadership and the church I think that we need to\nChange the hierarchy I think all people need to be able to be heard and seen in a church and but that's not a whole culture that\nNeeds to get 'em in a big big way and it will take a lot of work that I think that there are a lot of people out there sticking with it that you made and that will will fight for that\nWe're going to say we're going to take a quick break when we come back we're

that that may also hurting the ghetto something else to scrap\nYes for people that are self employed no employees who the hot ticket right now is what's known as a solo four O. one K. are self

gets a better four O. one K. than a two hundred person company and that has changed\nSo it's because for the cello are self employed four one K. the rules were so streamlined that you can go\nTo any of my really low cost companies that I Love\nAnd open a self employed four one K. and use their absolute lowest cost investments\nTo go in that self employed four one K. and the limits are very high for the money and put in the advantage of the ... though is there is no paperwork I mean it's like half a page and your husband in a year that things go really well can contribute roughly a quarter\nOf his revenue to the south and the year that money's tight he doesn't have to contribute at all and it just instantly becomes this up essentially becomes a regular IRA just with much more

All right and it's an issue that wanted to see how that can be guided by law though\nOh is either either can be done with the robo investing excellent\nYeah it's just the robo investing organization would have to offer\nA self employed or or a solo four one K. okay okay so if you went to like Charles Schwab to do it with Charles Schwab has something called intelligent portfolios\nWhere I'm based on your husband's agents situation you pick a portfolio and they handle the mix of investing for you it's a a free version of robo investing\nOkay and he could do the self employed are so low four one

Howard show how Charles how are you doing\nJust fine how are you great thank you you're giving advice to a family member is that true or friend\nWell advice but also just hoping to make arrangements myself and\nStumbled into a challenge trying to help someone to get a rental car out of state um there's seems to be a few places where you can pre paid for cars but in almost all cases they require you to present the card that you use to repay rental at the rental desk when you pick it up\nWe wait so you're renting a car you're paying for it but somebody else is going to be driving the car and a whole nother state\nRight trying to help an analog get to a town of Christmas for example and just was\nAnd you're asking to climb a a hill that it's going to be very hard to climb [laughter]\nThree is not set up for that because of all the problems that they have with stolen\nCars right and so all so you would be taking on an enormous liability risk\nIf you are a renter of record in someone else's an additional driver so the whole purpose of this is to get this individual to you is it cheaper than having them fly 'cause usually flying is cheaper when\nIt's when we're trying to to get several people now having children and and Christmas gifts from all of that so what car would probably be the easiest [noise] uh I don't know if it matters but\nI'm I was actually looking into renting it in their name with them being the rent or just trying to fill up eight the transaction\nBut even in that case they have to present a card to the rental agency now the the way that I could think of so they have no credit card is that right\nThey do but it just ... they don't have a lot of room on their cards so I mean\nYou're you're trying to help 'em out you're going to pay for it right okay so that's how you do it right so what you\nDo is instead of trying to rent it on your card or anything like that you make a pre payment on their credit card so that they go into a negative balance so they have a room available on their credit limit right\nWhatever the estimate of the rental is going to be and then they have the room on the\nCard to rent it with their cart gotcha\nBut then you eliminate the liability risk that you make in my heart beat too fast [laughter]\nI understand that's a good idea I should have thought of that that's that's pretty straightforward\nAnd so you don't want to pay the credit card company too far in advance of when the rental is going to be because some credit card companies as we've had caller say if you over pay or whatever that they\nThey send you a check for it but if you go to like ten days out that should work perfectly gotcha and allow the relative to rent the car\n... well that that does not like the solution I appreciate the help\nAll right well you have a great day and a great holiday ... to ... park David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nO clock how ya doing\nGreat thank you you are a Nissan Leaf driver\nYes I Am actually and um there's this great car\nSo let me tell you the deal I bought it when they had a really good rebate on it and all that actually at least it for two years now coming up on the end of the lease I at this point the cars essentially cost me nothing because the government tax credits pretty much paid for the lease payment to this point so I I Want to buy the car\nOr the problem I'm having as it's worse on the open market probably seven thousand Seventy five hundred dollars and the residuals Fifteen thousand to question number one is I Will do I do watch good woman's I give you something thousand dollar\nExactly what it's called actually because they don't want your ... back\nSo you go to 'em and you offer um market value and if Nissan tells you to get lost that it's Fifteen thousand or nothing you say I'm going to get lost here's your car back\nAnd then leave says you've seen are widely available and they use vehicle market for six to eight thousand dollars depending on the mileage and the year and the condition and you just turn around and and buy another one by used one\nRather than have one that you have known and driven from the two years it'd be better if you could buy the one you have David 'cause you know its history you're the one who created that history\nRight so that's the other side of it you always say when you buy used car get it checked out by mechanic but [laughter] where do you go to find a link mechanic they don't you don't do anything because you know there's there's simply no maintenance on the electric\nCars are the only thing you would have a leaf checked out for his best I can tell is the remaining battery life you know that meter on the right hand side where show right filled empty he'd want to attract that and the other thing is you'd want to have it checked out by a body shop\nTo see if it had been in Iraq other than that you'd be good to go because as long as the the battery has not degraded too much and it hadn't been in Iraq\nIt's just a matter of which color leave you want to drive and by ultra cheap you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nFood cars close funded by and not so hard life

Berger your advice is well taken\nIn by the way it was really really generous of you to help her pay off some of those debts\nOh well I'm not sure if you want to go on strike [laughter]\nIt was still generous no matter how you cut it to heart Mary's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Mary\nHow are you I'm from plastic ... good how can I be of service do you well I resigned\nFound a job I had a knack for quite a lifetime I'm ... years old and pretty much sums up my four oh one K. feel pretty send them out when I left it was close to a thousand\nCongratulations\nOh thank you thank you so I'm I'm currently getting ready to get back into the job market on that kinda ... you can really do anything about that far away Kaye and ... one year mark and I'm pretty sure that the one year mark I tell them or something like you\nDo not you have to do nothing so when you have that size of money and a four O. one K. and a former employer or you can leave it there forever if you wish\nRight but they going to start charging fees\nOr do they charge you the same fees they charge you if you were employed there okay there's no difference to the wall discriminating against people that were former employees the law was changed\nAnd unless you have a very small remaining balance in four one K. in which case they would cash you out and voluntarily with the amount of money you have an eighty thousand you can stay in that play on forever or if you go to your new place of employment\nAnd congratulations on your new job by the way\nIf they have a great four one K. you can move the money from the old employer into the new employers four one K. if you wish okay you also have the option if you wish at some point you can move it from the old employer's plan into your own IRA\nBut if the old employer offers a low cost four one K.\nI wouldn't want you to leave the money there unless you are new employer had lower costs four one K.\nWell then I guess my question is how do I know it's a low cost for a while\nYou have to tell you okay even as a former employee they have to tell you\nSay you can call the administrator you on your statement it'll show a number\nThat you can call the administrator and say I need to know what I'm paying in administrative costs and investment fees for having the four o one K with you and you want those low cost four one K. plan all in will cost you less than one half of one percent per year\nLess than one half of one percent right okay\nSo uh that's the standard that you should judge the planned by and if the costs are higher than that then you start thinking hey this isn't so good and if it's above one percent all when then it's a complete rip\nOkay and that's when you'd want to look potentially a one of my low cost choices that I have a my investment guide you could move your money too or if you're a new employer offers a low cost plan then you move the money\nBut if you're old employer how big a company where you will for those Fifteen Years\nIt was a global company like Enron and just over ... out a place\nSo that many employees it would be surprising if the costs you were paying or even as high as half a percent\nWell it's an barrier thing like ...

of the newly combined social justice commission of north him based Elizabeth St Louis and seen parish in our lady of the hills parish and hidden bill to recent quarter is a social worker graduated Smith MSW program\nAnd also a member of the joint commission Hussein who was an seat in ... in our ways of the hill parish in Hayden bill as is Margaret Jordan\nWho's the vice president viability nonprofits social service agency as I said she too is part of this joint commission they are here today because there is an important event happening in the valley so let's start with the event if we could\nI'm happy to have any one of you tell our listeners what the event is before pointing at Anthony so ah and singer dinner please tell us about that and then we're going to get to the really important question why is this event occurring Tony helpless\nShore on October ninth or a week from today I Believe ah at five thirty PM at Pope Francis preparatory high school in chicken pie at five thirty were going to be holding a candlelight vigil in support of victims of clergy abuse\nThe reason we're doing it there and then is because at that a high school the clergy is going to be meeting or to determine our response to record you abuse we have not been invited\nTo that meeting that we would very much like to have been so we are going to hold in support of the victims a candlelight vigil outside\nThe high school you said the ... meeting ... what does that mean who can you tell us more who ... who is meeting and what the call for the meeting was whites come about\nSo as we understand it the bishop of the diocese of the United states uh Springfield a greater Springfield is asking for this meeting to end has asked all of the parish priest and hierarchy of the of this area in western Massachusetts to come so that they can have a dialogue about\nUm the most recent allegations of a pre sexual abuse that came out of Pennsylvania and we don't know the exact agenda and we would love to be able to be involved and be part of the conversation but\nAs we understand it right now it's just the clergy that are being indicted\nSo uh we made a decision that a prayer vigil\nA not a protest not a demonstration that a vigil that uh would really focus on\nA praying for the victims of clergy abuse and praying for transparency in the church are praying for the involvement of or laity and decision making roles within the church would be something that would be really valuable to us um and I just wanted to quit politically correct I think a saint Francis preparatory school in Springfield activity\nI I just have the hardest time reconciling those too and maybe they're not reconcilable but I Would appreciate your perspective shoes or stay with a more of a Jordan for him and\nDon't know that they're reconcilable [noise] I I think that um there are a lot of the ships are bishops cardinals who have a tremendous amount to answer to\n[noise] I think that um power has in many ways corrupted some of these individuals\nI think that um you know when these these issues have been around for a while and I think way back in two thousand two in the whole Boston scandal broke\nAnd they did make some changes in terms of um requirements for a you know a background checks and all of that and I think that the allegations that have surfaced over the last few months are really ones that still date back many years\nUm I don't find it reconcilable\nWho's in the church to of allowed this to happen I just have to continue to believe that there are very good people who want to have it changed and want to be able to make some some inroads in the church to really make a difference in people's lives\nLet me turn from Margaret joined to choose a quarter and ask you the same question and more specifically you've talked about giving the church another chance what's that mean exactly\nWell for me I mean being more and trying my best to make it um and I I don't have a lot of hope that going to gain\nHonestly I'm not sure that I have a lot of hope that it's changed with me but if I'm\nJust change it involves doing something about mirror her male hierarchical structure of the church is that what you're looking for at least in part\nI'll speak for me so I'm On this one I think there are a lot\nI think that that I think we need to have more money\nInto the leadership and the church I think that you change the hierarchy I think\nAll people need to be able to be heard and seen in the church and but that's not the whole culture neat I'm In a big big way and it will take a lot of work but I think that there are a lot of people are\nStill sticking with it that you made and that will will fight for that\nWe're going to take we're going to take a quick

rotation\nTwo of them left under mysterious and unexplained circumstance is one of them the first one above a priest\n'em and was announced that he was going to ah he was leaving because of health reasons\nOr which could be true which could be true but the fact that nothing was said it was understood that people were going to priests were going to be taken away we were going to have a new priest was not going to be questioning period there was not going to be a period of some kind of records\nBut we ... this is sort of historically been the case do we really have greater transparency now I think that's one of the questions were asking even after all that's come out and all the stories we've heard um especially lately Pennsylvania or if they're going to be a discussion about this\nAnd do we know whether the priest who left the parishes here because of health reasons or under other undisclosed the reasons that might be a legitimate weather then head assignments to other parishes in other places\nMy understanding is that in these two cases they didn't so I you know I Can't speak about that I'm a ... my understanding is they were they were sent off to the the sort of halfway houses the breeze off and were sent to um sometimes for rehabilitation and sometimes for retirement\nThat of course is a major part of the story that came out with the Boston uh scandals involving the breezes that\nThey were sent to this place where this institution were allegedly they would be rehabilitated but it doesn't seem that this institution to which there was an issue we both hated anyone or certainly very very very very small percentage of those who are under\nA truce a quarter or Margaret ... during can you\nHelp us understand this a little better maybe perhaps toss that your experience\nThey asked me to change if it's going to come has to come from the bottom up in one of the purposes behind this\nVigil were holding next week is to say you know watch if the hierarchy is not going to act\nIn a definitive church changing way it's going to have to come from the people who go to church every week who stuck with it who still believe in it so it's nice to believe that a pope can change everything but a pope can't change anything we all know that he's dealing with battles within the Vatican people who are trying to undercut\nHim all the time it's us who have to do something and this is the beginning let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me out of there you go to one of the more beautiful him of the mass uh things\nTruce a quarter your view\nYou know in that question this reminds me a lot of that's how I often feel put put like about Pope Francis how I felt about Obama I'm In two thousand eight I just I feel so hopeful when I hear them speak of and then sometimes the changes are slow and I think\nUh that has a lot to do with what Tony said that we can't rely on them to lead us I mean I think that the tide of what's gotten us into this you know trusting that the hierarchy is going to do all the right things and that we can just followed them Margaret Jordan [noise]\nI agree with everything that they said I think um when you have a two thousand year old history of the church and making major change that's been entrenched now for Fifteen hundred of those two thousand years um I think it's very very difficult and I do believe that uh that Pope Francis\nHas the spiritual ability has the ability to be able to a shape people's thinking I think that he has already been trying to\nA shake up to church with a a lot of us in cycles and writings that I think he has inspired a lot of non Catholics as well with his\nWith his thinking but again Tony ... said that there is a huge hierarchy in road\nI'm very very conservative group of cardinals and bishops um who I think are in some ways trying to undermine him and I think he has his work cut out for him but I feel like if there's anyone that can make change\nI think it's it's Pope Francis I'm On the other hand I think that from you know little that I read his ashamed of all of this and I think he's having a really difficult time from what I understand\nBeing able to think about how to create the change that needs to happen in in the wake of all these allegations\nWe've just about a minute left but I Would like to ask you this does the archdiocese of Springfield meet the necessary criteria for being transparent and open and accessible to Catholics in the area\nBecause I was a good hot yet\nAnd the other and the other comment is that we're going to leave that as the
