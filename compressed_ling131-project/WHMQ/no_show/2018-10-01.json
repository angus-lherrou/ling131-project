but now now we're seeing the entire process pushed out at least another week because Jeff Flake Republican allegedly from Arizona decided that he would cave in having originally said I'll vote for cabin on the Senate floor\nAnd I thought that good move coworkers come on board now flights come on board I think we are going to get this done and then flake had an elevator encounter with a political activist who talked him into were persuaded him to go back into the committee and say now tell you what\nI Want to I Want to make this conditional we need to have one week just one week of FBI investigation if you believe\nThat it's only going to be one week then you haven't been watching what the Democrats have been doing\nThey had been trying to string this process out as long as possible and I believe this strategy really goes all the way back to July to the month that President Trump nominated judge Kavanaugh\nAnd Democrats immediately announced almost all of them a few exceptions said we're going to vote against him no matter what before they even heard from judge Kavanaugh\nThey were already decided that they will vote against him and even today Democrats are still saying we're going to vote against them but we want is fully investigated but it'll just take a week\nI don't believe that for a second I Believe the FBI will be open to fairly quickly go back and re interview Kavanaugh re interview Christine forward after they already testified under oath yesterday then you've gotten mark judge the alleged second teenage male in the room\nAt the time that Christine forward says that Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her\nHe's already submitted a letter under penalty of perjury to the Senate committee saying none of this stuff happened so to be interesting to see what if anything new\nThe FBI might develop isn't prudent for Donald Trump to have a backup nominees since run it was like Jeff Flake continue to stand the wait no I don't think he should he does have a long list of possible judges but if he shows any weakness whatsoever\nYou know what the Democrats wanted to do is push this out toward the election\nRemember we're already at the end of

seven five ... be [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to the Lars Larson we've been spending a lot of time this week talking about the uh Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd what's going to happen with it and now having expected it to go from the committee to the Senate floor and for a confirmation that happened in the early part of next week instead it's going to be pushed off at least a week because of a rather flaky US Senator from Arizona though I'm not exactly but I never was a big fan of and now even less\nI thought we'd talk about that with conclude ... who is legal editor for Breitbart News network in general counsel for the American civil rights union and the co author of resurgent how constitutional conservatism can save America\nI guess we'd have an addendum to that can that says if we can just get the justices on the court that ... was alright welcome to the program\nI was going to ask you what Gavin I was ... yeah what Kavanaugh's confirmation means for the midterms but at this point are you still confident that we can get him confirmed or the Democrats just gonna\nThis out with weak delay after week delay until they get to November\nOr I Am confident that we're going to have him confirmed that the timeline that\nI and others are associated with the effort worked back then\nWas we were expecting him to be confirmed sometime around closest is less on Tuesday October second and then to add on thinking it'll probably be a the afternoon or evening out friday October five\nMaybe they push it into that second week of October but we're moving to all the procedural hurdles that we had to get through any ways that started today\nWith Mitch McConnell are putting forward that the motion to proceed so if we if we have managed to invoke cloture come friday then as soon as the FBI comes back\nAnd says we have we have followed the president's order here's our supplemental report\nYou know ... the stuff that everyone was saying publicly over the past couple of weeks of that and then hopefully the Senate could move expeditiously no need for more committed to carry it out of committee now or if we could just go ahead and proceed to a final four but so I think the best case scenario\nWould be late in the day next friday so so free date flavor of the late ... and uh but uh if they have to push it back to early next week if the Democrats want to keep this issue\nHas a flood of the news issue if they want to be showing the voters in states like Indiana in Montana and Missouri and Florida and West Virginia that this is what they could expect\nIncreased by an order of magnitude if they were to take the Senate majority or ... if that's the comparison they wanna set before the American people right before the midterm elections on November sex you know more power to them\nYou know can you come to think the same way I Do because every day I invite naysayers called the show because I think the best way to strip show up the strength of your argument is to come up against some fairly formidable opponent in this case I think the Democrats have shown themselves to be\nKind of crazy I mean you have Chris Coons suggesting that the burden of proof from the accused is on the accused knocked the accuser to prove that the charges true you had a you've had one Senator Sheldon Whitehouse a suggested ... you know definitions of what the flatulence is from a high school I never\nReally embarrassed himself ...\nIf you'd think his staff talked to him about that before answering senator what are you to talk about it on and talking about before references in your book oh hey yeah\nThe the the the that that anger I mean that's some of these Democrats letters and certainly I think White House did it yesterday I mean just just the anger that was the day you know a ... in their words and in their eyes I mean it's it's that kind of hostility\nYou you know what the things about uh about our our\nBipartisan system is you know you can disagree without being disagreeable you can you can disagree on policy\nBut still recognized that your opponent is perceived in some good motives and that like you say they want\nTo to do things that will be good for people I mean it's it's the the the politics but we saw from the other side of the aisle the past few days has just been so vilified in so angry and sort of extreme in that regard but I think it's turning off middle America\nI'm kind of amazed that they're going to fly to conflate frankly if I'm reading this when right when he walks out of the room gets into an elevator a woman blocks to the door on the elevator and then arrange them for a few minutes and he goes upstairs and changes his mind\nI thought I was thinking out loud can about what would have happened if he got in the elevator review or Tom ...\nMore uh you know\nOr or new ... or a you know Newt Gingrich or or any one of a hundred great people what have you gotten the elevator with the conservative you might've come charging down saying one stay all weekend and getting confirmed by Monday morning instead he got he got blocked in the elevator by a liberal progressive\nWho managed to turn the guy a hundred and eighty degrees and a five minute conversation what the heck what\nWell I'll tell you a ... uh I Know that Senator Flake\nWas very much on the fence about this a ... of course uh do do not agree with with what they did today I think it's absolutely unnecessary I support uh ended up ... the word slumber Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and others that just called this whole thing a circus\nBut it just like thinks that this is necessary for purposes of credibility and if you add up Lisa Murkowski with him who knows maybe Susan Collins is well\nNow that now that that die is cast is going to play out and even though and I have to say again give me never won the benefit of better motives here even though it is not at all what I Would have done\nI have to tell you at the end of next week\nRepublicans could be sitting in a better position I won't be the right way the talking point this will take away the talking point oh they wanted to hide this from the FBI well you know what even though they didn't have jurisdiction the FBI is now investigate it and it's been investigated by the FBI what else do you have so all of these talking points that they have\nJust like it's taken away by half those talking points through this course that he has chosen to pursue so as long as she and the other's votes ... confirmed at the end of the day I think Republicans will be better off going into November sex as frustrated as this is\nI think of the tree up he'll have the last laugh on an ongoing for this\nNext targeting Kenyans feel I feel bad for judge Kavanaugh on his family having to endure another way could\nI Do too I'm Talking to conclude ... with the American civil rights union Ken I'm I tried to be the happy warrior too I mean ... I Hope it comes from the show that I'm I'm a I'm an optimistic person but what I worry about is that the FBI investigation for the Democrats\nIs like an evening when you when you have nothing better to do and you just started surfing the Web and you look at one news story and that leads you to another one and that leads to another one and I'm worried that they're going to say while the FBI is going on and talk to seven people if they can find seven people in my nose something\nI think there's only one person who actually claims to know what happened that night thirty six years ago but if they find anything else they'll say well this marriage more investigation and I'm worried the bill use that as a door opener to say well now that we've interviewed these seven\nWe're gonna have to have them go back and talk to another seven or eight people and their ultimate goal would be to push this thing off to November otherwise do they realize what idiots they're starting to look like the Democrats by saying we're not going to vote for him anyway but we demand that you thoroughly investigated him\nWell I have no doubt that they're going to try to do exactly that ah I'm extremely thankful that uh that they are not in charge of the Senate and they're not in charge with the FBI so Jeff Flake could have been more clear in his surprise statement today\nThat he wanted no more than seven more days of investigation and limited only to the accusations that are on the table as of this moment and that that was President Trump's quarter to the FBI was to investigate exactly that and to conclude their investigation with him\nIt's talk so what's the other day I don't doubt that Democrats are just a couple of other excuse to try to get this closer to getting past the nature of the largest but at this point like thinking I Hope\nThat uh that sort of like yeah look up in college or get let's say you know what\nWe want the extra mile when he had left which state here that was all of these ... this is true extra bottles which kitten you if you're the spoils of war that accommodated and now even worse satisfied just little forward to confirm that's good that\nIf we don't get this man on the court and if the president has denied perhaps another pick before the end of his first term uh we could lose some of our civil liberties are and and decisions will come down in a very different way from the Supreme Court than they would have so this is this is for all the ... and a lot of ways\nOh yes I agree and I'm with you ... you can't overstate the case that this was a fight for liberty or I just wish the Republicans with practice some of the things that they do they use on their own\nUh and use them on the Democrats you know I wrote an op ed piece this this week that that uh the highlights that nobody's got the moral high ground when it comes to the character ... spears especially falsely but what we on the Republican side tend to do is focus on each other\nAnd that we don't use it for a the Democrats I mean just think about the day\nWhen the when Jeff Flake who I think a ... ... exactly the wrong thing or in a in caving in a after the committee votes to send Kavanaugh's named to the floor of the Senate after he did that Lindsey Graham who gave us a strong fiery speech against these tactics\nAnd there are any Republicans to vote to vote against cabin on legitimize these tactics because we can't let it stand\nToday after the ... the Mr\nGray was Dr ... or ... as if it was the day before yesterday and say well you know we've gotta we've gotta play ball with them and we've got to give them a chance to\nTo let this happen or when just yesterday he was a adamantly opposed to that the Republicans I've got to learn how to fight the that's why\nA lot of the establishment candidates ended up getting beat a in surprises like when Dave Brat a beat Eric Cantor yup uh and uh and it continued is going to continue to happen\nAnd and the worst thing that could happen with this is that their base which was all fired up yesterday and I'm One of them I was excited yesterday to see the outcome a and to see Mr cab and I'll take these these people on because they're animals they were being vicious\nAnd filthy and nasty to him and his family and still are as a matter of fact but to\nTo to allow that to continue now onto the floor vote and put this is a charade of uh FBI investigation or in the place uh is only going to\nEncourage the Democrats and the other side and I guarantee you there will be at least one if not two or three\nA surprise accusations that are just as outlandish as the ones that came out earlier this week and and and quite frankly you know I'm Glad they gave doctor for the opportunity to speak in state her case and those kinds of things that we should do that\nOr will we have a situation like this but there are still do corroborating evidence and and and in our justice system you can't just go on a he said she said an emotional pleas that sounds good and looks good\nYou got to have evidence to support at one way or the other and all the evidence is on the air on judge Kavanaugh side at this point so we can't let these tactics than\nNo we can and I guess to some extent we've got to have a Republican Senate twice the backbone of Democrats\nBecause when Democrats say absolutely outlandish ludicrous things and here's an example from this week Senator Chris Coons member of the Democratic party announced that the burden of proof to prove the charges were not true is on judge Kavanaugh\nNow colonel you know this you've been a commanding officer before\nThe burden not just in criminal court and civil court\nIs always there in criminal and civil court but even throughout the rest of our system when you want to challenge something the burdens on you if you know and so if you want to say somebody hurt me and you go to civil court\nYou need to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it actually happen if you want to go to criminal court you got to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and it's the state's job to do that and if they don't prove beyond a reasonable down\nThen you don't convict a criminal and he goes free\nEven if he really is a criminal and yet here you had Chris Coons saying the burdens on the on the judge to prove he didn't do it and that's such an absurd idea but the mainstream media which would ordinarily ... respond is it a for Republicans said something outrageous not the same\nBecause Republicans don't do that um they they have been pilloried and the press forward but nobody in the mainstream media seem to care there Chris Coons was saying and he's just one example from the last week where Democrats say something crazy the press doesn't respond at all Republicans says something that's out of line and they go to town and spend a week\nTalking about how evil it was colonel Maine as I got to run but I very much appreciate you coming on as you do from

to your gym ah this is a a issue that's near and dear to my heart because I raise money for refugee resettlement in the north Hampton area impacted October twelve hours a day of my a marathon where I play ping pong for twelve straight hours uh to or were trying to raise ten thousand bucks this year for a record used it to come in the area of through Catholic charities\nUm I Know that you're appalled at what happened recently is that the Trump Administration has proposed a limit on ah nothing more than thirty thousand refugees into the country and you know only about half of those are going to be accepted\nSo each year dwindled some windows in windows you're talking about twenty two point five million ... cheese is the biggest refugee crisis in in world history we're going to keep everybody else\nYou know I'm I'm horrified look I think I I coach for the human rights commission here in Congress and I believe that the United states stands for anything we need to stand out loud and four square for human rights and you know if we stand for human rights than we are\nActions need to prove that and that means that when there are people fleeing violence in wars in natural disasters that we are as well\nAs other countries in the world become a place where\nThey can find some safe haven and we're not talking about taking the entire world's displays population and what we ought to do our part and as you pointed out you know in your opening remarks I mean we're we're living in the world\nNow where we have more refugees than any other time in in in history and uh there are\nWars and upheavals are natural disasters all over the world where you know people\nHave been displaced and um and some people are fleeing for their lives I mean we were turning away people who are coming to our\nBorder from places like Salvador and Honduras or ... terrible violence El Salvador's more dangerous today than Afghanistan right and people are wrestling with your kids trying to find some safe haven in the United states they want to\nApply for asylum but we're turning them away I I think it's awful what's going on and I uh I heard people say well you know we we we can't afford to take any more people and you know in many many people um who who come here who have come here as refugees have gone to great careers and that\nYou know are unbelievably to our country uh they've been doctors and business people and teachers and I mean I could go on and on musicians and they come here to work that's what they're going after somebody\nOr I'm hit it come here to work it to be able to raise their family I don't understand why it's become so controversial and\nYou know I think if it plays into the administration's theme\nOf you know let's beat up on immigrants are men and they don't distinguish between you know somebody who is an economic migrant versus somebody who is a legitimate refugees fleeing violence and civil unrest is you know they they pay everybody with one brush and uh I Would say\nTo you that you know within the pioneer valley area I mean you know the whole area has been enhanced by some of the refugee resettlement set of occurred over the years I just passed\nA bill you know I'm you know to try to crack down on China\nYou know for the terrible treatment of Tibetans I mean there are many Tibetans\nWho have been resettled in Massachusetts in in western Massachusetts and I think we all\nAppreciate their their presence their culture their contributions to our economy and that that that's the face of refugees I mean that those are the people who you know who are coming to this country ... many of us have relatives who came here as refugees\nFleeing World War two I mean so the violence of World War two so I I I find that appalling that um

about something that has generated a large number\nAsk clerks and we're able with the ask carts you do such a service for your fellow listener when you post a question on NASCAR at ... dot com and there was a huge up tick\nIn the number of questions about how you verify who you say you are with the credit bureaus if you put a credit freeze employees and as I shared with you just a week ago\nCredit freezes and flaws of a credit freeze are now free\nSo the credit bureaus having this be kind of like a backwater to a major part of their activity\nWere really wanting a simpler way that has upset a lot of people\nUp to last week the procedure was that you would file a request for credit freeze with a credit bureau and they would issue you\nA unique secret code\nCode was somewhere like ten to twelve digits I guess depending on the bureau\nAnd so your credit would be frozen you decide you wanted a new cell phone plan or you wanted to shop for auto insurance or you wanted to apply for a loan or whatever so you had to thaw get a new credit card you had to thaw your file\nSo you'd go onto the website of the credit bureau you'd put in your secret code to thaw\nAnd then bam you'd have access to your credit more important somebody that was pulling your credit to decide whether or not to do business with you would be able to do so were they were blocked otherwise sole purpose credit phrases to block the crook out\n'em or credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit karma so I Know she's monitoring it and trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as our

because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have a no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago\nIt's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date to try to keep something active in somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's on there that is too old she challenges with the credit bureau notify us whoever has it dated wrong that she's challenged it needs to be removed\nEnough to do that the collection agencies behave themselves\n... okay so the other thing is if she's already has credit cards of her own right now\nUm is that is that um the uh\nHer credit scores fires if I'm reporting her on line\nYeah see you added her as an authorized user on top of what she's got that will be really helpful to her as well because it will increase her available credit which will help driver score up that's one of the

didn't get that far [laughter]\nUm it it is absolutely I okay\nFor you to use acorns and have it as a path to start building up some money for you for\nFor the years and it is it's where money that

actually how're you doing I'm doing great care actually he's got a question for me let's see if I can help you with\nYes I'm I'm hiring a virtual assistant to help me with my mind mundane task touches paint dry laundry maybe groceries and things like that but it's through up Oregon I\nKnow that they're qualified people but I Want to be able to get her into the pay for something without risking credit score it filing their credit card in agreement and things like that while minimizing my rent cue\nSo you're going to give this person the ability to make payments but you want to make sure they don't destroy your credit and at the same time limit access that this individual would have to your funds\nAbsolutely\nOkay I've got something I\nAnd I've only one other time of I suggested it in a situation something like yours but it seemed to fit and it's called blue\nBird have you ever heard of a bird now if you look at ... dot com\nBeing is a payment system that is a joint venture of American Express and Walmart\nAnd so you're able to issue a bluebird account to this individual\nAnd they can do a bill payment for you they can do transactions on the card you can see every transaction is happening and here's the best part you control the flow of money into the blue bird account\nSo that you have put any did you put in it only the money that you need this assistant to have to do the transactions that you need them to pay for and take care of\nGreat that's exactly what I Am and meets the exactly my requirements I thank you\nAnd the other thing with blue bird read through all the ... all the ways it works as long as you jump through all the right hoops with blue bird you'll pay no fees at all to have this has been that count for this assistant\nPerfect\nNow you're only risk is let's say you do run into a problem with this individual and you have let's just say for argument's sake you've got three hundred dollars and the blue bird account at that time\n... and so you decide you gotta watch this person go 'cause they're not performing well or they have not proven to be trustworthy or whatever the last amount of money you have on deposit that they have access to may well be at risk\nAbsolutely so but you know you will know the amount and it would be kept by the amount that you put in there that you've trusted him with\nYes and that's a risk and willing to take up to a certain dollar value\nOkay so it is of the possibilities it's number one for what you're trying to accomplish and I hope that you find that it works well for you if it turns out\nThat were birds of bust I Need to know that so I can take that information into account next time I might talk about it\nDarren is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Darren how are you today\nGreat thanks for the political\nCertainly you want to talk about your child or children\n[noise] yeah I had a question I all of a at a test with credit freeze you are\nAnd [noise] my wife and I asked a counter frozen and wait for our daughter's\nA ... we've got a Social Security number on it but my question is why do they even have a credit files on minors or why do they even permit activity if they're not you know legally able to sign for any any anger the new account\nSo criminals are exploiting a loophole and how the three major credit bureaus do business\nSo the credit bureaus what they do is they ... they make money collecting data they make money selling data and so they build ... on\nOn anybody who anyone reports credit activity on so they didn't start off with a file on your\nYoung daughter but what happens with\nA a density theft in childhood entity theft is far more likely to occur than for an adult\nIs someone will assume your child Social Security number and they'll do it for many different reasons their favorite is it there's no history there so they'll start applying for things as if\nThey are not necessarily your daughter but using her number and so that's what creates the file with the credit bureaus and voila suddenly\nThe crook has taken over your daughter's Social Security number and potentially created a whole new identity because remember there was no pre existing record for your daughter\nSo what child credit freeze does is the credit bureau actually creates an empty file for your daughter based on\nHer name and her Social Security number and then freezes it which prevents anybody from applying for credit or doing things is if they are the holder of that Social Security number\nGot you got a credit bureaus alright cross checking the Social Security number against a birth date absolutely not because that would like to watch that\nNo that would cost them money to the credit bureaus there was no necessity\nOr even desire of the credit bureaus to be very accurate they're happy play on horse shoes clothes for them is good enough because accuracy would be expensive and it would reduce their net profits\nThirty authors and

whatever they want through a C H automated clearinghouse you need to know that your rights under the law or post static\nThat when a business or any organization takes money\nThat way it is a real

payment on a loan or something like that you go into your bell pay and you discontinue paying\nThe problem with the drafting with the AC age because you have virtually no rights is that if money is taken either by mistake or on purpose\nIt is extremely difficult to get that money ever refunded in return to you and nobody is looking out for you so use the the ability you have to protect

similar um daughters in the sense that they're both going off to college this year and they both have peanut allergy um my daughter has a life threatening peanut allergy and we started the process about Eighteen months ago and trying to\nFind the best college and the boss set for her and um I thought I was doing the right thing by going to the right channels at the university that she packed and come to find out where you know ten days from moving date and they're\nBeing inflexible in regards to the dining planet kind of how I Would see it um\nWe thought she would be able to to go to the dining hall that when she got there for orientation it was obvious that there was a lot of um\nOpportunity for cross contamination and so in a couple of days she was there for orientation she kind of grabbed a banana and one other thing from there and thought I needed something out so I'd ask to be exempt from that dining plan and they're saying no\nShe's not allowed to be eggs on campaigns and\nWe got talk here because we got a similar thing going on with my daughter and that uh for her housing assignment\nYet she had requested that that she be with a roommate that had food allergies as well four roommates say would agree to have no peanut products in the dorm room 'cause you know those dorm rooms here on top of each other\nAnd she got lost in the shuffle and she's with two roommates both of whom she's communicated with on social media both of whom are not products are very important part of their diets\nAnd so now and and we've got her advocating for herself she's been working with the school to try to get a different housing assignment and wearing count down to going as well and have a similar issue so ah on the ...\nInside what I Would do is get outside the bureaucracy of the school and they send a letter to the chairman of the board of trustees\nOkay\nAnd it's an obvious thing that no school\nAnd what goes back to it flattened or Greek and will cope rent is you know no school is\nA is ever supposed to put a student and life and death danger and it's an old legal concept and the school by being careless is doing exactly that with your daughter and isn't it is a proper thing that if\nThey can't provide a safe environment from people aren't aware\nYour daughter in mind can die almost immediately from being exposed to cross contaminated not or peanut products and it's one of those things people roll their eyes were they get a rash or something\nThey don't get it there's an F lactic shocking and\nAh instant death\nAnd so it's possible that the administrators at the school don't get the real life and death aspect of it either so I had never heard of the allergy till our child almost died one day from it and I get how dangerous it is\nSo I Would uh if you're going to advocate for her or she should be advocating for herself as well\nI Would find out who the chairman of the board is and that's who I Would immediately contact\nOkay\nStand out and get out of that there are threats what's that\nBecause I've been working with like the directors of dining and and they're simply saying well it's really up to the director of ...\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and none of whom bureaucratic mumbo jumbo and they don't care if your kid doesn't live up they don't care about that you're the one who has to carry your daughter\nHas to care about ourselves and that's why you go outside the bureaucracy and you make it now I I don't see anything wrong with calling the president of the university\nOkay were there any other advice that you have that your daughter goes off\nWell I mean if you're at or near daughter's Eighteen or Nineteen and his lived with us how long\nAbout sixteen years\nYeah so just like you know my daughter was a almost died it too so we've been fully aware of it or allergy is not lessened you know we do the tests overtime hasn't lessened\nAnd so I I feel like if they are age they're good at protecting themselves
