barriers of one kind or another\nI have a feeling that if more military help is needed Donald Trump will be selling it yes sending it in a world where bombs and harassment are commonplace oh by the way before I started into this\nChristian deals in the head of the department of homeland security is just told Fox News that violence against the border agents will not be tolerated now you can translate that any way you want but the way I see it she's sending a message that if the caravan of people's shows up\nAnd they insist on forcing their way into our country the way you can see them on YouTube forcing their way\nInto Guatemala and then out of Guatemala into Mexico if they plan that kind of rush for the border I have a feeling they're going to be met by enough force to make sure that they do not come into this country and if you don't like that look at some of the interviews and I've listened to as many as I can get my hands on her my ears on\nAnd what I'm hearing from people is I'm a hard worker I Want to go there and work or it's really a lousy economy and Honduras none of those are legitimate reasons to claim refugee status in the United states of America\nBy the way in a world where bombs and harassment or seemingly becoming commonplace one congressional candidate is worried about threats made literally and believe this against his children\nO'clock bail new map WHM paint news information and [noise]\nBeing a student read something to a class students that has completely shut down\nTo see that same student a year later standing in front of a whole room full of kids in reading something is like the best we get to see the whole little steps turned into a huge victory I mean really spend a lot of time making sure that every kid find that it's not that the child is looking successful but it actually being both challenging\nAs an organization that our main extracurricular enrichment any grandchildren\nAll about money I mean we have kids the autism can Down syndrome kids with no diagnosis we've seen students succeed in a classroom setting having been in a classroom with tears for years but also kids who are typical benefit because they leave the classes like a larger\nView of abilities that these these kids who are we didn't notice much before I have so much time every time they haven't appeared anything even anyway\nYeah any child yeah then it that we're going to hang on talking political genius unwritten ... whole children dot org this\nIs the Lars Larson show\nOne seven [laughter] somebody who may be\nGoing some bigger goal eight six six halo hours to join the conversation oh welcome back to the Lars Larson Joe's he'll be it'll be much easier to get to your phone calls and emails in just a bit of a hat or eight six six eight Lars that's eight\nSix six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com and we talk about a ... a lot about Veterans Affairs on this program because we've known as a country for a long time that the VA has\nNot delivered the kind of health care that you might expect I Know that some of ... veterans have had fantastic healthcare from the VA\nUnfortunately we've had too many veterans who literally died while waiting in line metaphorical line that is being put on a wait list somewhere and that's just not not right well I Believe that's being corrected by changing the law and buy a new ... secretary\nThe secretary Robert Wilkie has been nice enough to join us before secretary Wilkie welcome back to the program\nWell thank you large thank you for having\nUser new development in the form of an online portal that's actually going to make veterans' health care veteran ... please tell my audience about that\nYes we'll be launching in the next few weeks of the first phase of a V. A. dot Gov which will be a a place for veterans to get information on everything from health care to education benefits you know\nThe last time we have we talked about the having hundreds of eight hundred numbers hundreds of of links to different websites that that made the process of actually getting in\nTo the system almost unbearable so this is the first of a a two pronged salt\nThat we will be making on that that the second is what is going on right up there in the Pacific northwest in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a beta testing the electronic health record which will for the first time connect\nA veteran from the time that he had heard is that military processing center as a young recruit\nThe time he walks into it to be a net will revolutionize the way we provide ...\nWhy why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kinds of capabilities that you know the average or retail company out there in America has right\nWell I think laws and it's something that you you talked about for years and then you get major living on a preaching free market ideas and appreciate preaching the notion that uh if we're going to have official government if that is possible\nIt has to be closest to the people that government serves and a BA has been a typical government institution there are hundreds of thousands of good people who joined VA\nBecause they want to serve veterans but they've been held back by uh nineteenth century prophecies of regulations and a beautiful thing about where we are today is that we've got a president who does not care\nAbout what went on in the past I mean he ah I think somebody else was called the great disruptor but he certainly has when it comes to that the system and is is not going to tolerate business as\nWell and so secretary well Kerry I'm sure that some people are going to hear this is a great computers that's going to cost a bundle of money but at the end of the day does it have the potential not only to deliver great care which is what we care most about but also potentially to be more efficient and less costly than the current system\nIt it does it does in the sense that it will provide us rapid scheduling it will and this is the most important part and the president will be announcing reforms to the state of the ... in in January\nIt will and this is the most important part and the president will be announcing reforms to the state of the union in January this will be the basis for the opening of that ad but true when it comes to veterans choice and health care and that's\nThe ability of the veteran not to be tied to a system that may be ... miles and miles away from his home\nIt's going to be a system that in many cases almost all will allow that veteran to choose whether or not it's better for him to get care closer to home than in the center I'm that's what's truly revolutionary about what's coming and the beauty of that\nIs that we do have a consensus from the Congress they've given me as the secretary the authority to create this new system the president is on board\nAnd you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government a government that serves as it is singularly designed to serve or those people we are mandated to help\nWill secretary well can you tell me that's because I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like along vats to access private medical care\nFrom the system that serves the rest of us I've had veterans tell me themselves that they had good results by going that way when the VA has been willing to pay for it\nBut I Would imagine it also has the potential for some VA employees to lose their jobs you have all of a sudden you know all the local hospital the local civilian hospital is doing a lot more one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center\nThat means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that\nHave you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nRight well the president has been very clear about um the glaciers ship with with arguing and he has said\nThat there's no prerogative is no prerogative for unions or\nAny other group federal employees in general um within that prerogative comes in between a veteran and out\nAnd we have said that clearly the president has moved course we're now hung up in the courts but that's to be expected or you know we we're we're blessed with a lot of dedicated work but um [noise] we are very clear\nThat a union members who are medical professionals NBA\nIf they're going to stay they have to devote their time to taking care of patients not spending as as some do actually many\nSome nurses doctors spend a hundred percent of their time doing the work ah that's not what are the veterans expect that's not what the public expects them that's certainly not with the um the president the United states demands\nLet me ask you about something this is another issue that came up and is Nathaniel Bedford Forrest I remember that name from both you know junior high school and high school there was a portrait of that man who was a Confederate general a ... but he also became the KKK is first figurehead Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd one of your employees a deputy director of zero VA offices smaller disadvantage business utilization had that portrait up in his office but he said I didn't know that he was connected to the KKK and so they've taken this down\nYou know on one hand I understand why somebody who knows history that well might be offended\nBy on the other hand it just seems like this is where where scrubbing every bit of American history and most of our history is filled with people who would not be politically correct by today's standards do we end up scrubbing all of the history and I wanted to get your take on on on the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nOr I Will let me tell you how I was addressed it now first of all and that plays a this individual or pictures of George Washington and what have you lived in his office right\nAs soon as someone complained he took it down so there's there's no complaint with the impact he he moved it\nUm and that's what he did write I'm I'll tell you how I'll address this um when I was a for confirmation a there are several members of Congress who are demanding that Mr Lincoln's words\nFrom his second inauguration a great ... where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow in Austin or be taken down from the VA really um I actually have those ... yes and I actually have those words in my office\nAny crime after the fact it's\nThe fact it's been all in the news that is what they want to get Trump for for the non existent Russian collusion or right they are section three of the federal criminal code but but James Buckingham\nCouldn't make it to section three never got there oh it's crazy there's no way we can go after the sanctuary cities yeah it took me six seconds on Google on Google defined accessory after the fact\nWell in in you pointed out and I remember the fight we're Arizona said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona will under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least and according to one and they want under the premise that only the federal\nGovernment can enforce immigration laws and you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column and as we've pointed out before\nBut isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal citizens of the United states could bring a massive uh you know go to a case against a class action case saying we're being denied equal treatment under the law\nIf a certain class of people get to one kind of treatment under the law and American citizens get lesser treatment believe it or not\nIt's actually really great idea of one of the grounds on which it's illegal to ... to discriminate as place of birth and nationality I'm In this case I mean the assumption was discriminating against people who weren't your fellow citizens no it's just the exact\nOpposite of people who are not our fellow citizens to commit crimes are being treated better by prosecutors are less likely to be charged with charge at all or charged with ah the maximum crime they can be charged with in order to to make sure they stay here we got to keep the criminals here\nWell and and you know that there are at least a couple of places in America they are going to have a vote on this on November the six to get rid of sanctuary status and I think the voters are going to vote to get rid of it but how do we convince\nSay the New York times which thinks that it's terrible that Jeff Sessions we'd go to one of his deputies and say would you please research says and then and then the the New York times is an outrage when the deputy comes back and says no I couldn't find anything like that and the law and you find it in six seconds on Google\nIt it's it's pretty amazing but there is an element on the left ah it it's been with us for a long time ago just hate America whether they were um you know selling selling or giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union rooting for the Soviet Union\nOver our own country um to today where they are rooting for the caravan to come across they just want to destroy the country\nNow I think most elected Democrats aren't that hateful driven by a passion\nTo destroy our country but they're certainly bucked up by those people and and the position of most elected Democrats is a number one ah the the the masses of third world are pouring into our country oh look they vote for the Democrats were all for them\nAnd number two it's just gotten to the point that whatever Trump is for their against it's worth mentioning that\nNot very long ago Harry Reid Dianne Feinstein even Iraq Obama were against this influx of illegal immigrants bringing their path olive jeez I'm their poverty their medical problems to our country when we have our own people with path olive trees poverty and health problems that we need to take care of\nAnd and in fact we've been running a sound bite I mean it's it's amazing that the New York times is forgotten the great ... Hussein Obama\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully then become immigrants in this country\nI guess the editors over the old grey lady just forgot all about that happening just a couple of years ago and congratulations on the success of resistance is futile

I was drinking too much and decided to quit the booze\nNow you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plaudits that it would critics but no that was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise I guess it will depend on who it ends up is\nFor those bombs if it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname I've a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats doing something really odd and really two faced\nBecause they will say well if this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump\nWhich is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty\nWho commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all left days and you understand there is a double standard in the media about that you can cite example after example where the media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone\nAnd they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam\nBut boy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me no matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these\nBombs or devices most some of them were not active bombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is I think that CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump\nLet's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind tonight\nLarge unless they airs love yeah thank you very much shrouded\nNo problem I got I got out of a question it's becoming a cross my mind for a while with all the rhetoric cholesterol and out inciting violence and won it all to check 'em while they're down yet you go on and on all day\nDoes it ever make you wander than making me wonder are they are they ... is the last Bush in\nFor another civil war I mean they're even all of it all from other countries do you remember the\nDemocrats lost the last civil war uh\nAnd and the Republicans won and thank goodness for that uh but but are they pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today Oh yes they are now we can you watch a couple of the national Susan movies and you'll see the evidence and I have to give great credit to punish for being able to do that\nBut do they want another confrontation I think they think that's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make they demanded in September of twenty sixteen\nDonald Trump you have to say that you will accept the results of the election now that demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton\nAnd yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary if the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question\nAnd why because nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump and so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency and they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen\nThey said we can't accept this result and I've always been proud that I live in a country where\nThere's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now\nAnd we said you have an election and no matter whether you like the results are not you accept the new president and if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president\nAnd if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts\nAnd they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in the same in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take office we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office\nAnd then we got past the inauguration and they burned a few cars the left did you know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and ... you know right into the streets\nAnd that didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians were going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections\nAnd I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise\nMuller is said he'll hold it until after the election\nIf you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from the mall or investigation this will prove to the point that a lot of us believe and that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times\nIf Mueller's investigation leagues and the parts they leak say he's going to announce after the election that Donald Trump has been involved in some kind of collusion look they've been running that collusion hobby horse for two years more than two years now\nAnd they haven't way law well I I don't care if it went ten years but the the real test is and how long it when the real test is have they come up with anything\nLast year the majority of it went to wealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA ... a hold on to reverse that a doctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\n... yes I'm let's do what they're going to have a very difficult time doing that a particularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't\nWon't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves even if they don't raise\nTaxes or they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward consumers rather than business the last tax cut\nThe the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that by reducing corporate tax rate\nFrom an average of thirty five percent down\nTo Twenty one percent and he or reduce personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class\nAnd the upper classes the one that creates new capital so the first tax cut was geared to economic growth\nUm there is a feeling that uh the higher income people and they did made out better than um middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class tax cut if\nThe Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if the Republicans don't it's not likely to get that\nAnd I think they are a investor community is saying ah look all the things Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working I don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representatives with\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation but the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast well water use too fast and\nCan we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing\nWe we didn't have much inflation\nDuring all of the eight years of Obama before making a briefing on to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive amount of growth if the fed would stop crunching the economy [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that uh exact point the twelve month inflation rate for the last couple of months outs higher than Spanish and the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've pushed interest rates up\nNew home sales for the last five months of death existing home sales have death so I'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures yet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting to this similar to what you just said\nWe can get much higher quote look Ronald Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two Trump modeled his tax cut after Reagan right when Reagan tax kind of went in and eighty two in Nineteen eighty four\nThe economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half\nPercent so the fact that we're up in the four rains and tomorrow the third quarter number comes out of title will be in a high three we're nowhere near as overheated economy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over\nReacting to this they should do a little more slowly with interest rates that is true interest rates are still below historical\nNormal but they've gone up so fast that uh we're having a negative impact on interest a sensitive sectors like housing and automobiles\nSee Dr ... that's the concern I've got is that and I and I'm Wondering let me ask you straight out do you think the fed is reacting only because of the metrics or are they reacting somewhat politically as well to to crush or an economy that is making Donald Trump looked like a chance\nI certainly hope it ... or I don't I Hope they're not trying to crush the economy a President Trump appointed a Jerome Powell to be a chairman a so he's got his person in there and always been a little critical of them\nUh lately I I'm not sure what their motivation is but they don't need to do this as fast as they're they're doing now I'm ... rates were under four percent there now approaching five percent that's going to hurt the the housing market\n...

you can find a way to end the rights of National Review but Andy I'm going to get your take on on where uh what do you think is ...\nOr you can find a way to end the rights of National Review but Andy I'm going to get your take on on where\nUh what do you think is driving this bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were device and sent to a total of ten different address who's now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\n[noise] well I think was that the\nAbandon with which the media got out in front of what we know about\nThis incident which so far is not a whole lot\nUm it was really\nStaggering to me I mean the the the trends parrots determination to try to make this\nAbout Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggest that Trump a sort of it in sided this or that his rhetoric um it is so unique and uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling I'll have a piece coming out on a column coming out on National Review about this tonight but you know just when you when you move out of the world of\nPolitical uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and get into the real world of like prosecutions on the court room and a jury\nCommon people's common sense I'm most normal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attacks on the basis of anything they hear it a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorist behavior to suggest that it's driven by\nA something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say give all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN\nI guess it's not a far jumped to say well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been random targets\nAre kinda like uh the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\nYeah well I I'm not at all hesitant about that last I think that we're now at a\nRipe enough point in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here you know um but we would be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not\nAnd whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith is not that you draw a conclusion that some things politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest is the president's guilty of incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America is actually a convicted\nPeople or at least one person of incitement in court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult proof in the courtroom as it should be because\nWe have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech um but you know court ruled proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the demagogue\nOr ... or ... you know some other skills speaker at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up and they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attack\nWell and maybe they'll decide to go ... doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and it showed up\nSome ... or you know a bomb people into a a into oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I was so far it about a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say hand it's not my fault I didn't actually causing the person who riled up caused it\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything it's the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me who inspired me to do that and I look I Andy I've covered some cases they uh\nOh what was a wide area and resistance case where a Tom Mets gr inspired people to go out and and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black uh I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say you had to say\nI'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color\nAnd they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal\nBut with CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault\nTwo days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a story about the assassination of Donald Trump and then there are calling for unity and and closing the the the divisions between has its its rank ... I ...\nYeah I look I I\nCompletely agree with that they look lost it there's a doctrine of law called fighting words ... uh which is an exception to the first amendment\nUh it's it's over the years been cut back on an awful lot since the Supreme Court or recognize that in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely moribund\nA doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful to you and your presence and you\nYou know turn around and uh and and clocked me\nOf on account of it um you know it I had a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I\nInsulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say I'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot in recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attended a political rally and then you are you know you\nGo away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act and we say it's the it's the fault of the person who's rally you went to that simply it it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior will yeah just ridiculous\nAndy I you know I'm a non lawyer near the lawyer but\nI've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile to a man about say his girlfriend or his wife that it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in the in the nose and you might arguably say for something that bad you might you might get away with punching him back for his words but\nBut I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician\nBut I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters\nYou got on the president or any other politician\nBut I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton you know and some other allies like Madonna who fantasizing about blowing up the White House that if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency\nYou're going to find a lot more offenders on the left or than you are on the right the right tends to

for is that\nEven if you get the vaccine and then get genuine flew your illness is very likely to be milder less severe feel less likely to get the complication of pneumonia have to be hospitalized and die\nThe ability of the flu virus to mutate is what makes fighting it so difficult each year months in advance experts need to decide what to include in the next flu season's vaccine so that enough can be made it's a difficult process according to Dr Michael deem professor of bioengineering physics and astronomy at Rice University\nWe look to the last year's season to see what strains of us who are likely to dominate this year we also look to the southern hemisphere to see what strains are dominating in their winter which is six months out of phase from our northern hemisphere winter\nTypically the strains that will appear in the population have been around for two or three years so we can identify these strange a few years before they tend to dominate and the population\nAnd then it might take a year or so to redesign the vaccine so that's another aspect we work on as I tend to find those strains as early as possible and then helping to predict the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new strains\nThat's how the flu vaccine protects us but it also benefits and other people as well because we're a lot less likely to give the flu to somebody

born but the other vaccines that will protect them against illnesses that can kill and they can't get those first set of vaccines until two month old specifically for the flu vaccine babies have to be over six months old so\nThose babies that are under six months old are really depending on people like us to get vaccinated to vaccinate our older children because they can't get protected\nThat brings up one other meal that Schaffner wants to explode that pregnant women should avoid getting any vaccines at all\nAnd that's certainly not true for flu shots in fact a new study from the Centers

welcome to the parent garden club how can we help you\nYes my friend gave me three giant pumpkin seeds and I was wondering how to store them over the winter and how to plant them next year and what time I should try\nSo those pumpkin seeds they come out directly from a pumpkin this year or where they pre packaged\nHere it was a\nGreat while he was in the pumpkin growers association style\nSaid he could operate out of\nWhen you have and I see where it is yeah OK when he came to you where they are already in um like in a package or where they where they guarantee you\nA little plastic bag\nYeah the plastic seal bag you could actually not just wait to do anything with them at this point kind of keep it in an area where it's just going to stay the same temperature not going to go too hot not too cold\nAnd then you could start if you wanted to uh inside I'm early in the spring now\nIf you're trying to grow that big pumpkins just like everybody else they start real early\nAnd they transplant into the ground as early as possible they build green houses over the ... if you want to go that extreme we can go that extreme but at the same time data yeah so in that case if you really want it to get them started in the spring\nYou could start 'em as early as you wanted to to get them ready but realize that one of the last ... of the year is usually around may twentieth\nSo if you plan to anything outside vegetable um wise\nYou're going to need to take care of them a little bit more cover them over the um the cool weather\nOkay and really just and take care of him once you put them in early now when you get them started would have liked to do is take the seeds and put them in a a cup of water okay\nLet them sit in there for a few days you really want to get them saturated and get to the juices flowing in there and get them ready for the day or for you know for that season\nUsually about three to five days you might even see a little bit of sprouting happen okay you're just really ... are getting that that set up and ready to go\nFrom there you want to put it into a nice um plant or a little plot get started in use like a soil is mix a there's mix is out there called like a C starting mix a moment has a great one\nThere's a couple of out there that you know you could be getting but I Know that the ... seat starting for a seat starting um\nSoil is a really good one it's a white mix so you're not having that heavy soil so that the root system once it starts going in the plant starts going it can actually develop easier so that didn't want to have in the\nHouse to start it yeah you want to you know if you have a grill light in there you can put it under grow light and and act like the days have already started in the sun\nOr you can try to keep it in a sunny window that's going to get the most son uh as possible you know just to to start getting it ready to start to think that okay sit spring we need to get out in the in the ground we need to start throwing that type of thing you could they have um\nThey have some sets that are like window sill type seeds starting sets that you could use you could use a little ... parts they sell them three four inches there they usually come out right after\nUm right after Christmas into January a lot of garden centers will start bringing the all that stuff out because it is a good time to start inside\nOkay she can be getting those in there the great thing with the Pete pot is when it comes time to plant you could actually plant that right into the ground a lot of them are biodegradable and break apart or you can just break the pot to put into the ground but now that I've seen\nPeople I've seen people have um like a dome tent over there with a light bulb\nYeah and that would be a grill light a nuclear yet though is that a local garden center uh I've seen them in and multiple a garden centers\nUm around I'm trying to think urine Kenny bunk [noise] yeah um [noise]\nYou could go into trying to think they're\nI Know I Know in an area like I Know a New York there's Eldridge or hardware that would have some I could go a there's a place in\nBedford [noise] that ah that my father used to go to have to think about it um but that would be something you could use 'em but on the lives in between the break a look it up to try to get the answer for you to listen for it [noise] I don't get you an idea where you can pick up some uh some good uh [noise]\nReally [noise] I mean listen back to thanks thanks on the phone number here is eight five five six six zero four to six one [noise]\n... as a company that makes totally tone implants don't fertilizer if that's something new for you this spring new Ford in one week controls that kills weeds ground says markets an algae using on sidewalks patios ...\nYeah I Know you know I haven't had that I never had that conversation with him but I think one of the key points that you brought up in the in the conversation here is not fresh lead a fall in a ... or pine needles\nAnd that's one of the things I always get any real so that was yeah\nHe said on top of the soil there are right you don't want to mix them into the soil but if you take all in freshly following like you can go wake up your your brown following\nA pine needles apparently it's okay to put them on the surface and use them kind of as a ... that was that was what he told me so I don't I don't know you so I guess what I'd love to have you do is check that out\nAnd come back for us maybe next week and and uh give us an update on the on the controversial [laughter] fight he always ... about the ah the pine needles adding\nAss into the soil and all of that because I was I had to say I was shocked and then somebody else has said that acid loving plants actually do need line because microbes work better in that in that situation\nDo a better job of composting and breaking breaking down the or raw materials\nAnd it definitely is and and like you said it's not mixing into the soil is not doing those types of things um but so you know it is beneficial and I said you could use it I like to use them personally on the set of plants myself or if I were to write anything um\nBut yes over time when it breaks down it's going to lose that acidic effect to it it's just how you how to use it as you said do not till it into the soil put it on top there and we have the um the gentleman by the name of Darrow called a couple of minutes ago talking about\nUh the farmer in Vermont that would put them down and add extra to it to help break 'em down quicker put that black plastic over the top um so I mean I Do it really was\nThe case that was probably the key was putting that black plastic down I I agree with you on that they are adding the heat and allowing that's why the worms didn't like it because it was a little bit warmer and ... and they probably said a lot of encouraging of rage down because we know that that's what composting really does is it just as the heat and the\n... not so sue I Will I Will do some research on it uh yeah try to get back to you guys next week and more information about it\nUm but like I said you know it's one of my one of my things I used to say I'm at the garden center when somebody would come in and say all pop parents said you could use this I'd uh I'd look straight in the face and say you know what I've been trying for thirty six years not to listen to that man\nAnd people are just kind of look at me and I'd sit there and say well yeah it's my father who listens to their parents you know that's just what happens [noise] um\nBut I'll have to I'll have to listen to some of the old shows or listen to that type of thing and really do some research or to get more information about you [noise] ah that's one of the great things about this show um\n[noise] is other people calling in talking about what my father had talked about and given that information you know we learned everybody learn something I'm learns differently everybody learn something new each day and that's really you know you're you're really yeah\nGet me thinking All right I got to look more into that 'cause I've always just thought the same way you know he too acidic soil oak leaf know seal later\nGet those out here um but you know if there there's research being done on all these things every day or so it'd be hard to really look at so you know I appreciate you bringing that up I appreciate everybody who's been calling in with the pine needles suck 'cause\nThis is the time here when we have tons of 'em out there you know\nRight and if we can if we can utilize their more successfully why not\nRight so yeah definitely and like I Know you'll\nYou'll check it out and let us know\nWhen one of the things like I was with a lead to briefly was in the south I've heard pine needles being used as monsters everywhere um so you know as you said he read off that the pine needles can have a very acidic\nA P H A three point two to three point eight mean three point lead you to three point eight when the normal neutral is six point eight normal in New England for\nFor lawns to have\nA that I've seen when people do soil tests and really don't do a lot it's close to like a five point eight and that's considered acidic or a five point two five ...\nNow if you think about three point two three point eight from the acidic level of the the pine needles you got to be sitting there saying are you kidding me\nBut that doesn't make any sense a so it doesn't you know so let me let me do some research this week and I will bring it up next week to try to to get some more answers 'cause this is this good information to know\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm I I'm looking forward to it I'll be sure to tune in next\nWeek

I'm sure they make commercial route cleaners but I'm the way I typically I tell people is to use 'em an oxygen bleach powdered oxygen blaze bleach some water\nAnd um and then poured onto the floor let it sit for twenty minutes or so than scrub it and that works really well and you get okay auction bleach goes by names like auction cleaner age actually makes one um but there's another thing of actually use that works great and you might not think of it is toilet bowl cleaner\nIf you have a really bad stain grout Lysol makes and comes in a plastic bottle I think it's about\nA pipe and a half or so and has a tangled novel on it I guess it's it's angles that can squirt it up under the room in the toilet thing but it makes it really easy to apply just to ... joints\nSo he just he's outta beat of this stuff it's it's like a sick liquid ... joins let it sit there for thirty minutes or so and then describe it with a like a rough clause like a piece of a Terry cloth towel or something like that\nAnd just by the way with all these techniques just chime in one spot make sure they don't do the whole floor and find out ... might not work\nAnd ... and I bet that would work you know okay and yet you have to make sure it's relatively dry the floor of the relatively dry I'm you know which apparently it is and try that and then let us know if either of those work ... I'd be surprised if they didn't\nOkay what about um the companies that use the advertisers like grocery store type stuff or are you have any information on those guys\nWell not any particular companies but yeah that would be a last resort if you had to okay that that's why I said how why does joined time if you had to remove even part of the ground like just an eighth inch of ... in a kitchen that's a lot of ground to remove and refill so I I Would try just cleaning as best you can I mean you should be relatively clean\nAnd Jeff also um the the the use of steam a lot of times with the little ... and some of these different ones there we had a lot of luck with that as well just using just water so different way to go but hopefully uh hopefully that'll work well for you and even more so we certainly wish you the best of luck in selling the house and moving on to greener pastures\nThank you guys appreciate your time ... has a lot of calls from national ... yeah I Know do I basically I was the last few weeks hey right now it's time\nFor our best new product of the week you know the look of rustic or barn would\nHas become incredibly popular for accent walls and decorative features but not everyone has access to an old barn or fans to salvage materials from not to mention that would may be treated with chemicals or even worse infested with insects that's what makes\nWhite wash weathered hardwood board such a great fun they created in the impression of reclaim barn would indoors without the hassle of finding Salva gene cleaning all that plus the dimensions are consistent which will make installation a whole lot easier and only three ... inch thick\nThey also create fewer problems with surrounding trim\nThe boards are mailed from domestic popular with variations in color texture and expose solve marks they give it a very rustic appearance without any treatment chemicals or insects plus\nThey're killed dried for stability and the paint used on them is low V.

O. N. P. A. M. fourteen fifty in one at one point seven FM we get so many great calls and emails from our friends in the Washington state area and uh keep them come in and a special hello to you or during this week\nAnd a special shout out to station owner brown and Maloney and minority owner Todd or off thanks so much guys were putting us on the air port ... Dan is located and the beautiful north shore of the Olympic Peninsula about eighty miles or so North West of Seattle\nAnd it's also I'm a very short ferry ride across to another breathtakingly beautiful spot which is Vancouver Island British crawl yeah I don't know if you've ever been up in that part of the world but why is that spectacular yeah and you can see why people want to live up there is just beautiful out\nThere quite a bit that that ride out to Vancouver Island can be a pretty lengthy little ride is not just above their does stay a little ... and limit the show to get better [laughter] but but once you get there you don't want to leave us it is an absolutely beautiful part of the world\nSo hey let's see if we can do a few of these emails here Joe our um this is from Paul in Georgia are range in the kitchen doesn't that to the outside St circulates through a filter is that a problem if I don't have a a and let's see is that a problem if I don't have a gas so well\nYeah you know have the problem with the re circulating winter when did they just going to outlaw that and uh just just go in and and I don't know but anyway the fact the fact that you don't have a guest a well that's good news but not great news because the financial just normal cooking\nIt includes some pretty bad compounds that can be pretty dangerous to your health even\nIf they're created on an electric stove wells that elation becomes even more important if this job is gas because of the themes given off as the fuel burns the best defense is a range could advance all the way to the outside not just an addict\nBut if you have to use it to you have to really use it to be effective to make sure the fan his own any time to cook tapas and use it for at least you know ten minutes or so afterwards and it's a good idea to run the fan when you're cleaning to make sure those themes given off by any cleaning products also a scape your indoor air we're talking about the indoor air\nQuality all the time and uh this is a great example there and and certainly are friends that brand new tone can provide you a lot more information on cleaning up your air inside your house you can go to ... dot com or\nNew tone dot com to be able to pick up a little information I it just seems to be a bigger problem or the awareness of it is getting more and more um widespread with the consumers understand in that ... inside there can be pretty bad\nRight and that's why October is National Air quality month because you know we're moving indoors we're butting up the house were spending more time indoors and outside\nAndme or um you know adding more and more insulation putting in better windows talking all the facts and that's all great is saving energy but meanwhile what about their that's inside\nAll that moisture all the orders from cooking and ex sailing everything else that's you know the air's got to go somewhere so yeah nothing better than a\nReally good vents in in the bathroom in the kitchen and here's the key you have to use them faster I mean if you're not flipping Amano not doing any good so uh yeah use them and make sure they get to the outside and as David mentioned never met them in the addict he's leaving the house leaving the living space but not leaving the house right\n... hey here's another one from Maggie and listen to this this this town sandwich Massachusetts\nOh I Know sandwich that's out on the Cape relax through sandwich every time we go out to northeast I Am out on the Cape yeah Cape Cod eleven sandwich sits right next to the mashed pay it really yeah we have a little ... sandwiches uh\nMashed peace and weight wow ... already then well let's see [laughter] oh and this has nothing to do with sandwiches or turkey or um Swiss cheese or anything it's a hot day anyway recent removed all of our window screens but before storing them away for the winter I Would like to wash them first any tips on how to get them good and clean\nAnd ready for next spring thanks a thanks my husband and I love your show well thank you ... we appreciate that if we can certainly provide you some great information here first of all if the screens are fairly small you can uh just use a a buy one of the inexpensive\nUm children swimming pool is one of the little tiny kitty pool yeah the little kid he pulls little molded thing there um and then put soaked solution in there and so from a little bit\nThen struggled with a kind of assault bristle brush and then a blast off with the you know the spray of your water hose that makes it real easy especially when you're able to stack several of them ... be able to get seven or eight of them in there at one time depending on if they're wood frame or limited frame\nThat's a great way to soak it out but Joe I recall that uh you you came up with a great idea and and it's an idea that I have used a number of times um there's a pretty simple solution to this involving a what just for short two by fours\n[noise] uh yeah ... oh you're talking about bill\nThere's a number of times um there's a pretty simple solution to this involving a or just for short two by fours\nA yeah ... oh you're talking about building yeah right just taking the two by fours and then you putting plastic rain little plastic around it that way you can build the frame to specially like if you can't get a ... big enough for your she goes ... if you have some\nThat are more um vertical more a rectangular or we Longate it and then to be able to build that and then I mean you can use it to before you use it to ... whatever you want to make as deep as you want the plastic idol was Wall Street nickels and dimes chair and not caution you very much\nBut man oh man does that ever I mean you can ... you know blow them off with a water hose it's not going to make them as clean as as getting down into crevices of the screen and especially if you're a proactive homeowner like Maggie is here than uh than you really can make a big difference by doing that\nYeah they take forever the dry but the best that the trick is to tap them you know be careful with them but after you clean them and you can ... the best way to describe them clean when they're sitting in the water so people are is just with a broom like a long handled boom you don't have to bend over in his suite the back and forth flip it over sweet back and forth\nBut then top it when you pull it out tap it to get rid of the excess while because one of his claim to the screen and they take forever to dry but the other simple solution I think I I shared awhile ago Dan is if they're not really dirty\nYou can only have to put them in water does use a household vacuum with a ... yeah that's right yeah usually upholstery brush you describe them scrub the frames and the screens you know obviously if you're both sides and I get off most of the dust\nAnd then if you do that like every two or three years you might only have to soak 'em and water once every four or five years so I'll say a trouble Newman storm I have mine up in the attic and I always put them in\nUm big um trash bags or yeah or cardboard boxes because you know they're just adoptive just leave him say around but somebody does your options either use water don't use what I Would start with just a vacuum and associate dean\nCome if they come up clean then you know then you get a storm way dry as they are\nYeah that's a great proactive way of taking care of and a lot of areas of the country are doing just like Maggie is doing that they know they you know it's getting colder in some areas of the country you know you're not going to be able to open those windows are very much anymore to allow that fresh air to blow through so\nGo ahead and use it as an opportunity to remove the screens to keep them from being damage\nOr an certainly getting dirty or in that way it's nice and clean and ready to put them back on when spring rolls around want to remind you of the today's hold her hotline one eight hundred non for six\nForty four twenty and certainly want to encourage you to check us out on Facebook Twitter Instagram and\n... and certainly you can download our podcast anytime on a tune to that a lot more information coming up here in a few giveaways we're going to share with you on that actually is the last week\nTo win one of those Joe I'll tell you what the emails key rolling in here already grab us another\nOne here see if we can help help out on Tom is in Medina, Ohio I have been done a number of times\nA Tom says we're installing a subway towel back splashing our kitchen I read that the first row of the tiles must be level however my existing countertop is ten foot long and the slope five sixteenth ... from the left to right and\nI hate when that happens huh do or maintain the slope or do I have to draw level on at the bottom and start from there I'm there for the ... route I'm gap at the bottom where the towel meets the granite will be one sixteenth on one side five sixteenth on the right what do you suggest well I'm\nJoe you know you you've you've written the towel book so you you know you're the you know than the expert on all of this but I'm just a few things to consider first of all you can't lay the towel crooked it has to be level\nAnd so you when you have these situations you're looking for the the the the way that you can do it with least with it being um the least obvious that it is an level and of course if you could fix the countertop that's great what best approach to this you think\nWell I'm seeing is email he says that ... ten foot long and its slopes five sixty seven inch and you're right you don't want\nSome setting your tiles especially subway tiles with all all those vertical all those horizontal lines being way out of level but in my experience you're never gonna see five sixty seven inch over ten feet you're just not going to say I would say set the tile right on the countertop\nAnd just follow it and make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that's going to be noticed will not ...\nAnd just follow it and make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that can be noticeable in that first course and all the ... tiles that will be out of\nOut of level so to speak will be hidden up underneath the cabinet and he mentioned that is a backup one saying where a\nTom mentioned setting the drought\nOn setting the ... on the bottom you don't want to set put drought under that ties with the town tile meets a counter top right silicon yeah 'cause those two materials are gonna move separately so\nYou know where we have tile meeting something else you know another material um you what you might silicone there and go but I Would set it right on top of that first course right out you'll never noticed that being at a level over ten feet\nYeah that's probably the best way to go ... got to have a level you will always\nNotice actual you'll feel like the floors cricket or something you don't want that but maybe it is very ...

home warmer in the winter uh in addition to ceiling up draftee windows you can switch the direction of your ceiling fans change your filters and of course get a system to know from your local carrier dealer\nSure certainly and and you know of people are starting to realize are getting smarter smarter the consumers that you know if you just change your lifestyle a little bit and and and turned the heat or down just a little bit just go to Seventy degrees every now and then when you're in the middle of winter you you won't notice that if you put on another sweater and you could save a lot of money by doing that\nYeah actually uh according to the U.S department of energy you can lower the heat in your home ten to Fifteen degrees for eight hours a day and in fact by doing that you can save as much as ten percent on your annual heat income and that's perfect when you're at work and the kids are at school\nI Know you get used to that too and and of course the programmable thermostats and so forth are so easy to to implement and so forth and uh but you know also one of the things that you guys are always impressed me man I went through all of the research facilities that testing facilities is it's amazing there in Indianapolis but\nYou know I'm ... for heat technology and the two stage furnished is this is something uh people are starting to understand a little bit more that\nYou know that more is not always better and certainly when you have this you know powerful fan it's not necessarily the way to get very nice comfortable temple\nMoore is not always better and

give me a call dumpy embarrassed let me know the phone number eight seven seven Seventy five eighty two fifty five let me get back to the phones and one of my favorite cities in the whole wide world beautiful Ocean City Maryland Kevin welcome to the pressure\nAnymore now you're doing I can not be doing better Kevin how's everything and beautiful Ocean City today it's wonderful I Love your show by taking my call it's my pleasure what can I Do for you\nWe adopted a dog about a year ago from the humane society\nIt's wonderful I Love your show by taking my call it's my pleasure what can I Do for you\nWell we adopted a dog about a year ago from the humane society\nHe has been in three different uh SPCA humane societies the year before we got him these two years old when we got him a severe car aggression and very severe dog aggression\nAnd he obviously was not a socialized to many things which we've been working for a year ah we also had professional trader come to the house for about eight sessions to work on the dog aggression\nAnd it's gotten better but it's not short and he uh\nYou talk about the two jokes dog when you take it for a walk the beacon journal the drop of a dime it'd be very aggressive\nI'm I'm running to ask you yeah let me ask you a question Kevin when you take 'em for a walk and he turns into a coup Joe what is your training suggest that you do at that point\nWe train him with the command called law which calls for him to sit and look up at us as she said the get is a church in with that command either until that dog passes or for us to redirect them and go a different direction\nOkay so then what you're doing by following that advice and nothing against the trainer but what you're doing by following that advice is you're paying attention to the fact\nThat your dog is acting like ooh Joe\nAnd by paying attention to the fact you're reinforcing that behavior the training aspect is fine but when the dog is reacting in an aggressive manner what often happens is the guardian or you when the dog is reacting that way you're going to react by making the dogs ... making the dogs stay\nThe dog is already uncomfortable because he sees another dog if he's already uncomfortable by using those basic commands what you're doing is making them even more uncomfortable\nHere's what I recommend that you do and it's going to sound a little crazy but I've been trained over forty thousand dollars I think you agree with me when you're taking your dog for a walk\nAnd he reactor sees another dog I don't want you to do a thing I Want you to continue walking straight ahead if you want to stay it's none of your concern that's fine but don't stop once you stop you or reinforcing\nThat behavior so just keep walking don't stop after you go past the other dog maybe oh thirty or forty feet you can find them on the head don't we after we just keep walking\nThat's the way to resolve it sometimes the best resolution to a problem it's really simple resolution like that\nSo what often happened just want to have a dog gets aggressive towards another dog they pulled the dog back they say no bad dog sit stay down all of this has to be taken into consideration from what you just told me the dog had three different SPCA before you got him\nFirst of all every time he goes in the car he assumes he's going to be a band and again that's why he's reacting that way when he sees another dog because he spent so much time around the dog at different shelters he assumes the other dogs may be assertive or how for aggressive towards him so what you need to do is let him know no reaction is necessary because\nBecause that dog is across the street as long as you keep walking straight ahead don't react to it little by little not overnight but he will come around by prompt does that make sense to you there Kevin\nIt makes a ton of sense that I'm going to pour that it served a thank you for that and I asked him advice\nAnd it doesn't happen overnight please give the dog a little bit of a break he had three different homes already and sometimes they had these abandonment issues they become really really attached to the people there was\nAlso the more social life and you do the better off you know what I'm gonna do Kevin let me do something for Kevin on hold and Kevin I'm actually going to send you a copy of my book how to get your doctor do you want\nAnd the reason I Want you to read the book is because not only will teach you the basics but more importantly than the basics it will teach you how to build up the dog's confidence the dog self esteem and that is going to make all of the difference there were all\nEight seven seven Seventy five eighty two fifty five the phone number eight seven seven Seventy five eight to five five that is
