a lot of things that you would tend to you don't think of as a business like if I went to a jazz festival I might not think about this is the business and that's where we have\nToday is we have ... who's the director of the downtown north Hampton association the DNA high high\nAnd Ruth Griggs who is the president of the north Hampton jazz festival much to both of you here earning now the audience has heard your different voices and we'll know who's talking but occasionally remind them just as they argue this is Ruth\nSo this is very exciting as a lover of jazz and I hope to be around that weekend my cobra Nineteen Twenty one but just both of you just take a shot at talking about the north Hampton jazz festival but its history what's going on at cetera\nSure I'll I'll start a little bit that north Hampton jazz festival had been around downtown for ... several years and then he'll roughly a take three or four years ago\nUm when it trickled off and our organization started in two thousand sixteen shortly after the ... of the DNA shortly after the jazz festival anticipated\nAnd I found myself getting questions all the time she would be great to have more music downtown gee that jazz festival is wonderful with only that could be more jazz music downtown and so I took the hands and reached out to the north Hampton jazz festival and ask than Bagdad\nPerhaps we could think about bringing jazz back to downtown or Hampton and I connected with Ruth\nAnd Ruth you had headed it emits earlier for\nNo I was I was a acted as a marketing consultant and media consult uh-huh I'm In uh in two thousand fourteen and Fifteen\nThousand his name was the last year that it was held uh-huh in a big tent behind thorn for it was a originally designed back in two thousand eleven to kind of replace that tasted north Hampton uh-huh so it was a combination of jazz and food trucks and vendors and\nThe retro fair and the ... and the top of my own meal it became a little bit of like a little bit of everything uh-huh and\nWhen I met with Amy and she said like do you think you could bring this back maybe I can help you but I I don't\nBob booking the accent I Want to use so have that covered ... and we can take care of that um\nAnd we decided um mutually very easily that we wanted to change the model mhm um because the model behind thorns had become very expensive and cumbersome to stage and manage and\nSo Amy ... who's the producer of the jazz festival\nBoth came up with the idea of having it all around town uh-huh and I was really excited the first night models first night model right yep and uh the one of the reasons why we wanted to do that is\nOf course to bring more lived jazz literally all around town and have more of a benefit to the merchant you're in the past\nAnd secondly it to less expensive model right so we're hoping that it will be more ...\nIs when you're diagnosed what happened when you said that the old version had trickled was partially those costs are where the absolutely uh-huh and then I guess you know a few of the taste north Hampton\nUh everybody eats not everybody loves jazz and I think a lot of people that say the love of jazz love elevator jazz so [laughter] just discuss who's who is your audience\nLovers of jazz um young people who are learning and playing jazz as well as\nYou know octogenarian plus love to hear the standards um I had a wonderful call from a woman from Long Island two days ago who said that she'd heard about it and she and her husband coming to Northampton for the first time to hear the\nJazz festival in North Hampton that's great um so I was I was thrilled to hear that um when I saw many I'm Sorry\nSorry I was gonna say lovers of live music in general we have friends who are coming into town to come to the festival and they don't really love jazz necessarily but they love going out to hear some really good live music and you know being created by people who know good musicians and are bringing those good musicians into downtown rise exciting\nI think a lot of people have more preconceptions about jazz than they might have about rock for instance and and ah\nYou know if you come and you're in the right state of mind you can sit ... love it even if you're not a veteran lover absolutely and I've been to a lot of rock concerts around here between the Green River and the one in ... and things like that and it just seems like\nYou get a lot of children and grandparents in like the people that show up it's like what is that person doing on a rock festival but it's just a happening\nHelping to support this kind of unique event is truly north handwritten and and keeping\nThese kinds of things are going so that north Hampton conceal hybrids and ended a real definition\nAnd there's other benefits to this that affect north Hampton metro north him for to talk a little bit about the student education program\nShore so we as part of this um jazz festival worked really hard to come up with the way to make it\nA way to give back beyond just bringing that traffic to downtown and we reached out and learned that there was a jazz program happening at JFK middle school was clarion Williams they have on to jazz bands and a huge group of middle school age children who are just getting excited about and learning about jazz\nAnd the board of the north Hampton jazz festival decided that it would be a wonderful way to support 'em up and coming jazz musicians and just encourage the growth of jazz throughout the community to partner with JFK middle school and create this um scholarship program to when I talk a little bit about the program\nYeah so the idea is that on Sunday or we are ... that jazz festival with the hotel north Hampton jazz brunch ... and that's going to be an incredibly delicious award winning brunch\nWith a live jazz quintet ... and it's a fundraiser for this new jobs in the public schools program mhm um and we'll have members of the JFK a middle school band playing as people come in and the whole notion is that\nUm in in collaboration with the north Hampton jazz workshop which ... or ... in our producer has been running for eight and a half years here in North Hampton\nHe will be bringing in a professional jazz musician\nThree times a year to go into the schools on Monday to work with the jazz students directly one on one and clinics and workshop\nAnd then the musician will spend Monday Night go back in on Tuesday Morning too and assembly for that\nOr is he he or she will play at the workshop on Tuesday night which is always on Tuesday mhm and invite the ... the kids from the jazz band to come and enjoy the workshop and join in on the the open jam which always happens on Tuesday night and so it's a wonderful example of collaboration between\nThe workshop the festival and the public schools which which were just over the moon excited about and Allen Davis um who's the founder of the the Davis financial group\nA list or piano player I forget which are can be really raise these\n... incredible lover of jazz and and he is a huge supporter of judge jag legislation yeah\nSo when he heard about the jazz and the school's program he said well I'd like to ... so um we've decided that should we have extra funds that we do collect on Sunday that it it's going to go towards a scholarship\nFor um a deserving um high school student to go to the jazz in July program which is the UMass jazz in July program so either way we cut the cake we are you're supporting young musicians learning that\nSo I don't remember the details of this was pre coffee at five in the morning but it just sort of north Hampton one yet another best town in the world something or rather what is the\n... because I mean I I Know it's one of these awards through the years and you just talk about how you feel like north Hampton is a town that kind of has the bones to put on the festival like the\nShore I think that I'm One of the things that makes Northampton the wonderful place that has to live and to be a business owner is there's a strong sense of community and collaboration and our downtown\nNot only do we have this wonderful mix of unique stores and restaurants they're owned by our friends and our neighbors and our parents on our siblings\nAnd they're all looking for ways that we can collaborate and work together to to help better downtown north Hampton and not old saying all the rise of the tide I think it exemplifies\nOne of the things that is just the most unique and special about north Hampton and when you bring in a festival like the north Hampton jazz festival that comes in and says we want to bring music you know downtown to Northampton\nWe had a tremendous number of businesses step up and ask how they could help how they could sponsor how they could hang a banner how they could host musician how they could help us publicized and I think that\nThis type of collaborative effort as Ruth was saying is is what makes Northampton unique and what helps festivals like this um thrive in a damper on like our ... and\nThere's so many attractive buildings and the sidewalks are so wide and capable of socializing and the streets are big and it's just great I mean I I've been in this town for other great stuff including you know the the whole town streets or women's march many thousands people\nRead and I think we have some new spaces that are being made it in different ways that will ask you park of course is the one that everybody champions but there is improvements unpleasant street fairs\nYou haven't been down market street lately\nAnd market a straight as hopping I'm and we're starting our hands and the railroads right click York's basis on market street I'm even historic Northampton under the bridge also as doing great thanks so there's a lot of wonderful energy and non traditional for North him downtown spots which I don't get is helping\nAnd so you have a lot of different venues ... how many simultaneous Sox world there will be\nWe actually are not doing simultaneous acts on Saturday on as we want to give the proper respect and focus to the musicians that are coming here to plow\nThere'll be um they'll start at eleven o'clock in the morning it click more space and morose brag and and um and they said he was great and then the expandable brass bands will lead everybody downtown from there\nTo the Unitarian society and the part of the room with ... and we'll go back and forth between those venues are very well coordinated right and and the um\nAnd we're drones will park and it's like you know three thousand more people with cars and all of a\nGood question um I've been obsessed with that for about the past six months so we not only have one map to tell people where the parking is but we have to uh-huh we have a printed map that I'm just sending to the printer now I'm which will be available to hand out to people\nThat shows that exactly where they can park and exactly where all the venues are going to be a and then we also have an interactive Google Map on our website uh-huh um that that that's the same so\nHow widespread is the marketing I mean I Know that was the hospitality presidents and prime your belly but polls from New York and further\nWell I mentioned the woman who called me from Long Island yeah hum and with Google advertising well we're pulling from all across the northeast uh-huh literally all all New England and all across the northeast ...\nWe have some significant partners that are helping us out of the mass fine arts center has really stepped up to support this festival and their reach amongst their audience is tremendous and so I think that's giving us a big boost\nIn spring so just to another question about jazz you know sometimes you see somebody like a Jackson Pollock grew up across so and you go like my five year old to do that and then you see that they can also paint something that looks like a photograph\nOr do you find a lot of jazz musicians can play in a very traditional league discipline way among at all that jazz is just chaos but\nAny any jazz starts with the with the ... with the tune mhm um it it certainly that that type of jobs that you're going to hear the jazz festival starts with that tune whether it's an original tune or it's a standard\nIt starts to that melody and then they take off from there so I think it I think it as approachable but it's it's\nPeople don't understand that notion of there's a there's the original form the original song ... and then they improvise on that song threats that's basically the the as a central structure of jazz\nYeah and then people that come from one period of jazz or another is due to those are tend to be respectful whole evolution of the art form or it's like that's my ...\nWell I think that everybody has opinions um when it comes to the music that they love and what we're trying to do at this jazz festival is represented wider range of\nMusic and I'm jazz genres as we can um from from vocalists too\nYou know renowned folks like ... to um guitarists and everyone in between um we wanna we wanna have people enjoy it and as many ways as they possibly can\nWho can you just give me a brief answer into the business side of this whole thing what is the organization known as the north Hampton jazz festival\nIt is a five oh one C. three ... the previous president um spend a lot of time and effort to achieve that status and that's huge and very appreciative of his efforts\nSo even when the festival stop for three years you must have had hoped that it was going to spark up again if you kept before everyone she's very\nLet's just put it this way we kept the five oh one C. three and I'm really glad about that [laughter]\nBut yes you can only imagine that after it had been um quiet for\nThree years we did have some serious kind of\nBringing back of everything from a legal perspective and a taxation perspective in organizational perspective and that was that was a lot of work ... and\nI'm very glad that Amy and I got together I think originally and like the spring of two thousand Seventeen right just start to begin to talk about this and I'm Glad we started yeah because\nUS Congressman Jim McGovern from the second congressional district in Massachusetts joined

New York times best selling author and illustrator with his new series of unlimited growth being celebrated at the museum on Saturday October thirteenth run on sentences but that was really good it was a lot of common yeah\nIt was just fast none of the squirrels are\nBoys or girls you know they're not gender it's not my job to decide the urgent love it that's a different thing when it with elephant picky I was very specific this ten Fifteen Years ago about gender in elephant piggy and realizing that a boy and a girl and hang out and they can play and that\nThe girl character doesn't need all these ... you know right no bows no bows or long eyelashes or dresses right biggie can be picky and one of the things that turn out to be really cool is when kids dress up as her favorite characters often the boys dress up as piggy and girls dress up as elephant it just doesn't matter right\nAnd in the same way what I wanted to make sure with these squirrels that if you ask a question are they boys or girls the answer is yes\nI Love that it's almost like their facts in this book there are a bunch of people getting along together working together they defy normative stereotypes it's

that will be this Friday at ... said again\nSeven AM to seven PM at the same table Jennifer ... and\nIt is for marketing since we're sharing a microphone in this all looks totally inappropriate why don't you just take the microphone into\nIt we're like we're like\nJohn Paul from the Beatles sharing the same micro [noise]\nIt's sad to benefit refugee resettlement and the Northampton area through Catholic charities a great article in today's feeling after ... written\nBy one Bob clarity who will be playing ping pong for twelve hours and tomorrow on the show bearing a segment that he taped right here at river valley co op river valley coauthors if you change it from market to co op after remind myself and I thought you were shell plenty and the the co-op here\nHave hired five refugees in this area because as you were saying off the earlier Newman you have a Ninety day window once you are resettled here to get a job\nAnd so why is this has been something that's been so important for river valley co opt to support the hiring of refugees resettling in this area\nWell our community as you know is very supportive of of refugees and um and we are always looking for employees and so it's a perfect match and I'm\nWorking with Catholic charities we were able to um I get some a really great people and as you might imagine English can sometimes be a a difficult thing and then you add\nA English language in uh in retail natural foods co ops and you've got some other words that aren't like that ...\nLearn how to speak hippie\n[noise] what about choice where are the ham seed harder [laughter]\nYeah so so some extra extra sure that will be on the citizenship exam yeah right [laughter]\nYeah um and so uh you know and we've uh we've we've got\nFive people now so far um two of them are came to us a fluent in five languages none of them English but one of them was French and are prepared foods manager\nIs also from France and uh was able by placing them in that department he was able to help them transition from French to English and into the co op and they're both are uh are doing really well fulltime jobs here and um you know it's just been great and he remembers\nPeople from already did just meet with people you mess five weeks ago and already be table with him at an open house for a new green building project right builders and there's a lot of lot of leverage\nWell let me turn if I Am I from ... who's the worker or they were grown or TV square to Joe use and Randy ... from collective copies Rand is working on her job as a worker owner to court to copies news from the world of collective copies and ... press\nYes thank you bill I'm Randy from collective copies\nOr we're a worker own print shop and a publishing house now or been in business since Nineteen eighty three um all your typical print on demand projects business cards brochures pamphlets booklets\nYou name it we do it ah posters banners if you can think of it that's what we do as well as our newest venture into publishing self publishing print on demand books um lots of exciting stuff going on there the big thing this year I think which is uh [noise]\nUh the biggest change for us as as a business that is now thirty five years old or a lot of our founding members and older members are retiring\nAnd thank you for the delicate phrasing of that I really appreciate that\nAre are are retiring and those of us who were once a young collective or not anymore and uh and that's been a real interesting things\nHandle the turnover\nAnd heavy hand off owners ownership I mean you are who have been there for a long time are the owners are have been the owners of collective copies of worker owned co-op right now new people come in and presumably they're going to be owners as well as the\nMotion of the uh ownership interests how does that all worked out\nThe interesting question I'm so one of the things that was built into the bylaws of collective copies as a worker owned businesses that are by and it was only two hundred and fifty dollars that is what you pay to get a share of collective copies and when you leave collective copies that is what you get back\nAnd so it was a way to build in not selling out if it got to profitable and or the owners that were there when it was super profitable to cash out and cash in\nSo uh the goal of collective copies ... to be a business that is there for the long term that's rooted in the community which I think it's a pretty big value cooperatives\nAnd um [noise] so it's a way to ensure that the business days there to be an employee you're in the workplace for generations to come\nWe're going to take a quick break in our show here live from the river valley caught up in North Hampton this is our annual co-op show when we come back we're going to be speaking with worn face the the owner of our family farms Robin O'Brien's journey food co-op as well as all of our other guests from cars up and down the valley we'll be right back stay with us this is\nBill Newman WHM pay the bill Newman's salad ... with the supported the odyssey bookshop south happily independent book selling since Nineteen sixty\nNorth happen cameras Greenville polio idea behind valley gives us a gift and I'm probably never to have to stretch and learn and engage we look to health girls overcome economic gender an academic barriers we do that with what we call us girls think experience we don't have\nThe kind of community that we have without the social justice organization is working so hard and that is a community with just one person writing a check everyone's doing it together\nA gym [noise]\nJust lay their previous problem solver yes [noise] looking upgrade your hands to me as a local and be part of your community yes\nThe Northampton radio group is looking to hire the right sales person does it you know great turning in lifestyle potential sleep in your own better than I have a great career sales will train the right person for the first step is to get yourself an interview send a resume cover letter to jobs at W. H. P. dot com [noise] north Hampton radio group is an equal opportunity\nEmployer\nNot too long ago I made a big mistake I let our teenage daughter had a drinking party at the house I thought it was the right thing to do I thought it would be safer if they drank here\nAnd I'm embarrassed to say I thought we might be the cool parents I didn't know was illegal still allow teenagers to drink alcohol in our home that we could be prosecuted fine even jailed\nAnd we were and that wasn't cool brought to you by the drug free action alliance\nTake a guess how many people in Florida can't vote because of a felony conviction I'm Bill Newman and this is the civil liberties minute\nIn Florida a person with a felony cannot vote after his or her conviction unless that right is reinstated specifically by the governor this is also the case in Iowa Kentucky and Virginia\nNationwide some six million people are disenfranchised because of these voting restrictions in Florida alone one point four million people ten percent of the state's adult population can't vote because of a felony conviction no matter how long ago or how minor\nThis November there was a proposed amendment to the state constitution on the ballot question for\nThat would allow a person convicted of a felony to vote after successfully completing all the terms of a criminal sense including parole or probation passage is not guaranteed they will take sixty percent of the vote in Florida for this provision to pass\nAnd this is a modest proposal it ex lose classes a former prisoners from its coverage which it shouldn't\nWhy would we ever want to keep someone who is fully paid the price for his or her crime and wants to re engage in civic participation by voting\nFrom doing so we give me one legitimate reason\nTo silence is deafening\nThe civil liberties minute is made possible by the ACLU because freedom can't protect itself\n[noise] this is the best stuff ill Newman\nWHM ... news in New York [noise]\n[noise] this is Phil Newman WHM we continue our annual carp show as we broadcast live from the river valley co-op here in North Hampton we were speaking before the break with just over who is worker\nOwner at collective copies also with us from collective copies worker owner to be Joe use Randy was telling us about the buy in and buy out for people coming in\nA Randy I'm not quite how to put this to you but Jill looks like she might be one of those new or owners being slightly younger than you see is okay so Jill how does it work for someone answering collective copies as a new member of the collective\nRight well a collective copies interviewed a number of candidates for their apprentice positions The Apprentice is that the job title that I have I'm an apprentice printer\nAnd I'm a parent is to each his my a fellow worker owners are there are currently co ah sorry eight co owners and I work with each of them they each have different working styles different strengths that they bring to the cooperative\nWhoa that's such a cooperative just the way to put they all have their different strengths all of\nThose supervisors or sure the princes or print is what what is it what do they call it the people you were practicing\nFor are they are worker owners just were grown okay mhm or printers also printers and members\nOkay so you're a practicing there to war and the job how long does that position continue for\nThe apprenticeship last for up to six months or it can be a shorter generation but generally around six months at which time the\nIf The Apprentice would like to be considered for a ownership than the entire cooperative holds a meeting discusses whether they would like to vote in that apprentice to become a co owner and the vote has to be unanimous I Believe\nFrom the bylaws wow how many people do lifted go ... there are a lot of people they're talking about you or oh my goodness\nYes [laughter] I don't get to witness all of that I don't think that yes\nAnd this process let me go back to Randy a zoo go for a second this process actually works cooperatively this sounds to me like it's a kind of an administrative ... a difficult ... mystery to be difficult thing to do but you saying yes it works\nIt has to work because if it doesn't if we're hiring somebody who's going to be an owner of the business with us and so what we're basically doing is every one of us is voting to hire this person is our business partner and so\nThere's not driving with this person than it really can't work\nHow many worker worker owners are there a collective copies\nThere were eight right now worker owners or to apprentices who are on track and it's a very pretty brutal process\nTo have to ah to to go through and you have to have some thick skin and be able to take some criticism and and be\nAble to adapt to a work environment that really requires communication between people and being able to work together well to make it work and it does collective copies is now how old thirty five years old\n[noise] let me turn now if I might to warn face the Warren is an owner of our family farms great to see you again our annual pilgrimage

helping\nYou\nDot ORG one by one showing forging a hundred and forty\nDollars major Jewish information and the arch [noise]\nThis is the best of bill Newman [noise]\nWHM peak news in\nThis is bill Newman WHM [noise] we continue our annual co op show broadcasting live from the river valley co op you're in North Hampton during the break we can send you\nTo our conversation and this was a conversation about\nDollars money and numbers of Lyndon Andrew from car power you're the president explain a little bit more about that to our listeners but he's not sure we made that totally cleared the first go around how does it work the numbers out of the money work has the money work in a cooperative and that was the money work\nFor your co op in terms of the goals you know\nWell I think I think for many of us what we were just talking about is that we're able to offer\nGood quality financial value to our customers who are members\nUm by collaborating with each other doing group buying so we were able to access better pricing um is Robin was talking about by buying together the food co ops are able to\nUm function as one larger store because they they combine their purchasing power collect power was able to raise that ten million dollars for um financing nonprofit solar and community solar projects by\nPartnering together with other energy cooperative around the country so there's um by by working together we're able to access some of the scale that you need in order to get better pricing for your customers\nSo say a person wants to become a member of car power and or wants to put solar on the house but doesn't have the financial resources to do that what does that person do\nUm well we we offer a one stop shop for people to come in and I'm looking at their homes look at their energy use and decide and figure out how to get off of fossil fuels in and save money in the process so\nUm we're able to uh we work with a whole group of installers and energy efficiency contractors um in order to bring down the prices on so that customers can accept better pricing and get really good value\nSo let me turn if I might from ... from ... power she's the president there too\nIt's a major ... who is a worker owner PV squared ... square is part of this\nExplain how a bird what explain how\nTV square works with other cops in power costs to provide these kinds of resources in the community\nOh sure yeah I'm ... so we are a member of a national purchasing crops were work her own business um meaning you know you consumer coughs producer cops purchasing co ops in work off some were owned by the workers democratically governed by workers\nWere a member of other groups that were a member of a national purchasing co-op called the advocates cooperative\nThis was a cop started by a company called ... solar in Colorado or work off\nAnd it's a person go up of local stores or so we are at a scale where we are purchasing through this amicable cooperative um we're we're buying for manufacturers at the level of a lot of the big national international a company so we get the same pricing\nUh we also use that go up as a\nBest practices and information sharing tool so we've done some organizing we've organized as power in Puerto Rico project to provide power in the wake of Hurricane Maria are and we also do\n... and you're you put solar power panels in Puerto Rico how does that work\nYou know there's a number of a portable power stations TPS was a term so it's a trailer essentially with panels batteries a water purifier lockers where you can charge is not a permanent solution that sort of a disaster relief solution that's portable or when it's not needed there it can move somewhere else as well\nI interrupted you were saying more about the cooperative purchasing power of your co op with other cops to provide the same kinds of well who pricing is the big the big companies\nYeah so I mean that's equipment first thing we ... we also use this call up as a information resource sharing so there's a lot of discussion of you know best practices with a ... type of technical question or how to create new business models a lot of information shared between the different crops that are part of this larger ...\nYou mentioned the big companies do they present an ongoing threat to local co ops smaller clubs like yours\nI think we're fortunate to be in Massachusetts one of the best states for solar in the country so it's very easy to save money here it's also very easy for business as a matter of time to come in and set up and and try and do things here I think they're working with someone local uh represents a really different value to people here people care about it and it also\nJust make financial sense because you're buying into a a long term basically power generation plan and you want to work with someone that you trust who's going to be here in five years even if the market changes um so that said yeah I mean there's there's a lot of people uh do you want to talk so sort of us or you talked a lot of different companies are certainly competition\nBut the local companies use they provide a service that these big companies the big chain companies which will happily sell you a some kind of solar panels and a contract out of the big box stores they can't you off or something they don't\nYeah I mean first of all we're based here so everyone who work with these are the people we see here in the grocery store river valley or frankly when you go up\nOr we want to be able to look in the eye and and not her head's right so we try and get it right the first time we make a mistake we fix it you're not talking to a a call center out of state when you have a problem you're talking to someone who lives in the same town as you are an eighties case the same neighborhood has me yes\n[laughter] you just have to get the solar Monday and come [laughter] [laughter] during the house I [laughter]\nA a creative solutions\nTo the problem with ... lack of so are we going to move his house so let me turn if I might to Robin O'Brian from the putting the food co-op where she's the general manager because during the break we were talking about numbers Robin you mentioned I think quite amazing number involving the button a food co-op share that with our listeners if you would please\nSo we had Seventeen hundred members um and we live in a town of about twenty six hundred people so that's um I think probably one of the highest proportions of owner ... member owners to a population that caught can claim\nAnd why does did or does that happen why does that how why\nWell in our town ... ... is the only grocery store and I\nMy my goodness these cops this monopoly a whole new concept [laughter] um\nAnd we truly are a hub we represent our community and in a lot of ways and we're very much involved um in ways of helping people close that gap on food access we're involved with the food shelf we um help out with that the school food pantry and a few other things\nWhile on the in the world of extraordinary numbers I'd like to turn to show a printing who is the general manager of the river valley co-op where we are broadcasting live this our annual co-op show quite amazing numbers as well from the river valley car share those\nOh sure um we are ten years old we have nearly ten thousand

zero annual sales to a a little over twenty eight million in annual sales and we had expected that we might do Thirteen million by our tenth here when we were opening ten years ago\nThat's a lot of money\n[laughter] it's it's been really it's been a lot of sales that's a lot of local farmers selling them here\nYeah it's a over six million dollars that we purchase a locally from local farmers in local food producers um and and that that number has remained\nAnd about a third of our total purchases pretty much since the second year we open so as a store has grown\nProgram but he does have a

S. dot com Mrs\nOn Mars Mars show\nOne of those may be [laughter]\n\nHonestly\nHave welcome back in the Mars Mars\nAnd I decided to visit with my friend Dr\nHenry Miller who's a senior fellow at the Pacific resurgence he's\nPublished in the popular press and its scholarly journals as well a dock it's good to have you back welcome to the program\nCraig to be with you a large thank you\nBefore we get into this discussion about dark regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter is\n[noise] yeah well you know dark matter it's often a referred to as a the set of tools\nThat the so called deep state or dark state choose to carry out their own agendas sometimes independent in the intention of Congress or of the administration that they're supposed to be working for and I'm In the context\nOf a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of ways that they can get around the specified procedures for carrying out their work so I'm One example is um regulatory discretion\nAnd and that means that um they have discretion within what the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals much too\nAnd the the most egregious example of that with which your listeners will be familiar\nWas a then the FBI Director Comey's decision an announcement that I'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions with respect to a ... ... email a private ... her private email server and so on it not meet\nThe criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the classify handling classified information\nUm but there there are all sorts of examples in the in the regulatory community so I'm\nA ... for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime and yet it's not prosecuted at all in a amounts per individual used in states like Colorado and California so there is a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it is it called the Golan agreement that was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively said\nAll right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use\nBut at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says\nThe agreement is null and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband\nPot to be shipped out of the state into other states that have not agreed to legalize it so at least those states get some protection but just some of this regulatory dark matter also happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion\nUh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to give it\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem a so that I'm a ... FDA for example does this all the time and and a good example is another kind of regulatory dark matter\nIt is a pack up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issue in some guidance documents or memoranda were announcements instead or formal role making formal role mimicking specifies that there has to be an announcement on the federal register\nPublic comment consideration of public comment and then finally station of the of the rule but the agencies often\nGet around that by issuing\nGuidance documents and then uh within the uh the guidance that they specify which is often new policy making new law making that really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify caught carve outs\nFor enforcement discretion within that and that uh sometimes a bridge too far too much autonomy that was never contemplated for a for regulatory agencies and yet they do this\nThey do this all the time some guidance is good so that for example if the ... as the food truck than ... medical or a law that says ah there have to be a pre approval inspections of drug menu pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities\nBut uh but guidance documents can tell the industry what the nature of those are in a tablet Schmidt\nInspections will big do they have to be announced or can they be unannounced are they supposed to avoid disrupting the pharmaceutical production or how long should they last a court should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good\nBut uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy which is far beyond what anyone contemplated and it wasn't that brings go ahead do and\nAnd that and that brings up the sort of a conflict if you get regulatory agencies to much autonomy\nOr you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you give them too little you have found a unable to adjust to situations new technologies new situations that might arise\nSo what's the best way of raining it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rent it in it as we've discussed in other context is for Congress to exercise and performance oversight responsibilities a much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nDoc I'll tell you this this stuff drives me nuts because I guess I expect that people who work in the federal government and pull a federal paycheck out of the public treasury\nWhat ... people of good faith and to some extent I imagine there are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think my federal job is not just a great paycheck integrate pension but it's my license to go out and fix things to be the way I think they ought to be instead of the way\nThat I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I frankly don't care I didn't like the choice of rock Obama\nBut I also didn't suggest that well if you didn't like rock Obama than you should work from within whatever agency work and to try to sabotage his policies which I don't think I've done very much\nA but people are certainly trying to sabotage the policies of ah of Donald Trump\nAnd make sure that his policies don't happen and when they do that as far as I'm concerned they're spinning in the face of the voters\nWho approved Donald

Jim V. [noise]\n\nBack Marcia Marcia join a First Amendment friday night you know a few years ago she ... and I got to\nDo something that I look forward to the opportunity to do for a long long time but I got a chance to go down to Mississippi and try to help them and become a United States senator and it didn't happen that time and I think honestly the man was cheated out of an opportunity\nOr by a senator who labeled himself a Republican but actually acted more like a Democrat\nWell Senator Chris McDaniel is back at it he is now a Mississippi State senator who is running for the United states and and he joins Mennonite a shuttered McDaniel state senator Mitch Daniels it's good to have you back on the program and uh I Want to see this wouldn't come out differently if you don't mind\nYeah absolutely and thank you for having you know a four years ago we we had that race and you remember what happened we thought the good fight of the night of the primary we one fifty nine\nOf the Republican vote but because of shenanigans\nThey pushed forty thousand Democrats into the Republican primary and the Democrats elected our nominee and then as you know how the establishments works they can't they just right for us to talk with to step down and then they hand selected another Democrat for the seat so here we are\nBack in a very similar city fight here at the city so it's really great to be or\nWould you mind to explain to my audience how it is this complicated that Mississippi ends up with the system in which Republicans can have their choices taken away from them by Democrats across the aisle\nYou know it's remarkable we helped is very conservative state outlays joke with the campaign trail if you can't find a conservative to sit in the United States Senate from Mississippi where he got to find one it's not going to be from Massachusetts California it's been safe but what happens here we have a large lobbying presence because of Haley Barbour another is at the party and\nThey will keep that gravy train movie and what they do is they find a these are so called Republicans who are really big government Republicans they believe that ...\nThat spin date in big tax scene and another liberal concepts but they hide behind that are on the Mississippi over the years we've always managed to health conscious that the vigils and yet we still remain dead last economically speaking so what we're just in this\nAnother direction we think that this state can do better we know it can't\nJust do away with the good old boy club with a lobbyist and the cronies and reimpose liberty for everybody and that's what we're trying to do\nSo how's the race going at this point what are the polls show\nVery well the polls are all over the place I mean I you know what do you do with polls I'm Donald Trump we told they told us he had an ... percent chance of losing any one show\nOr some polls have us up or there's a pact poll shows us up eight to ten years or NBC poll shows us down five other polls are being whispered about that showed up two or three\nWho knows what I Do know that we have all the momentum and the reason I Know that is we can feel the buzz on the ground and guess what will run against someone who was a life time Democrats you served three terms in the states it as a Democrat she's voted for Hillary Clinton has this all\nDemocrats that grounded fact before she came back to see it being ran for state Senate she was a federal law did she lobbied to help to organization that pushed for Obamacare and pushed for\nUniversal healthcare so when people find that out about the appointed senator guess what they rush away in droves and they run toward our campaign that's the only conservative and the way so as long as we're spread that message that people here in it where when it\nSo tell me this uh a columnist recently said that your star is fading so how many how many how you've closed the gap between now and election day\nWe got to drive a we have to drive interest that obviously there's a ... there are there's also just a a a a person the individual component there were people have to talk to their neighbors make phone calls and inspired Mississippi the skit out to vote and I would disagree with the stars fading\nThe establishment spent ... million dollars a negative I Can't speak it twenty fourteen\nThey know that ... billion dollars at this time to be so Fifteen million dollars in negative money in a small state like Mississippi\nAll to drive me away and what's the big problem I'm a conservative I'm trying to hold them accountable and they don't want to be held accountable I don't think my story's going anywhere as long as the people on a champion that wants to fight or I'm going to be that guy\nTell me this do you think that the Kavanaugh hearings are going to have any kind of effect because I I understand that there were senators who they're a lot of the focus on Murkowski and flake and Collins and ... and and yet\nI also wondered about the effect that it was going to have when people and especially conservatives like Mississippi looked at this even if you're a Democrat and a bit conservative and you said\nGosh I don't want my son or daughter held to this kind of standard where a single false accusation with such thin evidence even if it was basically her story and her story largely incomplete I Wonder whether that's going to have any kind of effect on the electrodes Mississippi\nWell I Hope that it does a hope that people have our state come to the conclusion that the Democrats have gone completely I'm\nCompletely to the wealthy are the worst they've lurks to so far left for their or socialists now they are Democrat more radical than they are moderate and frankly it's a dangerous party and if we don't find Republicans that can stand in the gap and not just Republicans conservatives that standard the gal to push back\nAgainst that party we're going to lose this country so we always argue\nThe days of rigid across the aisle or over the days of chastened in the class to the left or over we have to stand in the Gallup male and force discovered in the fact that the bright back toward liberty\nBack where it belongs to lose this country so I Hope\nPeople recognize how dangerous got party has become and how much we have to fight to preserve our way of life\nI'm Talking to a state senator Chris McDaniel who's running for the United States Senate from Mississippi so how can people help you out financially 'cause I Know in the closing weeks of the campaign a lot of money gets spent and oftentimes like it or not money makes the difference because of advertising and get out the vote yes\nYes sir it's a big deal to she's outspending us right now probably Fifteen to one she's got all the swamp money ... money in the U.S chamber of commerce suspended buddies out here trying to save her we just need you to help us you guys out there listening Mac Daniel twenty eight teams dot com\nGo to Daniel twenty Eighteen dot com you'll see my plants or what I Believe that and if you get a chance please come help us Mississippi would love to have a conservative US Senator and I promise you will fight for everybody\nOur Chris one last thing and that is let's assume you become the next US Senator from the state of Mississippi I'd be pleased by that because I'd love to see you get there I I Know you've got the right values and and I I fully endorse your candidacy but but tell me the circuit in what are you going to be your top priorities is a brand new limited US Senator\nI think number one we ... we have to build that border wall that has to be funded number two term limits\nIt's just time to shock the system and bring some of these career politicians hole and lastly and every vote that I cast it every speech that I feel\nWe have to de centralized the power of the federal government they're bringing those powers back to the states have back to the people with those powers always belong the government is broken it's dysfunctional it's disconnected I'm sick a career politician\nIs to put the people charged again and that's with every vote that we cast we have to restructure discovered\nChris it's a pleasure I it was a pleasure to help your four years ago and my help wasn't nearly enough I Hope that this time the next time I talked to you after the November election that you are the next US Senator from Mississippi\nThank you so that means a lot to make just keep offend your prayers and uh I look forward to working with the you know one day thank you for everything\nI look forward to it Senator Chris McDaniel who's now a state senator running for the United States Senate glad to get your calls at eight six six eight Lars and that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven and if you want to measure of where America is going right now\nConsider the me too movement consider the movements that openly opposed the choice of American voters in President\nA new poll reason magazine talks about it they asked Americans about political correctness now you might get slightly different definitions of what political correctness is but I think we all understand it and it's like the old definition from the Supreme Court justice of obscenity I Can't find it but I Know it when I see it\nGreater than what he got just six or eight months before and then you say well where's your gun this year clearly he's been painted as a racist bigot for the last year and a half by the media\nHis ratings can't be very good no they're not eight percent they're not twenty three three times higher there's thirty five percent more than four times the support he got at the polls in sixteen\nAnd I think the left has looked at that and said we're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude I think towards black American voters we own these people and they're they're going off the reservation they're now supporting Trump\nI mean what are they going to say when it goes from thirty five percent to say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\nAll right so I Want to give you some data points to\nHarm me the number of votes that for that ... got a in two thousand eight set a record for the number of blacks voting for Democrats [noise] it was\nIt had been approaching a higher and higher number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand eight guess what\nWe've seen it go in the opposite direction rock Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for now many among black voters actually it's true for everybody but\nHe is the only president to be successfully reelected and receive fewer black votes than he did when he was\nFirst elected since Roosevelt\nYou name the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat they always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters no well here's what we got to see in two thousand six days\nIf you just look at black men they gave Donald Trump\nThird team per cent of their vote if in fact black women had voted the same way that black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth is\nWe hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand for this divergence you gave me some stats\nThat are accurate about the overall numbers there has been a spike among black\nMen for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive ism that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it has more than quadrupled\nWell and you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if if there's someone I highly respect who comes out and says I'm In favor of something I'm not going to avoid the I I I won't ignore the facts on the ground\nI don't always support what those I admire also support but it's the facts are there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship\nFor them so little a percent increase in the new black businesses in the last Eighteen months\nAnd then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with\nAdmirable figures for both black Americans and white Americans they ... they're going to be people who look and say well Connie likes the guy\nMay maybe I should too and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nIt was the message that everyone was supposed to understand don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive socialist agenda is being pushed forward you're better off\nWell here's an interesting data point three of the five\nWorst unemployment data points for blacks occurred during the Obama administration's guess what five records for unemployment low is since the bureau of standards have been recording it within the department of labor\nFive have heard of the lowest unemployment now we have set records in America for the number of people in just the last Eighteen month old went on their first ever think family vacation than a decade you or not\nBlack people that that doesn't matter and how do I know because Iraq Obama got fewer votes among black people when he was getting reelected they saw just like everyone else these policies don't appear to work\nYou know they jump for us it's a pleasure to have you on we'll have you back some time to talk about project Twenty one specifically but we appreciate your work with project Twenty one and also the national Center for public\nPolicy research have a great weekend like you to back adjustable I'm Glad to get your calls at eight six six four

agencies\nFor doing hidden city tickets so let's say is an example you were going to Houston and instead you might buy a ticket to Austin or San Antonio where El Paso and it might cut your

we've got efficiency we've got productivity when it comes to keeping your facility running rangers got your back color quick ranger dot com to see for yourself ranger for the ones who get it done\nIn fact the go to choice I recommend in any of the plans that I like that I've talked about on my guide\nAre for you to go in the age space portfolios\nAged base portfolios or where you put money in and based on your child's age or grand kids age or niece or nephew or whoever you're putting up the money for\nThat the mix of investments changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment in the mix unless you work as an investment professional as your day job\nSo going in the age based portfolio is what I recommend what I've done going through the plans\nAs I've looked at them to find the ones that are the absolute lowest cost because over let's say a typical investment cycle that someone's putting money on for a child's college the money sits in their roughly ten years\nBut you sound when people put money on and the money you put in through the years and so for that\nInvestment cycle the cost of the investments matter enormously how much money you'll have there for a kids' college by the time they're spending it and for tuition and other eligible expenses and undergraduate or graduate school\nSo my guide that I've just updated\nAt Clark dot com is all about driving down costs\nPeriod and the good news is that college five twenty nine plans have gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper with intense competition among those that are the direct salt\nThe ones that involve commissions again I don't even look at because they're so an economic you should never consider them but the great news is that when I first started writing about and reviewing five twenty nine plans\nLong ago the\nOf those that were good for you to put your money on was teensy tiny today in encompasses most plans sponsored by most states in the country and many states in addition to getting used to have money tax free for college you get a tax\nThe fed up front for participating in a plan\nAnd so check out my guide and it's something that I uh do partial revisions overtime and then do a major revisions to\nRoughly every Eighteen months and the reason there are times I Do partial revisions is to actually won a plan may change sponsors or the existing sponsor main lower costs or two\nI may come to believe that the decision I made about a particular state plan was wrong and I may downgrade a planner upgrade a plan on further review but the idea of this is that\nYou have an opportunity if you can afford it to put money aside to defray at least in part the cost of a child's college education and have that done the most efficient way possible tax free growth of your money\nHaving said that though\nNever sacrifice your own retirement\nIn order to put money aside for kids college your retirement comes first\nThe reason why a simple there are no scholarship plans for retirement\nBut there are many alternative ways to pay for college including the most overlooked of all and that's going to a more affordable college\nIs the number one way to reduce the costs because the dollar never had to be expended for college it was a dollar you don't have to say for it\nAnd again if the culture and your family is college is not likely for\nA kid you don't want to save in one of these plans but always save the max you're allowed to enter Ross IRA\nBefore you focus in any meaningful way on a five twenty nine\nI guess the only uh Astros that\nIs if there's a state tax benefit going into a five twenty nine if you can put in what will get you the maximum tax benefit and state in addition to the tax free growth that would make it a one and then the raw IRA funding would be a one egg\nBut anyway you can see my explanation at ... dot com the goal with my five twenty nine plan guide is this I Want you to be in a position\nTo review pick a plan\nFunded and be done\nIn less than Fifteen minutes this doesn't have to be hard it doesn't in any way need to be intimidating and you'll really be glad that you set up a plan with the goal of being to add to it\nEvery month if you can automatically to build up real money towards college\nJoe is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jill\nHi Clark how are you great Joe I Hope I can be of help to you\nI Hope so I have a question about the online I I've been listening to you and recently I took your advice and have a chunk of our savings\nTo one of the online banks and like he could get that I went to a bank rates selected one that had a good interest rate and a five star ratings but my my nagging concern is that I didn't see a direct link the banks and I had to\nGoogle it signed it and that set it up and it looks like it but I still have this nagging fear that one of these times are going to go to log into my account\nAnd money's going to a town right okay so let me tell you what the hope\nIs with a you looked at the bank Craig list with any of these lists um when if someone doesn't pay them referral fees they're not going to provide a direct like they're going to give you the information\nIs the best right out there with that is why there wasn't a hyper lengthy would take you right to it\nOK so doesn't in any way make that a a bad bank or one that you should be wary of it's just that since they wouldn't pay money any kind of commission is going to be a little more work for you to do business with them what kind of rate are you learning\nA Q and a quarter\nTo quarter already know that is I think today the highest anybody's paying is too okay yeah it it ...\nIt was when I set it up and I mean I guess my other question is since there's not a brick and mortar bank locally and I think the things that are cases supposedly based in New York but other other special safeguards that you should take when you use an online bank asked like if I'm not sure what I Would do all of a sudden I couldn't access my account the bank's website\nWhere you can always cross validate that you're dealing with real people by going to F. D. I. C. dot Gov and checking to see that it is a real institution and that you're insured to the quarter million\nAnd as long as you have to cross reference you're you're good to go and online banks are going to be a bigger and bigger part of our financial market in the United states because particularly people who have come of age in the last uh Fifteen Years\nGoing to physical bank branches just isn't part of how they do things and so the the future's going to be captured by online only institutions and what you're doing is just plain smart\nI Hope so I Am certainly seems slightly money on the table so I appreciate your get advice and and that makes me feel a little bit better\nAnd I'm curious what were you earning at the place you have the money before\n[laughter] well I had it at a credit union and and actually they are currently pay two and a half percent but only on you know up to a certain amount of money so I was getting at that interest rate on some of my savings but that was a lot out there that I wasn't gaining anything on\nWell two and a half is really great that's fantastic um I didn't know any credit unions were paying savings rates that Hi Beverly with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Beverly\nHigh Clark how are you\nGreat thank you Beverly you got a question for me to save some money\nI sure do but at first I Want to thank you for what you do I we all appreciate everything you do\nWhat you're ... and thank you\nI had a question about printers I had heard you on a more than a week ago talking about um H.

very basic hearing aids that you may be able to buy it like five hundred dollars a year okay but you can do a lot cheaper than that and get a true real hearing aid and that's what you'd like you'd like a better deal right\nWhen I'm starting to see is in the newspapers or magazines some other steering aid type of companies when I'm looking to find out if they're reputable or if there's any other recommendation that would be a little bit better priced\nOkay so there's two things you'll see in the ads one you'll see your ads that are very cleverly written that under the law the devices are not
