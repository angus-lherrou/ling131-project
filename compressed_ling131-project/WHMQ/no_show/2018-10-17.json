Azerbaijan from food energy to a knowledge economy the republic of advice on in the Caspian Sea bass is a region well worth exploring I welcome my colleague John Tammy to comment on the news\nIn these last days you might have noticed\nThat the Federal Reserve has been raising rates for some time now which is consistent with it what it believes it his mission to worry about inflation and employment at the same time also you might have noticed that Mario Draghi the central banker for all of the European Union\nIs commenting unhappily about the Italian watch it and how this may or may not be acceptable to the European Union\nIn response to this in the American market there was a dramatic sell off in these last week of of the most popular stocks especially apple and everything else including small cap in Europe they've been selling off for some time and everybody is in tears over breakfast or no Brexit\nJohn I welcome you tonight because over many years now you and I just got central bankers the Federal Reserve\nAnd how they relate to the news cycle and what I've learned from you is that they don't relate to the news cycle it's just our understanding that when the Federal Reserve speaks in some fashion we must react I'm going to guess that I can extend that to the central banker of Europe Mario Draghi\nExplain again John how it is that the central bankers have so much power who is who warships them where is this cold and how to how do we get out of it good evening to you John\n... well John I think economists worship\nCentral banks central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information for reporters who are trying to create a narrative about what's happening in the markets and the economy\nPlus remember just as an example economists almost to a man and woman thing that all the maiming killing and wealth destruction that was World War two hadn't upside called\nEconomic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the Fed's\nInterest rate hiking its its attempts to hike the short\nRate of credit which is really all this as a target has somehow out of nowhere spook markets for such a view isn't serious not only is the fed and not a race setter the fed is a rape follower of the fed follows markets and moves up its rate based on what the markets are doing but we have to remember\nInvestors have known for at least a year or two that the fed was going to do what it's doing so the idea that investors would just now be reacting to what's been known for quite some time isn't serious the markets story is not a fed story but that's the story that the media liked to promote is that is what economists tell them is the story\nInstead I said John first of all thanks to choosing Whalen

you by the Republicans have I shot from food to energy into a knowledge of kind of the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in the region well with exploring I welcome Josh broken riding global opinion\nWashington Post and we start now\nMissing perhaps murdered a journalist for the Washington Post in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul we start with the number one hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nAnd now claimed asserted by the Trump Administration that is part of the mystery of Russia okay\nJosh I'm very good evening to you one hundred and ten billion dollars sizeable and the president was commenting on it most recently in his interview with sixty minutes this hundred and ten billion dollars is a guaranteed as Congress part of this conversation about\nSaudi Arabia are arms sales are GDP our jobs and the murder of a journalist good evening to\nOh good evening John the issue of us arms sales to Saudi Arabia is back in the news because members of Congress in both parties on both chambers\nHave are looking for ways to exert pressure on the Saudi regime to give up information about the disappearance of ... and uh this is the thing that they think that they can use to\nUm at at least try to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in a investigation and the way that sheds light on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and of course when President Trump was asked about this immediately said no no no we can't\nDo that you know his excuse is reasons were that it would affect us jobs and that Saudi Arabia might turn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump likes these arms sales because he tells them as a major achievement\nIn the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he introduced himself a mostly because when he went to Riyadh on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThe this is what the big announcement was this was the big delivery boy this is what he says the itchy now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated\nSome of it it feels that have been in the pipeline through the Obama administration some event are aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that where those deals are actually moving but those deals that are actually moving are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional process to and there's no way that in this current environment without\nSome sort of resolution to the question of the Saudi regime role and is\nYour most parents that Congress is going to let this happen now what I argued today in the Washington Post very simple but you know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually\nKnow this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic he's turned it into Saudi leverage on us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now\nPlays the ... states in a position where any country who is selling us arms has it easy get out of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates our norms are rights or you know the rights of our citizens and residents and\nWeak as it is a but it could have far reaching effects and uh it definitely doesn't help six or Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh trying to get the Saudis to play ball and back here in Washington President Trump is just taking quiver arrows out of his quiver\nDisappears a genuine geostrategic paradox Josh\nI mentioned that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran we also have to deal with Ankara\nAnd then there was the Gulf Cooperation council so there are crossed purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with a wrong\nAnd I've puzzled about Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't taboos Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nWell you're right there's no doubt that a a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up\nUndermines the Trump administration's main\nDiplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off around in oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil and given that we're not working with the Europeans on that really you know the goal fees are the ones that are going to have to\nTeam up with us this Iran strategy that Trump is already announcing already done is is ... it has any chance of being an success\nSo yes it's a pickle you know there is no clear way out of this for the Trump Administration their tactics right now seems to be a bit to try to avoid you coming to the point where they have to make a decision whether or not to punish the Saudis different when we actually discovered that they did this thing to me that they have this thing um it\nUndermines Trump's administration's plans to\nRoll out of a Middle East peace plan because that Middle East peace plan is based according to the White House on getting Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries to throw in and also undermines the effort that Jared 'cause you're always talks about to build the middle east security alliance an Arab NATO out\nThe critics they made attrition will say that all of these policies were destined to fail your\nAnyway the Palestinians are not going to come to the table while the Trump restrictions punishing them there's very little chance Iran is going to come back to the table negotiate a deal and Saudi Arabia itself blew up the idea\nSo to speak their choice of words you of having a Middle East NATO when they started embargo against Qatar so you know if you believe that there was a reasonable chance ... ministers are pulling off his hat trick of really complicated difficult policies the middle east\nYou have to see that this crisis hurts their ability to do all sorts of things that you can understand why the White House is resisting dealing with his head on\nJosh it's possible we been on this road for some time and the reports from Yemen about the indiscriminate bombing and the aggression by the the by the surrogates for Saudi Arabia for Riyadh\nHave been have have troubles Congress for a long time and it looks like that's all now galvanized with the murder of the journalists but it isn't it isn't an isolated complain about Saudi Arabia\nRight and you know the there is no doubt that there are some\nA lot of people who already had issues with us Saudi relationship we are now taking the opportunity of this crisis to push forward an agenda they are the worst namely to break up the he was\nSaudi alliance in ... that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely concerned about the disappearance of tomorrow which are a lot of people that begins to create a momentum that could actually have the effect of changing me when I started really we don't know\nHow it's all going to turn out or you know it's sort of Americans generally gives the government a pass to do things or national security\nThat have collateral damage and you know that doesn't really affect the American soldiers right so if the Saudis are killing a lot of innocent people in Yemen you know there there's not a big likelihood that your your average American there for the average congressman is going to raise the ...\nAnd that but when something like this that and I can sometimes have the effect of wrong the public's attention\nTo our allies Saudi Arabia and Regis ... isn't a ranger front in a unique way crystallized that for people okay and this is kind of blend\nThe relationships change and when you know a a a small movement in Congress to stop the U.S aid to Saudi Arabia and the Yemen War to really gained momentum and I think that's what you're saying happening right now\nJosh ... for the Washington Post I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nOh\n[noise]

H. B. [noise]\nThe IPC is measuring the forest fires will deepen because of global warming can we make ... to ... to ... Richard\nNo this look you're talking about changes in temperature at the global level now which are running in under ten ... degrees\nA tenth of a degree in a year would be an enormous civil or is this just in the last Eighteen years increase has probably been in the order of about one tenth of a degree and I was standing at Thirteen percent increase in carbon dioxide levels what really determines forest fires are a bunch of other things\nLike the much of a\nBasically fungible material fish unable material burn up all material which gathers\nAnd if you were to improve the management the public lands for example would make a much greater difference in this severity of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nOr the contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed plans are very very great if you look at the aggregate I went back and check some of these numbers forest fires down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred\nIt's a striking decline that is going on and so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that\nDay but you have to do is to get aggregate data\nIn the aggregate data doesn't support the claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow or other would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage forests than a more sensible fashion\nIs wildly older brought you're looking at the wrong thing there are now solutions that would work better even way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there are many many things that can be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PCC is talking\nAbout hurricanes so our side clubs the allegation is made that they will deepen and increased in severity and striking land you provide a chart in your defining ideas these\nThat suggests we're not looking at increases we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to guess that we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYes generally speaking the data gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier\nBut it's the same thing and they were huge hurricanes in Nineteen forty five I still remember living through hurricane hazel in Nineteen fifty for not attributing it's a global warming\nThe worst storm ever to hit mainland United States is still the Galveston hurricane of Nineteen thirty\nOf Nineteen hundred oh there are pictures of Houston being flooded and twenty six Tina twenty Seventeen they're also pictures of Houston being flooded in Nineteen thirty five and they're essentially the same kind of picture the cyclical phenomena are pretty much\nUniform with respect to everything that we look at and the basic problem the global warming theorists is\nIf in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down you can't explain the ups and downs by a movement in carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually up with over very long period of time since I got to get other forces to explain what's going on\nWhen Richard Lewis and gave his lecture and England but he said it's you know there are a bunch of other forces like water vapor is for example that can be doing it and there are other things that are local which do this so if you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works it's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very well you have\nAny source or significance as carbon dioxide\nThe dependent variable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as the rainiest this law which says that given certain insensitivity assumptions as carbon dioxide changes\nYou take the law for them to the base to the base the um it means that you're going to get a slower than linear increase in the amount of carbon dioxide but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that water vapor is probably the more powerful greenhouse gas anything you do to change\nMay be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lowered and you don't see anything whatsoever the ... the\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent cost benefit analysis of where we go my own do all this stuff is\nIt you can basically have orderly technological progress of based upon other kinds of considerations and\nIf you reduce the amount of pollution if in the end you managed to increase the efficiency of all the legal or the business infrastructure systems we have this problem will not quote unquote take care of itself but it's wildly overstated there is nothing whatsoever in the past record of climactic changes\nThat points to the sort of dramatic need for intervention which the PCC suggests\nRichard

we're talking about we saw the ... the elected officials no this is a real proposal this really on Rican hill that really has been that they really couldn't vote on and fund\nYes that's right yes it has a funding formula with end the bell which is one of the things that some of the other state bills have not had and have run into trouble but they're still has the funding formula within it\nDoes Charlie Baker have a position on the on the bill and or on the ballot question and I would like you to explain to us who's either best who your I'm Sorry ... explain to us why it's only on the ballot in our district or a few districts in this election cycle\nWestern mass Medicare for all worked\nOn getting it on the ballot in sixth district and the western part of the state that is not something that other district chose to do at this point\nAnd the six districts you talking about a representative districts or\nAs the representative districts the ones currently represented by cool ask mark they got Solomon roadside back and the district that was represented by ... so all of the western mass districts basically that's not in Springfield\nAnd if this were to pass let's say the question for on or about receives an overwhelming yes vote in November which I Would hope for and expect does that\nActually advance the cause does that make it more likely that this bill received favorable consideration in the legislature anytime soon or is this simply statement of here we are we're western mass and we are standing up for the rights of the people but Charlie Baker is going to blow us off with\nWell it doesn't it doesn't you know there's nothing in the question\nThat I and I don't I don't mean to district ...\nSorry but I did notice that the recent polls have you way behind Jay wonderful as you may be\n[laughter] um [noise] so it doesn't it doesn't call for advancing the bail it simply calls for legislators to vote on the bill and there are many many steps that would come before voting for the bill\nFor instance I mentioned that this they'll spend and the legislature for Twenty years on what has happened in each of those Sessions is that it gets stuck and they helped Finance Committee so\nAlthough this was a bill that has received specific and devoted attention from representative Peter ... who was I think really working on moving forward and the legislative process\nIn a way that it hadn't moved in previous years and of course is yet on time we and said this is willy interfered with that\nProcess he had become co chair of the health financing committee so that was going to be very helpful [noise] let me ask this\nMedicare for all would you as you describe it have this one governmental entity\nOverseeing health care expenditures that writes let's start there yes yes okay and I'd like some more details on how Medicare for all would actually work or are we talking about something that looks like the\nCanadian system or something that looks like the\nA system in in England was his national health service are we talking about something different how\nWhat does it look like ... ... as a system\nRight well I think what's unique about Massachusetts approach is that everyone under this bill\nBut we'll changes that any moneys collected to pay hospitals doctors services labs all of those things nursing services\nWould come from one place on the Massachusetts trust it so and it would be run by people who are voted for appointed representing our every area of every kind of a dynamic in any um group of people in Massachusetts\nBut what happens is the ... all the ... the funds will still pay for the same hospitals the same doctors you get to keep your doctor you get it to um have all of that services that you have in your community it doesn't change the services\nIt doesn't change your doctor is your doctors will still take care of you um what all that changes is that the health insurance companies will not be making decisions about your health care they will no longer exist in a way in which they're controlling night the the cash that's moving into to payments\nSo it's it's much more like the Canadian system than it is like the u._k. system because that's a that's a national health service that doctors and other providers work for the government here if this would the doctors would still work for themselves everybody with work you know privately but the funding would be public through this health care trust\nIt strikes me perhaps being just a bit naive here that the insurance companies would not take kindly to this\nIt strikes me perhaps being just a bit naive here the the insurance companies would not take kindly to this a bill now and so I'm Wondering how\nIt would actually be implemented in other words in for an employer let's let's say a decent employer has a healthcare plan with a\nAn ethno or one of the other insurance companies and the employees say wait a second I don't love my health plan because it is really hard to ... to ... and it's very expensive for me and my contributions or really painful to me but at least it's a health care plan if this bill were to pass\nAnd I vote for centuries vote for it or for my weight behind it by voting yes on question for what would happen to my plan with my employer\nWould not be plans with employers or anything but the um plant would be financed as it's written now in the bill the plan would be financed by a payroll tax so employers would pay a piece of that and employees would pay a piece of that\nAnd when employers have still have an option to have a health plan or those health plans for employers would essentially at least overtime a disappear and be replaced by the coverage through Medicare for all I miss\nEverybody would be covered by Medicare for also employers you know it employers would be paying less than they are paying now so they're paying their pain halo tax but they're not paying they wouldn't pay as much as the typical employer pays at this time\nLike an administrative costs every employer has to have that pays the cost of negotiating a plan having someone I'm at having people actually distribute the information\nDo the marketing I'm In many employers offer many plans so it's a huge costume players right now both small employers in large employers so that cost would be eliminated\nI understand that and I understand that within the system you actually would go down from\nSome eight nine or ten percent which are the administrative costs throughout the healthcare system now for all these individual insurance at minimum minimum down to one maximum two percent which is in the ministry of overhead for Medicare I understand that there's enormous savings and all of that\nThat's sad what I'd like to know is whether or not there would be a difference in ... insurance coverage in other words we all hear well this person has a basic plan that person has a Cadillac plan where does Medicare for all were\nWhat's what's the everybody in the commonwealth would have the same plan so once you're born until you die you would be eligible for the same plan\n[noise] well I think that's really helpful because and I didn't know that because I remember just simply\nHow when President Nixon\nIntroduced a bill that looked very much like what is Romneycare or Obamacare\nThat the Democrats including Ted Kennedy and what he said it was the worst mistake and his legislative a long and distinguished legislative career\nOpposed it because it wasn't good enough mhm because it wasn't Medicare for all essentially called something else at the time but nonetheless that bill Obamacare Romneycare wasn't good enough and the unions were opposed to it because\n... medical coverage health insurance coverage was something that unions negotiated for and it was an important part of the what they offer to their membership so\nAlthough unions are not nearly as strong and powerful and they were then uh I still think that's a significant change them\nThe concept of um health insurance coverage came from the way ... years ago in Detroit and when it became like when we had very large employers and\nThe economy was healthy and that was something that we offered are are um workers but\nThe economy's changed and healthcare has changed and we don't have those big employers anymore so we have a system that doesn't work for us anymore so it's a it's really historically um health insurance provided by employers has been what we're stuck with but I'm\nRight the employer based system yeah because that's where large numbers of people in a single place in an enormous factory for example ... I Would like to know this we hear a lot about how the Massachusetts budget is spending was devoting forty plus percent either Medicaid or Medicare\nA lot about how the Massachusetts budget is spending\nWas devoting forty plus percent either Medicaid or Medicare in other words health insurance in one form or another and I'm Wondering whether there is an economic impetus for this for Medicare for all now this year or in the coming a meat in the immediate future\nThat wasn't present before that and yes we're ...\nPercent of yes I think that that's really true as as as the health insurance and health care industry\nJust takes up more and more as a budget of the state but also more and more of the budget of cities and towns and school districts school districts are incredible and towns are incredibly bird and my health care costs not only for courage and plays\nBut for retired employees all of that would go away under this plan because everybody would just have their own coverage they wouldn't need to be covered through there and for you know through their school or retirees wouldn't need to be covered that way so there is beginning to really be a push from the ...\nAnd from school districts to really think about getting them out from under that so that they can you know teach and six roads and the other things we need\nI I think that the the question I asked my raises another question in the minds of some\nListeners you use the term Medicare we use the term Medicaid they're very different and I'm Wondering if you could explain the difference than what they are to our listeners\nMedicare is a federal program for uh people over sixty five this is as it is now of course yes as if he's got it by the government but\nIt's a it's a plan for retired people and also for disabled people that is something that is you know paid into by by ... by the federally administered\nAnd I'm Medicaid or met at the Massachusetts version as of mass house as an income based program that is funded in part by the federal government and in part by the state\nAnd in Medicare for all Medicaid and Medicare would all be essentially covered by one program\nYeah that would be the ultimate goal there there's a provision in the bell for I'm getting our Medicare the fund said that the state has paid into Medicare at the federal level there's provision for getting that money back the current administration is probably not going to do that\nAnd there might need to be a a separate program for people who have the current Medicare\nI'm as this as this starts but ultimately the plan is that everybody undifferentiated by age or employment status or non income or anything else would all be under the same\nThing it does strike me that you're going to need federal government cooperation your because Medicare is Medicare uh age based is funded either significantly you're totally by the federal government whereas Medicaid is significant federal reimbursement but it also has substantial state\nFunds as well so won't you need in order to have Medicare for all to cover the people who are sixty five\nAnd older I'm not saying I have any special interest in this but um yeah [laughter] but\nOnce in a lemonade Medicare payments and still exist okay well it it it\nIt's unclear how that will exactly be worked out and they will need to be some relationship between the federal government and the state about that but it's unclear how that that's one of the many things that you know that will be looked at shut the bell come out of the house\nOkay so let's come back to them and their how do we liberate the bill from watchers of the joint committee on health care finance how can you get a bill out of art that build joined [laughter]\nOnto the floor\nOf the house and the Senate in the great general court of the commonwealth of Massachusetts so we can at least have a debate on what is the biggest item in the state budget which is by far which is medical coverage health insurance coverage\nWestern mass medical Medicare for all is building a grassroots movement that's extending to the east to has been going on for many many years and Beth spin speaking around the western mass area ... twice a week\nAnd very very many forums about this along with I'm Deborah eleven ... and John waste and some others\nUm and we have been able to educate people where we're at educating and moving that concept through these this ballot initiative\nWhich will ultimately build this grassroots movement and we're seeing people come out and talking about it we already have\nA organizers who are canvassing in the neighborhoods in western mass and talking to people about it and we're getting incredibly strong positive responses and this is happening in Massachusetts but it's happening in many states across the country and in in much the same fashion but we're seeing a huge increase in interest and\nPeople more and more people are coming out and talking about it and but we need to push that energy toward legislators now we have some legislators who are very much interested in moving this concept so we see the movement building in coalescing and I it's only going to move forward\nAnd you know isn't it it's very important that people vote yes on question for\nBecause that really lets our legislators know that this is a priority for us and we really really want them\nTo be to be working on this and so there's the ones who are already in favor and then there are the ones who are lesson favorite who really also need to hear from us chats how it's going to happen by the voices of people rising up that's the only way\nSeems to me that Massachusetts which was the nation on what was then Romneycare and became Obamacare in fact can lead the nation again and\nHorrifying as the seasons when Trump take in his Republican accolades take away health insurance coverage for millions of people which they are intent on doing after the midterms if they can get away with it\nIn ... and I'd always been darkest before the dawn that will in fact I think really motivate millions and millions of Americans say we need a system that's going to work that's going to provide health insurance coverage for everyone\nIn the United states it's a human rights it's not some kind of a privilege it's the twenty first century and healthcare is human rights and Medicare for all the answer vote yes on question for petty healing\nBest Eisenberg thanks for all your work their members of western Massachusetts Medicare for all question for will prevail here by a large margin

T. as David said that I was like oh [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business is gonna go how how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow it's going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent\nYou know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you for the business\nI'm a combination of a sudden some cash and to some some alone and so we wouldn't be investing in a franchise is is there out we're going to go and then uh we have twenty percent down saved away for the home if they needed a way we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be cash flow positive and how many months do they tell you\nI had a rather than anything they show is their best guy there were gay and their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and have either you

franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months mhm\nBecause you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to a experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all done\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk you there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time\nThat of lemonade or issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning a now operating it\nYeah

eight or ... was starting to work part time for and so forth\nSo he set a schedule time than him in a representative from this company came on Oprah to sell kinda pitch life insurance and uh besides life insurance she'll funds and getting out of debt and that sort of and of course at the end uh\nKinda pitched a little bit about how they were top fifty and a rapist forms on your stock exchange that they are on and how I could work for them so folks with that\nThose are the pay was not about necessarily buying the products although they like that but you selling for them as well\nCorrect okay they catch it seemed like was you'd have to pay nine dollars\nFor a background check and what they stated a and from there are a twenty five dollar technology see if he chose to use the

there's nothing okay rip off or weird about them what you should know is that\nWhen people call me and the other side where they're saying hey I've had the salesperson offer me these mutual fund should I buy them and on that score I've said they're very very high cost funds so if you were coming to me\nAs a customer for the product\nI Would tell you why is not a product I'm excited about it all OK but as far as selling it's not a scam it's not a rip off\nUm it's just inexpensive way for someone to start to build up investments for the future and to buy insurance\nSo okay does that help at all that's all it does what does that make you think you want to do\nI Do like my normal job right now I if it's a if it's not the best product that I don't want to and you're supposed to be helping families out show comfortable maybe sound that product it's not the best product out there for them\nGot it okay good for you and it is I'm Glad you have a specific reason that you're able to give them other than say will Clark set I shouldn't do it but not a bad okay [laughter] I got enough of that going on [laughter] Andrew with us on the car coward show hello Andrew\nHello Clark how're you great thank you you have your retirement plan with tea or\nA that's correct yes are\nYou a teacher a college professor or work for a nonprofit how'd you end up with them\nI was a teacher for fourteen years in public schools but I'm a college professor of seven years at this point so\nAnd so the the University You're at offers to your retirement plans\nThat's correct and they're very generous to they contribute to eight percent a year to our retirement and uh in addition to that I I haven't been contributing roughly seven percent to that same retirement\nAnd the question I had for you as if that is really the best thing for me to do because the eight percent is really not match it gets contributed whether I contribute or not\nAnd I also have to credit card debt or that my family is a build up over the past couple of years because of some health issues and medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had to have repaired a\nWhile I'm Sorry yeah we've had a lot to deal with how much you\nWell yeah but I mean life necessities you know you take care of the ... at any chairs so uh so we have five but now we're I'm I'm sort of at the point where I I Need to sort of figure out the best way to eliminate that credit card debt and I was wondering\nIf I were best be served to pull that seven percent that I put into my retirement and use it to help pay that credit card debt off and I guess the overarching question is would I be better to even be putting any money into this ... or would I be better with Iraq wants this credit card\nI Know you know the the plan that Iran with T a is so low cost\nDid and it comes automatically out of your check I'm really comfortable with doing that and at some point she may offer some form of a Roth for three be\nInstead of going to traditional and you could consider at that time going into the raw version but going from the seven percent you're putting in to zero and just picking up with the employer puts in what the university puts in there to concerns I have that I'll just lay out to you\nOne is that\nOnce you've reduce it to zero it's hard to get back to putting the money aside for your future and all the time you have that you're not putting money and you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow for you\nThe second thing is that and I'm Sorry both of these are so negative what I'm saying I just got away I'm Out the other is a lot of times if somebody does let's say take it down to zero and then you have that seven percent that Sal added to your check\nWould be a little less than seven 'cause it would be pretty tax money going and now the net effect team maybe like five percent more bump into your take home\nIs does that five percent actually make it to the credit card bills are not a lot of times the money will somehow vanished before it goes to pay those bills\nSo you've got to know yourself shore or compromise would be what if you cut your contribution to let's say three percent from seven\nSo you're still contributing to your retirement and you use the difference to go towards the credit card debt\nOkay and that's a thought 'cause you'd still be saving roughly eleven cents out each dollar with the employer money put in and what what you're putting in\nAnd then you can put your focus on getting that credit card debt pay down and I wish you the best with the uh with the medical situations and with the house\nAnd you're able to get this debt wiped clean\nYou know it's so important to me that you have access to

going around pretending to be from the registrars office or accounting office or whatever at schools and universities\nMales going around pretending to be from the registrars office or accounting office or whatever at schools and universities saying there's an unpaid bill now some of these are quite sophisticated they are aware of\nWhere your child goes to school or if you yourself earn role in the most sophisticated versions is they know the institution\nThat someone's enrolled at for college or at a private school so I think our core courageous that is as you're already having to pay tuition\nYou pay to if you think are the right people and you get money taken from you that is no fun at all if you get any kind of notice saying that you owe money for tuition and to click on a link to pay it\nDo not click on that link to pay\nInstead go to the school website itself outside of that email and check to make sure that there is actually an outstanding balance\nAnd maybe there is an outstanding balance and if there is at that point then you can pay it however you would from inside the school or universities website but don't ever ever not ever pay inside that out because\nWell not a I'm Sorry app inside that email\nBecause the link may be completely fraudulent and your money takes a one way trip never to be recovered\nAnd I have recovered from taking my teenager off to college and she's settled in now and having\nGreat time I've been asked by so many people how things are going for Steffi and she is beyond waited\nIn her first week off at college and it was sad leaving her there but I'm so glad for her and the great experience she should have over these next four\nYears remember that Steffi complete your degree in four years you're listening to the Clark

you know who else does these\nThe discover card people cause lifetimes discover has a hard time getting people to use their cards but all they want to do is make money from interests anyway so they will do personal loans where you can take out\nThe existing balance on a credit card you have\nAnd potentially get a lower rate on a personal up and again all these people use a sliding scale based on your credit score if your credit score is falling off a cliff\nNone of these people are going to lend you money or lend you money to good rate but if the issue is you're running balances paying high interest and have a good credit score\nThan doing a re fi into these personal loans would be great to tell you it's not great though\nDo not do not\nUse the cards once you pay them off\nPut them in the deep freeze follow my freezer bag rule get a freezer bag put water in it put your cards and seal that freezer bag throw it in your freezer because the idea is to pay off the money you oh at a lower interest rate not to just borrow more money\nRick is with us on the car coward show Hi Rick\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call how ya doing\nGreat thank you Ricky wanna talk credit cards\nI Do my wife and I wanted to uh\nClark thanks for taking my call how you doing\nGreat thank you ... you want to talk credit cards\nI Do my wife and I wanted to apply for a new credit card to use strictly for our online purchases and uh the only way that we've seen to be able to apply for that card is on line\nAnd so we went on line to fill out the application and our Social Security number or my Social Security number was required\nAnd you know we've always heard that you know never ever give out your Social Security number especially online so that is that legit to they can they require a Social Security\nCard yeah 'cause they've got to what I was just talking about with the credit scores they've got to run your credit and all credit reports and scores work based on your Social Security number\nOkay because it's been so long since we've applied for a credit card I mean it was back in the paper days\nNo way really oh yeah oh yeah I mean we have\nI don't know there is a way to fly by paper anymore\n[noise] well that that was the problem we couldn't find we couldn't find out how to get an application so uh I mean we've had you know there's cars we've had for well over Twenty years\nAnd now are very loyal customer you know whoever you end up getting a card from it will be to their advantage to have you because there's a big expense for the banks getting a new credit card customer\nI've seen estimates as high as six hundred dollars\nA new cat should new card issued and marketing costs when they\nAllocate it out to one new person\nSo you being loyal for so long they end up doing very well with you versus people card hop so if you want to make sure that you're doing it the safest way possible\nGo to the actual website or whoever the card company is and do your application through that instead of in response to any\nEmail or anything like that kind of like when I talked about earlier with the scam with the tuition\nAnd and we've done that when we know we know the site where we want to go and so uh\nWe'll edible that that is okay to do you know my thing about giving your Social Security number out is only in a situation where\nIt makes sense and that would be a case where it makes sense because they have no other way to evaluate you to decide whether or not your credit worthy and they want to share your car\nOkay thank you very much sure\nI Hope you enjoy the new plastic\n[laughter] so [laughter] well they don't make any money off of us we we pay 'em off every month anyway\nBut don't tell them that [laughter]\nDo you with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Julie\nHi crack how're you doing I'm fine thank you how are you\nGood you have a question for me that I both welcome and dread at the same time\n[laughter] [laughter] yes yes yes I'm I'm a single mom and my Thirteen year old now means places I was given a code is almost six thousand dollars\n[laughter] and um that's really ... for me even though there is insurance and insurance will call me a little bit of it that covers only maybe about a thousand dollars but the rest of the other side I have to pay for and I cannot afford it\nSo I was wondering if it was any sort of program that um you know low income families could get racing done on a sliding scale said the dairy scale or even for free I'm also I'm\nOkay so I'm not aware of any reduced rate programs based on income to get braces but I'm about to step into something that whenever I mentioned that I'm asking for trouble but I'm going to mention the way I'm about to tell you something that orthodontist hate\n[laughter] and think that it is a danger that it's creating a menace for your Thirteen year old but there are now a number of organizations that sell braces over the Internet\nOh\nAnd they send you a mold that you take an impression of your Thirteen year olds T the mold kids tend to be like eighty two hundred or so dollars and so you take the impression\nAnd then they based on the impression make 'em make these um retain ers\nFor you that ah the your child would wear that these things that people are buying online ... cost tends to be depending on who you go with a\nThousand to two thousand dollars so I mean that's a huge reduction and cost\nAnd I am obviously not I'm an orthodontist and all I can tell you is that the orthodontist think this is a horrifically\nAwful terrible dangerous idea but people are doing it more and more\nOh I see okay so\nI I'm just want to introduce that what you make your own decision tell you that I Am I'm qualified to hell you if that's a good choice or not um I have you know both of my daughters went through braces they went to the traditional way to an orthodontist\nIt was the fortune you talked about to have a Thirteen year old son seems to be fortunate enough to have ... feet that\nAre really really straight and hopefully we'll stay so and not need braces but this is the alternative\nThat again I have no personal experience with I didn't do it to my kids but if you were to go on Google or whatever search engine you use and do 'em\nA search like a self\nSelf install braces or something like that you'll find there are\nA bunch of these companies selling these now\nOh wow okay [laughter] [noise] well um that's interesting to know I had never heard of that but I can go Google and just get the EMT though\nUm and make a decision if it's anything you want to get involved in a search that search terms that in order to braces at home see if that works and you'll find info looking right now\nRaces at home see if that works then you'll find\nAnd file working right now\nOh my goodness there are a lot of these companies oh well that are selling the self install again I Can't tell you if it's a good idea because I'm not a medical professional you know we tell you it exists\nAnd if I Do go with it I Will let you all know\nPlays I Love the feedback you know one other idea that may work is a lot of dental schools will actually provide and lower cost is a way to teach or the ... to their students you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home
