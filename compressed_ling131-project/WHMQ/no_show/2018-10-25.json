Nineteen eighties Nineteen eighty seven signed by the ... than the leader of the Soviet Union hey countries that still existed\nAnd Ronald Reagan president of the United states it was the abolish men of a complete class of missile never done before\nThese were missiles that were intermediate range from a few hundred kilometers to several thousand kilometers and the concern was based in New York based in Russia that there was no warning\nThat when they were fired maybe six minutes maybe four minutes to target\nUnlike the ballistic missiles of\nUs and Russia in silos that have a big ballistic ark and you have some warning time there's none with the INS so what that means is\nWhen the missiles were fired miscalculation or not you must respond instantly don't check shoot launch on warning that is what\nStarted the end of the Soviet us Cold War in Nineteen eighty seven when the two scientists in these last hour as the president of the United states has acknowledged that the U.S will leave the INS treaty between us and Russia\nIn six months time unless\nThere is satisfaction that the Russians formerly the Soviets are not violating the INS treaty by building a new class of missiles intermediate range missiles\nTo replace the Soviet era ss twenties\nThese are ... on a great big truck that you can haul into the forest the tiger shoot from anywhere\nAnd again there's no warning they just come there like cruise missiles they fly right through and destroy either operations or leadership or other missiles before they can shoot back we welcome Rick Fisher\nOf the international assessment of strategy center writing most recently the epoch times about the INS treaty and China Rick I'm very good evening to you does China the tea LA\nDoes it have intermediate missiles that are comparable to the ss twenty of the twentieth century good evening to you\nJohn indeed China does have intermediate range ballistic missiles thousand fourteen it revealed its dong facing the F twenty six a four thousand kilometer range\nOr intermediate range ballistic missile comparable to the old Soviet ss twenty I R B um that was the subject and was destroyed because of the IMF treaty\nChina does have this missile in both the armed with nuclear warheads and with the new verbal anti ship ballistic missile warheads Gordon\nRick there a couple of problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight and the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance\nThat would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty because we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not a part of the treaty and the question is\nDo you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a new uh ins treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion that are both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nUh since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties when we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese is is is that they have refused entirely\nTo be constrained in any way by an international arms control treaty or they ... their goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide\nYou refused any kind of transparency so that your enemy or can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand this and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nJob does Russia\nHave a dialogue with China about intermediate range missiles say the same concern could be a magic in Russia had with Europe Russia could have with China there is no warning here\nJohn it's my opinion a based on conversations that there is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially the buildup\nOf ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however a lot of them are potent has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive\nSo he is going to downplay and ignore\nThe strategic challenge from China for now but I also believe that ... ... in his national security advisers understand that after this period of on talks with China that the Chinese are going to come after them and so they ... they were buying time to prepare\nFor an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians garden\nSo Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles that the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground\nThe U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable because they can be taken out on a first strike um do you think that the United states\nOnes that are in silos they're really vulnerable um because they can be taken out on a first strike\nUm do you think that the United states will actually go to what the Russians and the Chinese have which are these are a ballistic missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with the silos or in the future\nGordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nOr the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range

P. H. D. that divides all economies into their consumption their investment\nInstead of China has inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there's a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the place you work in support of his death so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that destruction\nGarden Charles uh you know the number of countries have tried to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems and and China certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nI I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation and history that we have in the west they just haven't lived through the many booms and busts than we can trace our modern economy\nBack to the mid Eighteen hundreds\nWe've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of the\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China assuming that they can sell their products and services and dumped them around the world places like the U. S. where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to cut your fascinate you have to encourage people consume more pleasure country\nAnd you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much did you truly have and if it's too much just go to the guy off the mark downs and there has to be a redo of a Chinese financial structure\nUh Gordon are reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense are they are they selling domestically\nI don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national barest artistic says retail sales increased nine point two percent in September the same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm nickel sales were down the three months of all three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that the consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slapped or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere would be panic if there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch I don't think they can do it this time um and we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child's uh what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eight here we're looking at just this come our way we got defenses for their equity collapse\nWell I think fortunately yes we do I mean\nThat's an eight year we're looking at just this come our way we got defenses for their equity collapse\nWell I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing is the chairman Jay Powell to the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent of the ten year which means that in awe of China collapsed or China downdraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all\nMuch better position than any other large economy it'll hurt is trying to go through this painful process economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population the mystic poses an order is certainly a very dangerous set of months here\nUm but in the end I think the United states\nEven if the Republicans do not maintain control that will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major\nCountry and and Gordon I'm checking with you all kinds of asked this question before is the Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures than they are they they they've they've missed price therapy ... can they take a hit\nI think that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been fighting the economy were too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago\nChina did not go through it's two thousand they everybody else did\nAnd eventually they've got to go through that I'm right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have moved to a move them down again and we're very I think robust period so um you know whether China goes up or down you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market collapsed their assets of collapsed in the central government is looking to subsidize that collapse as long as it can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that's like Fannie Mae times a million correct that war that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China the Asian and parts of Asia people do like the gambling lever and do it with ... money is very dangerous\nUm I Hope that our European banks which are also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China tried to best were the American banks or think we're pretty good shape but in a China collapse I think banks like torture bank and other European back to the blood heavily emerging markets in China wow are\nThey in trouble and garden of your talk about had banks putting in defense is here so that we don't go through a weight as as as the wave washes are way\nI Wish they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction and John but you know clearly there is going to be of some sort of adjustment and China probably will be severe I think there will be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that\nBut it will come because China has just done too much to balance its economy since two thousand that\nCharles hotel a Sunday slip Charles Gordon Chang's the Daily

tax structure Danny I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing yeah there are people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European it's a good question I think Europe\nIs ... around the place you know you have so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one culture wise they don't always things descended don't agree and taxation that they come from different countries with different rules it makes it very ...\nMore culture wise they don't always seem to seem to don't agree\nAnd taxation that they come from different countries with different rules and mix it very hard for the call invest\nGo invest meaning I Will instead of going to a fund I Will come to another family that took the ... states and I don't do that and that will join them in the roost investment and they will join me what I'm good at let's say to college and then we take the middleman out and it's just us and we have the same object is\nSo in Europe I think it's way more problematic because of what I've just mentioned well the U.S these huge and people came from the same place so convincing his way easier here than there so that's one of the major differences between the U.S and Europe\nWe had a crisis ten years ago the financial crisis it swept the earth uh cheaply it real estate failure in the United states to all of that laws were changed uh and I'm thinking chiefly of Dodd Frank and other adjustments in our tax system does that make it more ...\nOr ... or more likely for a family office to profit here or less likely\nI think even more I think because look it's it's it's it's the truth interface is what happened right you had the crisis which proved to you that the the the those are just supposed to guard you and care about you don't really do that or do to some extent\nYou had made all you had a lot of made off by the way it made it for one story the many stories or what people trusted people and they got you know a damaged by it very seriously\nSo I think that just drove them even more so to convince to say you don't forget about these guys are just your family I'm somebody we trust one another we look at each other in the eye by the way that actually what they do\nThey want us to trust I won't sit for the family office guy that told me\nI you know many tried in somebody else's thing to do a like a um an online investment vehicles and all that and try to make you know organizations like me networks make money out of it that lived in big business together and let's call it a commission of summer the ... you know it's ... wherever that is legal\nAnd it's never worked for nobody because I don't know if somebody else's wants to ... each other in the eye and that's important because that's a lot of

wall Street Journal who's a member of the editorial board and he's taking us into the eleventh district and showing us how the Democratic party is making a case that the tax cuts\nAnd jobs active twenty Seventeen which was a predicates along with the regulations for the boom and the economy these last month in court or is it was actually a tax hike I think that's right it's not quite logical but I built kind of helped me bill\nHow does the Democratic candidates Mikey Cheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she says but as a tax cut was a tax hike how does it work good evening to you about well\nIt works this way John or as you know that one of the more controversial aspects of the tax cuts was to a cap\nThe deductions for state local taxes and mortgages right and uh I Am a long suffering taxpayer of New Jersey Stan\nI'm but I was willing to give up these things for an overall cleaner system which they've done so by focusing on this I mean it's true that some taxpayers um\nBecause they're deductions on this will be kept a we'll have to pay more but there's also you know the AMC has been pared back and so forth and others standard induction has been raised so most people are getting a tax cut and even the people who fear\nThat they're not I mean we'll have to see in April but I think more it's going to a more is going to be a wash but it's it's a crazy argument I mean she's essentially arguing the tax bill um was it was a tax hike\nAnd you know the ways and means you can argue the figures old time but they have figure saying that for the average Morris county or or congressional district member Lebanon New Jersey the average family of four is going to get a six thousand dollar tax break\nThis is a problem the Democrats look to solve these last month since the tax cut in jobs that are to explain away the booming economy even to take credit for it I guess and uh build the general conventional wisdom is that they have been successful is that accurate in New Jersey\nWell I think I think someone in New Jersey look on the Republican running Jay Webber is is the real thing he's a principled a Republican and one of the few with the guts to embrace the tax cuts you know he says look be he would like to roll back some of the salt caps as well\nBut the overall it's been a big benefit the reason the Democrats get away with it in New Jersey and particularly the eleventh\nIs that Mike ... is a very attractive candidate and a by that I mean also has a um an attractive backstory she's a Naval Academy graduate I Believe a former helicopter pilot in the navy and worked for a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record\nRight and it's just absurd to complain about the capping the salt packs\nFor tax relief when you say nothing about the high New Jersey taxes the Democrats given us I mean since June June they've raised taxes and what's already one of the most over tax safe they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes\nThey've raised taxes and what's already one of the most over tax states they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes just since June and it's going to get worse so um you know it's not a coincidence that I'm Michelle says nothing\nAbout the tax hikes that her fellow Democrats loved to impose on um the poor residents of New Jersey stand like me\nFor those who do not live in the east coast New Jersey is part of the trifecta of blue states with an enormously high tax demand and that is why the salt fat is the state and local tax\nNon deduction in the tax cut in JOBS Act is such an argument here because one one hand you have all Democrats and on the other hand the well to do Democrats\nNow have can no longer to duck their ... their property taxes as they could before and that limits the ability of the Democratic governors to raise taxes that's what\nThat's that's a Frank Murphy in New Jersey Andrew Cuomo in New York certainly no bill that that solves deduction going away means that they have a harder time just routinely raising taxes\nYeah and uh it's actually it's going to force them to pay a price for it it's just all so we don't have a press that asked a lot of questions so again or make you Cheryl is running on a very attractive resume suburban mom good\nGood background in the military it's harder for her image or she runs very good ads I think her image is just hard to associate with ... the style Democrats and she says she wouldn't vote for pollute the as speaker but really do you believe that if she's elected that she's going to be a voice\nFor a tax reform and lower taxes in Washington I mean she's going to be voting with the rest of her party\nIs she is the party even miss it flows he says that our first priority and she's going to be the speaker if the Democrat I get it right or her first\nPriorities rolling back the tax bill I mean um it's just crazy we we are\nWithout doubt New Jersey the dumbest voters I mean we've all these professionals who who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so badly run so monstrous we over taxed and this is one reason why\nRolling back the tax bill before rolling back that Kavanaugh and Donald Trump yes there is a priority\nNow I don't think that Brett Kavanaugh is in her belly where but I think she'd like to do just shy of\n... I ... them and then does raise affect the Weber shall race in any fashion cars I see an end as is struggling to make a case here\n[noise] yeah I'm not sure in the debate um uh Jay Webber\nYou know I asked her whether she would vote for ... and she said she would and called them a fighter for New Jersey\nI'm not sure that helps her but I I think the truth is in New Jersey eleventh just no one wants to ask tough questions like what it really means for the state um would it really means for our economy and uh whether I'm whether we're going to get lower taxes as as a\nSort of implied if we vote for him Mikey Cheryl I it's it's just preposterous\nThe conventional wisdom says that the Democrats have between twenty and thirty feet to win here at the Y. and forty feet to win in order to take the majority and the Charlie Cook report says that thirty is a good number\nIs is the ... district credit culture that Thirty years this was always going to be a democratic way\nI'm not sure it was always going to be a democratic win but it it fits the profile to swing suburban district it's been represented by Rodney ... house and a moderate Republican\nWho has been a free\nRide who retired so it fits the profile that way um there's been a freelancer housing in Congress almost since there's been a Congress um so it fits the profile of retiring Republican members also the state's been growing blue or\nYou know I mean even before Donald Trump\nUm New Jersey is becoming a much bluer so ah I I'm not sure this just happened to be the year I mean Jay Webber to me is a very attractive candidate he understands economics he's been a strong voice in the state assembly a but again he has votes to defend than his opponent doesn't she's just running on a [noise]\nA some attractive ads

of Iran the same thing there's zero anti Israel sentiments a in Azerbaijan I visit there frequently I'd see\n... you know probably the Jewish person I feel more welcome a in Azerbaijan than I Do in

credit\nTo ah their Secret Service detail or would presumably they go through packages that the Clintons received my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detailed does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and again it's not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they just weren't opened apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering too they know not open and but I just\nYou know just out there what made these other people say you know high this package just suspicious they just didn't\nFeel right to look right now ... you know somebody's you know what what's out there that made them think that way but\nUh that's my comment and I'm just enjoy your show and I keep up the good work\nWell you're very ... thank you very much and I must say that you make a very intelligent comments there indeed uh what stood out about these packages a good question uh is certainly if you get a heavy packaging a pipe bomb has a heavy package\nOr right off the bat you tend to think was that something I ordered\nA that could cause I don't tend to get

group of people who just will not let this go they hate our president so much and they think I have to and that's the only one who's on his stomach\nWell all I can say is that uh that while I certainly have seen a lack of condemnation of such activities I have yet to see any linkage between the antifa groups and be quote Clinton machine\nNor have I seen any linkage between this bombing

subtitled the thrills chills screams and occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue you want I should have learned that in your lead off with this quote major fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled\nUnquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you [laughter] so\nWe're right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo ah what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approached my audience from a posture of humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as a full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that court credibility that our audience can feel\nAnd touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the the track is I certainly have been you can\nAnd do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and they don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I'd only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you I\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of it major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate\nAnd why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters\nHis press conference before the rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here\nYou're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic\nThat's Trump I should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually made and the sense as I say in the book\nOf al ... exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAt your table exuberance\nAll the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of\nThese great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time\nBeen more curious about this\nDifferent kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I'd I've learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so\nLong as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets yeah let's face it this\nWas an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for an eye on them up I mean let let's let's just your look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor had different\nCompletely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game\nI write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those\nParents who want to um school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book and Jack Black topples all that in the movies\nBe as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book and Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why don't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lights and you know that sort of thing and it took me

major Garrett is our guest his new book Mr Trump's wild ride is as good a first draft of history as I've read about this presidency a pat recalls and from Lincoln the Ozarks Missouri tonight give good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nHow come I Want to thank thank a major Garrett for writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth but I really think if anybody takes a look at these bombings it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received a bomb\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating them and it's running around trying to find out who set these bombs I think and this happens right before the election closet take the heat off the convoy coming up through Mexico\nOh I well let's let our guests comment about to all of those various factors that has momentarily are taking the attention away from that the caravan but I can assure you that the care of and once it gets close to the U.S border we'll be right back front and center and and\nTry to gauge it at the gym I think the I was up in the long run and we've got the same time I think you can continue and it was doing go ahead\nSure and and the caravans going to remain a story and remember it's if it remains on its current course is soccer arrive if it ever does at the U.S border for weeks after the election there are a long long way away but the government's going to be a story it it that's not going away and the FBI has lots of different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things\nOn a day to day in our our basis and yes it's a high priority case but the people who work at work those kinds of cases they don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes and one's in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work\nBut what I think the caller is already indicate Jim ... is a sense of\nWhat is this really about and I would I Would caution everyone in the audience and I say this all the time and we we\nHave a an approach

Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince and now that we of course have some later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that I Hope listeners gained from our conversation demos is that the answer this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in the sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made\nWhat if you want to call them listen to White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen they're likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump through the good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition to start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach to that kingdom\nIn that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and I detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational to this emerging\nRio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and a long time ago summer of last year\nWhen the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book\nYou don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about anytime many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is I I recommend the book to you because you can actually find out in Jared Kushner's words what they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were\nThen they'll click came to our class and talked about being a positive bystander so I realize there are some ways I can

that's how they way it is by the pound which is just crazy when you think about how small these pills are must be something that's like you might not forget you never know what people are going to

we get all kinds of different things dropped off\nBut these are people do miss use these things and and a lot of it as friends and family and I can remember years ago there was one thing I had to your stomach disorder\nAnd my former mother in law a pointed to something in the medicine cabinet okay you know take one of those you'll be fine right I started hallucinating and I saw a parrot an honest to God parrot flew in the window and spoke to me I don't make this stuff up to the nation so there's all kinds of stuff that the all you take one of these no problem it's a lot of that going around\nIf you have extras and you throw it in the cabinet and think oh maybe I'll need that some day or if it's expired and you don't know what to do with it they can actually be misused you know I think if there's a child that has a headache and thinks they're taking Tylenol and they're taking something like that and they're starting to see parents and we we don't want that but also your parents\nWith the opioid epidemic we're dealing with right now we also know folks will are breaking into houses looking for ... you know because a lot of these\nOpioids are prescribed and people do

know for something that was prescribed to something that was legally in the home exactly yeah but they were experimenting with it or playing with it or stolen from the grandmas medicine cabinet and

objective here is to raise awareness and the elderly are a little bit vulnerable here ...\nWe find some folks their prescriptions just add up and up and up or they change\nAnd so then maybe got more pills in the medicine cabinet then you need one concern is folks a little older dealing with different kinds of problems may accidentally take the wrong pill ... and so if there's some there that you know you're not going to need any more than the smart thing to do is just get them out of the house and not have to worry about 'em\nRight and and of course as you say what we used to do just thrown down the toilet describe what why this is important not to do that you care\nWell believe it or not it'll end up in the water system is is what we've learned and maybe not directly immediately but as they drain out and they really can affect though the wildlife as well as our own drinking water systems and\nYou know these are serious drugs and that is not something you want to mix\nIn the rivers and streams you know for the fish and wildlife but also if it does ever end up in our drinking water it could be a problem get 'em all incinerated and it's quite a process but it's a worthwhile to make sure they're being taken care of properly is that what a sight to behold who we have the permanent drug boxes so we're making trips down there every month ...\nBut on the drug take back day when we've got a huge load all at once and then it might the sight to see all these boxes going up\nYour privilege to a lot of things that the regular citizen can't even imagine\nThe wild one is the gun

if I was there catcher I'd be nervous and get on the trading Black Friday but they're also in the world series so they're not doing too bad\nThat at a different the arc I mean the red Sox have been riding high the whole time with the Dodgers sort of got you know hot late\nAnd that's another thing we kind of went into the Yankees Astros series kind of as the underdog even though we had a hundred and eight wins the expectation against those hard hitting clubs\nAnd now we're kind of the favorite against the Dodgers with a hundred and ... but it's all going to come down to pitch and you know Christian Bale does he didn't follow through like I think he will and then David Price which they are priced shows up tomorrow is a\nI don't know I think David prices gotten over something here I

while since they got David Price or he was supposed to be the ace of all ages he's never been to ... the staff suddenly now in this postseason he's become the face and I think\nThere might do a little bit of J. D. drew in that somebody that people who are\nThe you know criticized for the size of contract and that he wasn't to delivering on maybe drew in two thousand seven had that huge grand slam ... that that put them into the world series um and had a strong postseason there you know\nPeople were member J.

David Price took his time as he walked off the Fenway Park around in the sixth inning as the crowd roared approval behind a Red Sox dug it appears to be enjoying himself all that does snafu last year with Dennis Eckersley I guess that's the thing is a pass on\nIt is yeah it it is and and I think if you ask him about it too I think I think you feel like you could have handled that whole thing differently or the than he did but it's in the rearview mirror now and and even through that Steve Price has always been somebody this team mates have like you know if you have to have\nHave felt like the Dave Price was supporting them and the younger players and things that you had had\nBeen there corners of the ... think stupidly ... question about it just it was dumb about but he was attempting

defend a teammate just doing it kind of a weird guy to lead\nThe controversy part of this whole thing is before the game or they had to several members of the uh championships teams of two thousand for two thousand seven throughout the first pitch and Curt shilling was not invited by the red Sox are all about is that because it is a right wing leaning ways or something or what's going on\nI ... that is what everyone's assuming and I'm and I am included in everyone [laughter] it's\nA and no secret I mean on the radio saying listen to it ... that I you know I'm I'm pretty left uh I'm pretty left wing as far as as far as\nMy own that's the only reason you're on the show that sort of\nHurts dealing with a huge part of that that is\nOr is it does I Would have been ... years is that the red Sox have not said what their motivations buzz on any of it and it's worth noting to before the postseason in two thousand sixteen this is after showing had been fired 'em before the postseason two thousand six in ... they had the two thousand four team back\nTo do some kind of first pitch ceremony as well\nDo you invite chilling ... at that point so there's ... they have invited him before so I don't know what all the deal is behind the scenes I don't know um\nYou know I I don't know all of the details in the intricacies of this relationship so it is it something else happened that that it's not public I'm not sure I have no idea with it but it's not like the red Sox have has cut him off ... says he's done\nSome of the snake ... it it's I'm not I'm not very highly positive I Wish they would just I mean you're going to do is to say something more specific because I think that people are left a lot of room for\nA [laughter] a little bit by the way when I used to coach a youth ball Ari I used to use ... as a model and I said are showing this pitching tonight I Want everybody all my pictures I Want you to make sure to watch him when he had the greatest form I mean and it's kind of an old fashioned type over the top form the had but uh like Tom ... are off to\nPick him he was on he was an absolute course yes as well in a big game and in\nIn my lifetime and a big game there isn't it wasn't a whole lot of pictures that you'd want more and Curt Schilling guy from kind of in his diamond back in late and it's still his career is diamond backs career and his Red Sox career that that wasn't somebody you'd want more he was he was even when the when the pressure was on and\nAmazing so now ... along with the other uh sports writers that cover the red Sox you now on your way

spectacular\nYeah I think prices really redeem themselves in the eyes of many Red Sox fan and\nI also think that the way in which the Boston relief corps has come through and starting pitchers as relief pitchers remarkable managerial move I think Alex score\nOut score on to something out of date Robert Mac is making a lot of mistakes like he's doing the whole I'm going to bring in a left handed pitcher to face this left handed batter which makes it a lot of sense from a traditional standpoint it's not working plus LA seems to be swinging for the fences\nAlso not working Alex Cora bringing in the starters in middle relief lane a lot of small ball that is really you know and there was much valley who about\nHow many runs the Sox scored with two outs over the course of the series is and and that's exactly right\nThey've scored something like eighty percent of their runs with two outs in in ... yeah that doesn't have obviously it does happen it can happen happen with some good

counsel Brian Stevenson and I drove south from Atlanta\nThirty five miles to the Georgia diagnose diagnostic um classification center\nMaximum security prison surrounded by rolling hills and manicured lawns\nThis is where in Georgia execute inmates and then go on and they talk about how Brian in this book is the second piece is titled hearing Brian Stevenson and there are two things are Brian said that it's just stayed with me this is\nA ... has never been able and don't want to get them out of my mind\nBut he said he's talking about\nPoverty and he said the opposite of poverty is not rich is the opposite of poverty is justice and I think is really very very profound and\nWhat he said and the second pieces about this the talks that he gave the ACLU annual dinner in Boston and he talked about just what you were talking about which is\nNot only the death penalty but the death penalty of being sentenced to life in prison that any possibility of ever being released which is the type of dissent to death\nIn prison and he concluded that speech by saying look the\nFight goes on it goes on forever in different forms as you just pointed out in the exhibit at the museum\nShows and he says look the old phrases eyes on the prize hold on because that's what we'll keep us going Brian Stevenson also as I should point out and I do say this in the book um\nThe warmest\nMost beautiful talented intelligent amazing human being I've ever met and it was an honor to get the death penalty case with him and his bus Eisenberg that what what was the outcome of that case\nWe litigated for eight years we went to the as for you at the Supreme Court twice they rejected us twice\nWe were in many states courts and federal federal district court we succeeded in having the death sentence overturned\nBut the judge did not overturn the underlying conviction giving us in a very difficult situation of did we want to appeal or not\nBecause if you appeal if we appealed we'd put that victory now his life and life with the possibility of parole that's no longer\nA ... an option but at the time\nWas life with the possibility of parole that would be his sense or we should go forward and try to overturn the conviction itself but then we put in jeopardy the victory we had on the sentence and so we did not appeal the state did not appeal interestingly enough\nAnd so the outcome of the case was the death penalty was reversed and he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole um wow I'm Ron we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with reading\nThe rise and rabbi just living

you've got a question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer that question\nCould they may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security at a sixty two and possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount at a later age I feel like with the right investment you probably wouldn't be doing better off than waiting\nTill a sixty six and four months so it seems like an old chunk of change\nYour life and the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nThis done or is it what investments earned today what savings earn today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the putative advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment as a space for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age sixty to\nWrite my advice is when you've got to have the money is when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take it where you know eight\nEight Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to ah hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it so you gave the ah you gave the analogy\nOf sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nI plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm Still feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so\nProbably good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to live in years to regain the money that I let go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um\nYears is later and retirement when we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work\n... years is later and retirement when we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefit now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know that we are not a genetically disposed to live long those guys in my family so it can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nIt's over Ninety eight inches still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there's a direct advantage to waiting because what you're really concerned about his way down the road\nSo I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited 'til age Seventy that he ends up moving a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money\nNoble is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nThis fiber talk to you than well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you had a nasty gram from a credit card company where did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or as a ... and those are not uh I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars nothing to do or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by December wells that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if\nIt would be in my best interests I guess in my credits best interest I close the cart\nBefore then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere's no real advantage to you having that if you have you have sufficient credit elsewhere visas MasterCard as American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nBecause I ... I Would dump it just how I Am just let them kicking the curb in December and be done with them because\nThere's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending\nTo use it again so let's just walk away\nOkay it it did as a either a MasterCard logo or because\nYou're not going to then I'd want you to keep it I'm not sure go keep it do some purchase somewhere or whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card poker then it stays\nAs active in part of your overall credit mix but when it's just\nA ...

save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from a four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans\nBut the thing is when you do that those loans dramatically reduce how much money you have down the road\nWhen in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings from

uh evidently\nIn the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust in that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOkay how would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product or service is being sold\nIf it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use

about with our mortgages are like the other than I inherited a two family house in the Boston area completely paid off I think I've had paid it off for maybe ten years ago at least\nWere entertaining the idea of the very fact mortgage at hired by the time and clean and we get one at your opinion on that\nThat is a fascinating scenario that no one has ever asked me so I entirely a reverse mortgage the eligibility begins\nAt age sixty two are sixty five or thank you and your brother in that category yet\nNo he he'll be sixty two hundred thousand seven years but I only be fifty five\nOkay so you've got some time before this is a potential viable option right but under under the lending\nFive okay so you've got some time before this is a potential viable option might but under under the lending guidelines having a duplex where you have ten minutes on one side\nAnd the two of you and the other or do you each take one side of the duplex\nNow he lives in a a downstairs apartment I Lived in the Afghans oh there's no a turn right at all\nSo I Would I Would suspect and again it would depend on the lending guidelines that would be in effect a seven years from now that may work\nAnd the thing though with the reverse mortgages is that I always look at them as a last option not middle one or a first one\nAnd the reason is and again this is under today's rules the feeling that you and your brother would have to pay our gigantic to originate or reverse mortgage the fees are astronomical compared to a traditional alone\nSo it is an option that you look at when you have a lack of other options to provide income that each of you would need to live\nMonthly right so ...\n... it's too soon in your life spans to be looking at this and you know it's going to completely depend on how the rules play out and you and your brother under today's rules we both have to go to financial counseling\nUh-huh to make sure that this is an appropriate stepping strategy for you and then you'd be able if the rules again permit to take out the reverse mortgage which essentially sends you a check every month instead of the more mortgage company receiving a check from you each month\nRight okay so the principal source for the loans is through the federal government mhm\nSo they have their underwriting standards and guidelines that determine whether or not you would qualify again at that time what is it that's making you and your brother think of a reverse mortgage and appointed a you're pretty far from normal retirement age\n[noise] um well wouldn't be the one that I have children and when we don't have spouses and I'm going to be honest with you I'd rather enjoying life before I you know I'm living in tents and they don't want to travel now I don't want to wait until I'm In my seventies you know what I mean and just really into\nRight there and I'll tell you the alternative is to do a home equity line of credit\nOkay\nHome equity line of credit would be much cheaper to set up and we'd have more flexibility you don't have to worry about the federal rules or you can do that now you don't have to wait\nTill uh he's sixty two\nAnd you would have to service the interest on it for typically a ten year period and then after ten years that's when principle that you would have borrowed would have to start being paid back but it's much more efficient way to access money\nThan to do so through a reverse mortgage\nRight I mean it's not something we're thinking about her you know like I said I hadn't eighty seven to ten years okay within that timeframe yeah\nYeah so again at that time depending on your financial circumstances it still might be a better idea to do a home equity line of credit than it would be to do a reverse mortgage\nTravis with us on the

money each and every month\nJeremy is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jeremy\nHigh court thanks for taking my question well I'm Glad to do so you want to talk credit cards\nI knew so my question actually a pertains to uh we use credit cards is a a payment system especially ones that give us good cash back towards that are on rotating category and a\nWhile you have more license than I Do I got to tell you a Jeremy I can't my brain cannot process rotating categories of rewards\n[laughter] it's getting used to and I will say that I I think you're up for it could end up back in the wall and cards I call them couch cards 'cause we use this one card a long time ago to buy a couch and all day [laughter] so I got her I got an offer in the mail for ten per se cash back for a certain category so I I definitely jumped on that but\nMy question is is all these nice cars that use these categories are so my wife is kind of being and I'm the yang and I'm online payments here and so she's in the apple spirit says she would be using potentially apple pay a and I would be the Android paid so the more frugal side there\nAnd my question is when you use alternative payment processors a navy those payments for those charges are not going to be reflected as the correct category and so my question is is is if you the apple pay your Android Pay\nWhen those charges go through or are they gonna show up at the apple pay your Android Pay are they going to show up at say a grocery chain where I get a certain amount of\nThey'll show up at the chain see with ... with apple pay an Android Pay what they both do is they create\nThe chain where I get a certain amount of Kenya they'll show up at the chain see with ... with apple pay an Android Pay what they both do is they create\nA safer payment environment\nBecause they're using far more sophisticated technology to transmit a payment than what the banks use\nWith their credit cards so it's more secure platform\nWhen she pays with apple paying you pay with Android Pay and all it is is uh is the trans its way the payment information is transmitted to the store you're paying so it should have zero effect\nOn you getting those reward bonuses and the rotating categories\nOkay great and you would know that\nIf there was any problem you'd know that right away\nBecause they were first statement would show that and you and\nUh you probably have to call customer know service and get it credited to the right category but I I've never heard of anybody having a problem where it did not properly migrate to the right category using\nA Samsung Pay apple pay Android Pay or who knows who else is pay\nOkay well great that answered my question then\nI have a great day Andrea is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrea how're you doing today\n[laughter] I'm good I'm such a big fan thanks for taking my call off\nSure was great to have you here you have something that isn't as great as you like you have student loans to deal with\nI hear the hiring fell down here at my ears like inside and out of well what can you hear ... just getting around theory finance bang currently I Am part time but I have a plan of all time\nBecause that might encounter that ratio and you know currently with my part time and time again you need a whole diner on mail out on\nSo I was wondering what your thoughts are should I wait for bell for trying to start re financing for my income to get ratio is not what it is now or should I take out\nYou know 'cause I I had asked my parents if they would be willing to fight and then and they are asking about like a temporary life insurance plan if I were\nNot expecting a crowd like if\nI can talk about it [noise] they don't want to be easy to them if you depart mayor half that stuff is\nJust wandering quite thought all\nRight so let's go back a step Andrea your loans that you have that you've had a since he got out two years ago where they federal or private\nPlane federal um I had about ... uh Eighteen thousand pry that\nAre and how much total in federal would you guess\nOkay don't cranes too much but it's about Seventy eight\nOkay so that's actually good you want much more if not all federal and as little as possible private so the federal loans you don't want to co mingle with the private in any kind of re fi\nOkay so the federal loans tend to have decent interest rates you know because years would be a various rates what rates are on your various federal\nAnywhere from like three and a half for six point eight I think as high as\nOkay so the lower ones there's no way you'd want to look at re fine you don't need a\nCo signer for any of those the six ... six point eight by standards of recent years this was an undergraduate loans not graduate or the U.S\nOkay because the graduates are probably the ones that are six point eight but the thing with the federal is you can take your federal loans and have them under the direct federal program known as revised pay as you earn\nOkay and under that program they'll loan payment you're required to make is automatically adjust it up or down based on your income so the fact that you're working part time you may not have any obligation to make payments at all and still be considered to be current\nOkay so the federal loans you don't want to take them and migrate them to any kind of private refinance okay in addition with the federal loans what is it you do for a job what kind of field one\nI'm not a veterinarian\nOkay I don't know is veterinary medicine a field that gets you loan forgiveness after ten years\nI think of as\nOkay so otherwise it'd be twenty typically\nYou're under revised pays you earn like if your income or doesn't climb by a very large amount and you're paying is required under revised pays you earn your loan balances forgiven eventually on the federal\nOkay so that's why you don't want to co mingled those at all I see okay\nAnd by the way I Know this means you're an ultra brilliant person because it's much harder to get into veterinary medicine school than it is and their traditional medical school\nI don't know about the brilliant part [laughter]\nSo on the private loans what interest rates that they carry I\nNot sure if I could tell you that right off the path\nRight so until you get your arms around what kind of rates you have in terms on the private loans I wouldn't do anything moving forward with doing any kind of re fi or anything like that but the only loans you would want to consider refined are those private ones\nAnd maybe you do wait until you have\nThe full time gig as a veterinarian and then you don't have the income to support refine on your own without your parents then you don't have to get into that thing\nThat makes them uncomfortable\nOkay they even after I go full time should I tell the federal\nCompelling role loans on their own but again move them if they're not already move them into revised pay as you are\nOh cool okay alright best to you is about a guy thanks I might say everything you do sure by by Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show host Tom Hi Tom you want to talk about L.

series continues\nLet's start with the price on different ... and that's for sure [laughter] yeah oh I got to admit it's disturbing well I could the red light of disturbing to you I Try to be empathetic when I can thank you thank you thank you Monti but most of the time but for for a serious moment\nI Am concerned because I think the feeling\nAnd I know it's that difficult and dangerous to generalize but the feeling that the country is spinning out of control is something that feels very real to me\nThe divisiveness of the country since the election of Donald Trump that's that is real news and it is true but it's also not new\nBut the level of hatred and the extraordinary I think a than a phobia and hatred that Donald Trump is spewing it all his campaign stops\nProclaiming I'm a nationalist was all the implications that has for racism and militarism with the crowds going wild\nSaying yes we all of the great leader\nI find this disturbing and disturbing at a\nLevel and intensity and I really hadn't felt before and I suppose you could say okay there's one\nVery disturbed human being out there sending bombs are fake ... pipe bombs to national democratic leaders still that level of violence which Donald Trump says is terrific I understand he issued an official statement saying he was not in favor of pipe bombs but he's\nThe one who's revving all of the ... who says yes hatred is good racism is good at making fun of people with disabilities wage I mean and and he lives all the time\nAnd no one even thinks anything about it anymore he invents facts about middle Easterners being in the Caribbean and coming up from Mexico it's total fabrication\nBut he lives so much that the media doesn't even pay attention to it any more because it's impossible to keep up with and what is it we should pause it from the president of the United states lies so frequently\nThat the media no longer even bothers to comment on your bronco bomb allied twice\nIn the media news court headlines across the United states Donald Trump has spoken or written over five thousand bearable verifiable lives since he's been president United States\nAnd on the whole idea is that you have

really bad\nUh politics for ...\nOr starting with the fiscal control board though was named by President Obama Democrat\nSo we are being used as\nA up ... points as pawns in this political electoral a system\nIn the United states and that's the part that I think it's abused is\nTowards migrant community that needs a attention and the attention that we need is how do how to make things better for them so that they can actually freely issues where they want to be that they can be in their countries of origin and put ... in their neighborhoods\nAnd and develop a at at at dignified life there that is the problem I think\nDo you see any possibility that the families who've had to flee because of Hurricane Maria will sooner or later the physically able and financially able to return to the ...\nUnfortunately I have to say I don't think that will be a possibility in the\nShort term um I mean but don't you go was already in a in a bad shape before to the ... and right now we know that I'm older for economic uh I'm I'm\nIndicators actually worse now that they were before so\nThose that that left without employment will not find any uh\nUh in particular they go back ... schools are closing at an alarming level like we have pretty much ... kicking in\nThere's a problem with the police department does it does ah their problems um I mean some of you may know but but but the political police department is right now I'm On juggling um judicial process because of abuses civil rights abuses in Puerto Rico\nWe also have a health crisis as well um I mean after ... more than sixty percent of our of our hospitals are collapsed and ah we now know that many of ... of of those that died died not because of the humidity in itself\nBut because of a lack of access to hospitals do two clinics to food um so it it is a structural problem and it's with us and it will not go you know away over night so that's why I think is very difficult for people to come back\nWe'll let me conclude or what are some ... to promote by asking the flip side of the question which is for the people who have to remain here what kind of reception ever had and what was their wives you are going forward compared to what they would have been\nIf there had been able to say on the island\nOr by the families and friends and community organizations they happened to receive with open arms by the
