list has a column up about the contest between Ron dissent is the Republican Andrew Andrew Gillum the Democrats are getting from some very good questions about\nWho is Andrew Gillum and is the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is either about to move towards the Obama part of the Democratic party or are they going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical in that part of the Democratic party\nLiz can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election\n[laughter] that's a really good question Andrew Gillum that Democrat\nCandidate was a surprise winner in the primaries that were held I don't know when that was six weeks ago or so at no one really saw it coming he's the mayor of Tallahassee and\nA really there had not a whole lot was known about him he is an attractive African America and a good Baker is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say or or mold\nA but really no one knew a huge amount about this guy a ... including the fact that there was a corruption scandal swirling around Tallahassee where he is mayor uh to the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers\nA has been subpoenaed to appear a ... that they had he was um [noise] caught up Gillum to an FBI\nA investigation and where they ... it ... it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena\nBut he's pretty darn close to a lot of feeling bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I have no idea what the outcome that will be as I say he is not personally been mentioned\nBut it's very close to his office which I think is tainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this Florida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average\nUh and it just unimaginable of course from New York as I Do need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of the low tax\nRates there and the fact that it's a great place to die forgive me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly on a corporation is\nA but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros he is not at all and the Apollo lyrical low in fact his way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has gotten so much traction in this race\nLet's look at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing least successful in other races where the logic escapes me\nFor example where where did it just because of the economy will affect the frustration here uh for me to figure this out with political science the Republican Party has delivered three point five percent following four point two percent of GDP\nThat that is supposed to to to dominate the conversation but it's not instead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump is that the Democratic message is that is that the closing arguments Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I really love to hear it because I don't think it exists a instead what you have is anti Trump favor\nUm and and the problem is because the president is out there\nA ... presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests in a sense that Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now I think he's doing the right thing I think he does those turned out I think he is\nBonding to his presence in these races now I think he's doing the right thing I think he does those turned out I think he's out there were lining voters had voted for him you know our work is not done what\nObama did that in twenty ... do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly one don't give him the keys back they grand the car into the debt don't give him the kid back\nAnd he ... he was extremely popular and the ... came back okay fine so and so but I don't remember making Obama the centerpiece of twenty ten that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and healthcare that ... ten\nAnd twenty fourteen where the Republicans held up white firmly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although it was his administration the puzzle here is what is the Democrats promised to do\nIn this closing argument against all they've promised to do is remove Donald Trump that's the that's the campaign promise\nWell actually as you know it's how dire a wealthy Democrat backer has put a lot of money at this rate for candidates who promise\nTo pursue impeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to impeach the president a Maxine Waters is going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the\nOpportunity to subpoena records and financial transactions all kinds of stuff from the president's so she has promised to move to a an impeachment uh hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure they'll do that I think that that this\nThing a little bit child is new and I agree that Republicans should be out there talking about the growth of the economy right tax cuts the deregulation but the Republicans are doing it they are so cowed\nBy the damage ... Democrats particularly about the tax cuts how it was all going to the corporations and to the wealthy people that they're really intimidated and they and and maybe it's I Can't connect the dots I don't know but it's very disheartening that they have this weapon of the economy and they're not using it\nLive peek a columnist at Fox News columnist up the hill I'm John bachelor this segment of the global business report brought to you by the Republican ... from food energy to our knowledge economy the Republican ... the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring this is the John bachelor show\nDon't have them\nThat for the first time in decades the blue collar folks are gaining wages faster than the white collar folks and I think again\nThat has a lot to do with the supply side nature of this expansion where the corporate tax rate are dropping to Twenty one percent the small business rates dropping too about Nineteen percent\nUm that is paying off\nSo that blue collars people who own and operate their own companies and businesses\nAnd they are hiring and that's why the blue collars are doing the best they've done in many decades I think that's something that again many of my good friends on the other side of the aisle or they don't want to talk about it but you know what Henry Kissinger used to say\nAn argument is always better John when it has benefitted by the facts and at some point are critics will have to acknowledge the fact\nI Want to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time and what I'm told repeatedly these last weeks is a small business confidence has never been higher\nAnd these were the first people to endorse or embrace wrong a Donald Trump early in the campaign cycle and I've puzzled about it what did they know that every all the smart guys don't know\nThey're still very confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nAnd I think you know\nGoing back to the campaign a candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over\nAnd the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest or you will be rewarded rather than penalized that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nThe beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nSteve you have a question about business investment please\nI wanted to ask Larry about this because I was just at a at a conference today and it's on the campus of recording how a lot of the good news that letter was talking about some of the skeptics Larry and I I Love your kind of response to this\nWill say well gee you know there there were some really bad news in this latest report everything's safe because that way but that will get that for example that you know basically ... percent growth now\nThat they were saying they were very disappointed with the business aspect numbers and that shows that the corporate tax cut isn't working and so on and and I don't know if I handled that question very well but I you know what you'd say that\nWell you know I think there were some glitches and that number I'm which will probably show up in a much stronger number and the fourth quarter in my show up in subsequent revisions um for example uh in the court ... court business investment spending\nShipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent and orders were up eight point five percent both that ad rates now that doesn't really jive\nWith uh the slowdown in business equipment which was only zero point four percent and I think that which will be straightened out a in a in cue for if not sooner\nBut a key point here National Association that business economists nay\nThey are reporting a new record highs and profits and profit margins\nAnd I'm profits are the lifeblood of the economy and so I reckon as long as profits hold up and they are they may be having another shelf life here\nThat's gonna really pro pal investments spending business investment spending which also the prophet increases are are they to function of the a reduction in marginal tax rates\nLarry our our consumers are driving this that's the way it should be right we're ... the ...\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter only in this quarter jog or in the prior quarters it\nWas business investment in fact most of this expansion of the Trump expansion is coming from the business side uh although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at the statistics\nUm business investment fixed investment up six point\nFour percent over the past year a consumer spending up three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's the healthiest because\nWe have not seen this since the mid to late Nineteen nineties and you can have a true strong economic recovery such as we are experiencing if it's just consumer spending after all supply creates its own demand business investment\nCreate more capital per worker

this area of the sky for nine years at at the Scott it's basically looking for changes in the light coming from the stars its primary mission\nIs to see if those changes in life can be identified as

commercial rocket Bob what is rock\nRocket lab is an American company which is mostly based in New Zealand\nUm they ... they have had to launch attempt the second was successful they have a very small rocket called the electron rocket this is a photo is\nA company focused on launching small sets cube SATs baking image primary payloads and then she'll go have lunch almost once a week if not more than that and uh this third launch is tentatively scheduled for November eleventh\nAnd then that touting that launch as their first commercial operational launch\nAnd they already had a bunch of uh a cube SATs satellites payloads signed up for that launch while the news here is they signed up\nAnother company to put two satellites are payloads on that last so you're going to have those stupid these two satellites plus two other communications satellites plus\nAn educational cube SATs plus a drag cell technology demonstrator um and plus another uh what do you call it a optical satellite and now that is the last ... it's a small satellite she's all small keeps ...\nEven smaller that and they're sending for November eleventh launch this is it even though the calling operational still a test launch in a sense if that is accessible they're going to follow up with another a launch in December and if that successful I\nThink it's pretty likely that come twenty Nineteen this company who can be launching almost weekly would keep sets it can be pretty exciting\nOut from their New Zealand launch site or are they still talking about moving you\nKnow they they they're not going to move they talked to a week or so ago they announced that they're also going to launch in addition at some point out of wall of silence the middle and try a space sport that's in Virginia so what will happen eventually as they hope to be launching from both sites on a regular basis this\nMeans they can really get a lotta satellite allowed satellites off the ground to make some very valuable as a settled for satellite companies\nNow the mother ship of commercial success they tax uh confirming Boca Chico for the mysterious be as far as what is the fireball\nAre is he alive mosques vision of the next generation rocket the big falcon rocket and is the key\nTo this what this rocket his intending is it's going to put a lot of payload into orbit comparable to a Saturn five but that big goal with this rocket is it that we will be completely re usable\nThey thought they could maybe I'm a upgrade the falcon nine and the Falcon Heavy to be completely re usable because they don't use the stage but they've decided to be better to build from scratch with what they now know\nAnd the forest two stages of first stage which they know how to use that had to land that vertically the upper stages kind of like a\n... a shuttle using shuttle concepts as it comes back in the atmosphere it uses its body like the shuttle it to shed speed so that can slow down enough to land but I'm like the shuttle it's not going to land on a runway they're going to use what they already know how to do and that's particularly land it\nAnd what they announced this week is that they're going to do the first top a test of the bill fat big falcon rocket ... upper stage it's out of their new space for facility in Boca she cut Texas that's near Brownsville near the tip of a Texas day they've been developing that space sport very slowly\nUh they've now made it clear that they've gone to use it to those protests these protests have similar when they were doing when they're developing the first stage capabilities of landing with the falcon one\nTalking nine they were doing they were using something called grasshopper prototype to do those up and down test well this will be doing those tests with the upper stage of the bill for ... top Ken rocket [noise]\nUm it's a big deal and uh they hope to start these in late twenty Nineteen but don't be surprised if it gets delayed but it's going to be that it's going to be doing these tests and I'll bet some of those debts will include landing on a barge\nThirty seconds Bob Japan is launching for you a e as it's a money maker\nOh well this is the case with Japan and

this was a small cube set once again but it's a university style satellite to teach people how to build satellites they built it a Japan they signed a contract Japan to launch it and that's what's

me of rock Obama where\nHe and the early days of his career was so associated with anti American radicals anti Israel radicals on them runs for president on on a ... a centrist platform and it's the same here with him\nHe's made statements against moving the embassy of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem eyes when various ... statements about the Gaza Strip and claims that Israel was using rocketing from Gaza to justify attacks against the Palestinians\nAre and now we finally he go I'm training and the founder of dreamed offenders which boycott Israel and he's claiming on the other hand that he doesn't support the boycott of Israel and that is pro Israel\nHis giving speeches and synagogues or at least one synagogue wearing a yarmulke keep hot and talking about how much he loves Israel so a lot of questions about who is the real Andrew Gillum here is he the centrist or is he the founder which I found he is of this organization\nAaron Aaron how did you how did he how did this happen why wasn't he vetted why didn't he sanitize his background it does\nI Can't explain this I mean I'm reading some of these statements from their mission he worked on his cell twenty Seventeen he didn't win the nomination will twenty Eighteen but gee they have some time here he talks about community safety police brutality in prison abolition\nThey're working toward quote ending the car several they first time I've ever seen the word carnival in Maine [laughter] cars or the prison Davis in translation and challenging the priest opposition that our communities are made safer when our fellow human beings are locked in cages\nThis is nonsense Aaron and why didn't they wipe it out do art do they do they not care that sticks with him\nYou know I'm Wondering the exact same thing because the videos are still up there on the audio is there including a conference call we're going through right now about ... the promotion of black lives matter the Web are classes that are there so you know it could very well be that that Gillum used\nThe let's say the far left of the progressive movement in order to build his base and won the ... and win the primary\nAnd he's in a very strange position because he's taking money from them and they're all this group that we're describing here is on the ground now in Florida are trying to get out the vote so I don't think he can disavow them or even removed the activism given that he's not just took closely associated with them they formed the backbone of his campaign\nAnd this is nonsense this is just nonsense and there are people in Florida who are Democrats who run newspapers are they reading this nonsense are how do they have an explanation for this I mean I wasn't getting him if he was a young person but he's not\nYou know the media so far has until Ron dissent is made it into an issue they were staying away from it now it's it's becoming an issue and actually I'll tell you I'm I'm I've seen polio where independents here in Florida they care deeply about the corruption issue that's turning them off\nAnd then after corruption in the FBI issue is actually this is what I'm Talking about now which is dream defender so uh I think maybe he was relying on the media kind of shielding and in this cocoon of silence\nAnd it it was happening in the beginning but now it's not actually I'm the mainstream media publication of the Miami Herald a Tampa Tribune the others are actually on those\nAre ... and this has now become if ... it's a following him throughout the campaign trail um as high as the FBI and I notice actually Gillum in the last few days suddenly the darling of the media is actually dodging reporters for the first time in his candidacy\nAh the remarks about native tribes of their sovereignty ... more ... I won't read it but is there a radical faction of\nNative Americans and are working who are working for him I mean what is this not this is this the rhetoric of the progressive that doesn't have any connection to reality\nYou know I don't know that it's for Native Americans I can tell you from being on the ground here in America by the way over this last year a and in New York I was actually in I'm In California the bay area just a few weeks ago and here in Florida\nI I've been with the young college age crowd and there is an element that truly believes in this stuff they are and I think that's how you originally was targeting and now he's trying to balance that uh with the the sun the base here on the left in Israel which is in Florida which is more\nTo the center and and I do think\nThat that that's why this race is so defining if he ends up taking Florida with this radical background ... says about the Democrat Party is very telling and also I I Know that somebody like Kirsten Gillibrand a mainstream Democrat is going around with some of these same cast\nSo I I Know that somebody like Kirsten Gillibrand's mainstream Democrat is going around with some of these same cast of characters and she's also associating herself with this kind of ideology so\nIt says a lot that the Democratic party as a whole\nIs now I think that's often the director him\nPretty much openly while the media is sort of ignoring it so let's see if you take Florida and this is part of why I'm here and lived in paying so careful attention to Florida to this particular race this is not just about today this is about the future I write a party\nAnd then also if Trump can carry Florida and twenty twenty\nAaron Klein of ...

twenty nine here and I'm warning or no one at one point five WHM people catch up with the columns report and just a little bit Patty Healy registered nurses going to be joining us in just a little bit\nWe cannot take you as a patient right now this would actually happen yes it actually would and they would need to find a location to take me in order to meet my needs it might be Worcester they could call western western could say the same thing it could be Hartford it could be Albany in order to meet my needs\nSo I'm really very concerned about the fact that the government is going to tell nursing\nHow to do which job and it's all just a big numbers game I don't believe and I'm voting no on question on that the government should lead to tell nursing how it is to do their job\nOkay let's say there's something ... this one question that's come up a lot of people have asked me about this very thing and you're just kind of mentioned it to where you were airlifted out in general the the the scenario okay you said there was a disaster or something there's an explosion right down the street are we going to be doing headcount now\nYes there's only a health emergency which is things like the flu or that or the is the only thing that would supersede this particular act the bombing in Boston if there was an explosion if there was a derailment of a train if there was a C. O. two event in a high school if there was a school bus accident\nUm none of that would supersede this law and want to tell you is we drill in hospitals all the time for search for um disaster events and none of that is going to override this particular rule ...\nOkay I'm\nHospitals are fought nurses over collective bargaining are sort of thing and and they put up millions as well as you mentioned earlier they put millions of this campaign to fight this act it does seem a little bit adversarial here um why should hospitals to be taken seriously here by the rank and file\nWell I I have to be honest with you my building is a collective bargaining unit they state and local hospital is the collective bargaining unit\nAnd I'm going to tell you that there are nurses in our building that are not in favor of this not every single and then a nurse is in favor of this ruling many of the nurses in my emergency room or saying please don't tell me that we won't see patients if you're a patient who's coming in with a cardiac events\nThe nurses are saying please Michele his chief nursing officer don't tell me that I Will not be able to treat the patient that's coming in that need to my care\nSet the scene for us right now I Know what goes on hospitals right now or the nurses say that there is not sufficient time to spend with each patient and it's a it's affecting patient health they also talked about people come to the emergency rooms and there's not enough for personnel to comfortably move them to the rooms they need to go and that's the kind of scenario that's been painted right now\nOkay so I'm going to give you this is a real life scenario that happened to us\nI'm a gentleman and his wife are taking the granddaughter out to lunch he feels like he's having a little ingestion they dropped a granddaughter of driving home and the wife says you don't look good\nAnd he says I don't feel well either drives to her husband to Bay State noble hospital's emergency room is treated put on a monitor immediately and found that he was having an a cardiac event okay if this were January eighth okay and this law is enacted\nThey could come into the emergency room he could register as he would today and they could say I'm really sorry with the nurses on duty today I cannot even have to wait in the waiting room now and it's a numbers game behind the door I could have if I'm an emergency room nurse I could have someone who needs to have a suit you're put in\nI could have someone who were waiting ... cultures to come back\nWe could have somebody who is waiting to have someone come into said I'm a break and yet those patients are just as important and are the numbers that would be delegated to that nurse and the patient waiting out in the waiting room is not going to be seen\nFor talking to registered nurse Michelle urban juice the chief nursing officer and cheap administrative officer for basically a noble hospital and we're talking about question one about the staffing them nurses this was a patient safety act by the way our number down here is falling three five six seven one for all if you would like to pose a question to Michele urban\nSay question one passed mhm what is your hospital looking to do how would you react to that\nWell we have put a group together of nurse leaders from the hospital and we are looking at the gap analysis between\nThe staff that we have now and what we would need and there's two main areas of of um that we're going to be focusing on that's behavior house there is a behavioral health crisis in the state in the country\nAnd the best practice care guidelines for behavioral health patients isn't that a nurse driven a best practice it is a team approach with critical care with a\nMental health counselors with social workers and nurses inclusive this act would this proposal would put in nurses in a primary role right now there's a shortage of behavioral health nurses points so well I don't know if it's an area that some of\nThat may not be of interest right now um I I really can't answer that question right now but the truth of the matter is we would have to cut our inpatient census by half\nAccording to the nurses that we have until we could continue to hire ... the other area that's a major major concern is the emergency department um right now the nurses problem solved\nMs nursing shortage and I don't really know where we're going to be able to get nurses to do that no one thought that we've talked about it nurses from neighboring states Connecticut New York\nVermont New Hampshire main Rhode Island will seek license you're potentially in the state of Massachusetts polling nurses from those other neighboring states which will then affect patient care and other states and not just hours\nYou mentioned California California initially had a one to six years patient ratio which was presented\n'em when they initiated that it took years in order to implement this act and as it turns out in the ... surge area they downgraded to a one to five in the state of Massachusetts to one to for your patient ratio the other big difference in California it's there's no fine associated ... to think about this on any given day\nIf a patient comes in with a cardiac event in the emergency room and we treat that patient okay and an upstairs on them that surgery to let's say has uh an illness and needs to leave before we can replace her we could be fined fifty thousand dollars it's a lot of money that's an annual salary for health care worker\nAs a nurse yourself yeah Michelle urban um a lot of people do talk about nurses burnout\nAre no it's it's it's ... it's pretty good pay is pretty good benefits would solve that it always used to be very lucrative thing that people would get involved in the people who couldn't wait to get into nursing ... the the kids went to high school with is there a burnout factor here\nAre you yourself who've worked in in in in different words do you feel about yourself is that the reason why there's a shortage why people are getting into this like they used to\nWell I I Know that there are many people I'm graduating from nursing schools the issue is that we don't have enough instructors\nTo get to the nursing schools so that classes can be larger um I think there's burnout every career um nowadays I Will tell you that this mandate is not going to help that problem\nWe're talking about the question one that the patient safety act and the nurses staffing\nA bit so November six of the day where people can vote already I just as been early

director of community health and government relations at good comes in hospital and and liberal on who is the nursing director of critical care services as coup addicts and hospital we are here to talk to that question about question number one\nOn nursing staff ratios I'd want to actually get to the heart of this and there are a number of arguments going on around the periphery is that I think have no merit so let me dispensed with those and tell you what I really love to talk about okay\nI don't buy the argument that it's going to slow to take effect in January there'll be no time to implement it because it won't be implemented in January the legislature is going to change that date and or will be ignored\nJust as the legislature changed the marijuana dates 'em it's just not real in my opinion and it's going to take six months to a year to write the regulations which are going to be required in order to implement the law so high we can't do this in January was freak out it's not an argument to make weight or giving money to to\nThe other argument that I think Harry is no way it is this claim that there's twenty five thousand dollars per violation for hospital Everytime we don't have the right number of nurses on the word\nThat's nonsense in my opinion because the determination is not going to be made its first of all it's not twenty five thousand it's up to twenty five thousand it's an inch or cause it's supposed to get people to obey the law and the hospitals are doing their best no one's going to charge them twenty five thousand dollars that's not going to have I think that some equate argument\nI Do think that there are some serious arguments here about the question on itself and that's what I Would like to talk about it and that's about the ratios the problem and the money so if we could focus on that I Would appreciate it\nThe other arguments that I see on ... and the advertisements I just makes me want to scream just looks like frankly corporate propaganda but effective corporate propaganda in my opinion so here's where I'd like to start\nDo you think easier you Jeff on this or you and live Brian do you believe that there is in fact a problem that this valid question is trying to get to in other words\nAre there adequate nurses across the commonwealth and the hospitals is not a problem we don't have to deal with this the whole thing's bogus or is there a problem can we at least have some clarity on that because I think a lot of people are confused not necessarily confused as they've been in a hospital recently but\nAre confused about the hospitals things we don't need to do anything we've oppose this for Twenty years we've been successful in getting the legislature to do nothing congratulations us there is not a problem or is there a problem\nThat's a really good question they want to thank you for having a fan of sliding on there is a problem you know after that as a ... there is a solution that fits in

one on which we will vote next Tuesday we were speaking with Jeff foreigners who is the director of community health and government relations at who the concern hospital\nAnd and liberal on who is the nursing director of critical care services at could consider hospital\nLet's talk about the ratios if we might pose this question one this question question one set staffing ratios for nurses at hospitals one or the ratios that are set forth in question one\nSo the question one ballot sets ratios according to what level of care you're requiring so general med search patients would be what were the\nGeneral mid surge [laughter]\nYour your location on a medical surgical floor is in for you know a simple surgery or\nLet's let's go impulse or you don't want to hear I don't want to hear about really to you know neighbors yeah queasy queasy it's come kind of squeamish let's not go there\nSo what the dollar question called for those patients is one nurse for every four patients and that is whether you are fresh post stopped coming out of surgery or whether you're on day three waiting to go home and just you know everything is\nReady to go and you're just being ... and you're right you're waiting for the ride home and at no point does that consider the fact that you might need a different level of care because of where you are on your checked three of care\nSo let me see if I understand you have a one nurse for for patients on ... surge scared\n[laughter] I got I got I got it okay I sort of a\nAnd if they are all those patients are for example let's say with aids patients on the floor and they're all a day three post stop and they're all about to go home\nThey don't want you don't need a ... a one to four ratio for them on the other hand if someone's just coming out of a very serious surgery that person might need er nurse twenty four seven for a while\nRight need right a little better ratio than just one to four but if you are limited by your ratio is it's very hard to adjust and that's what nurses do they look at the whole situation they look at the condition of the patient and that's what about Clinton doesn't allow for the individual needs at the specific patients that sets across the board\nNumbers not on the specific needs of each patient and that's what now says two and a daily basis and those things can change 'em um moment to moment it's the nurse that decides exactly what that patient needs and the given moment\nAnd that has been a large part of the no on ONE Campaign this takes away discretion from nurses and what I'd like to know is why is that true because the ballot question itself sets up a minimum ratio so if you have\nFor nurses on than sixteen patience for that would be a very large unit but that said why even under the ballot initiative can't the nurses get together and with there's a supervisory of management people and say okay here's who the patients are today here's how we're going to pull your resources\nWhy does the ballot question in your judgment takeaways that discretion 'cause that's not how I read it but it's the points has made a lot by the new one quick to no one campaign so help me understand that from your perspective\nSo let's go back to that earlier situation we're talking about where you had the eight patients that are already difficult for discharge so we have eight patients they have to nurse and we should\nPoint out in the lives of nurses that's not how it works but okay\nLike that and and say there are two of my patients in the emergency room who are waiting to come up to the floor and really today we can say okay we can absolutely bring those patients and give them perfectly safe care\nBut once this ballot initiative if it were the half we wouldn't be able to pull the patience either the emergency room and we actually physically discharge the patience something that search beds and that means so stay or the or the legislature\nWrites in a an escape ... you know I have to do what you do with like ... ... okay\nBut that's where we got when we say it limits the ability of the flexibility of the nurses to make those decisions at this point\nBecause there has to be this minimum staffing level on the other hand it's a minimum Seventy level it's not a maximum Seventy level and so\nThe hospital would as soon in that situation put out a call for first of all we should note that if someone shows up the emergency room they're going to be treated valid question one yes or no they're going to be treated us federal law that person has to be treated\nAnd so they have to be treated\nTo be treated valid question one yes or no they're going to be treated as federal law that person has to be treated\nAnd so they have to be treated as second address\nThe question of admissions to the hospital and whether or not that would or wouldn't be delayed and I think that as a practical matter it wouldn't be delayed because people are going to say we'll get the nurses when we can this person needs to be admitted we're going to do was medically sound that's just how it's going to work in the real world events to make\nThat is you know I Can't imagine a nurse having can be put in that position and making that decision lights on and like going to follow the law and not see the same time I going to break the law and do what had been trying to do so what's happening even as an imposition everyday of having to make that decision and nobody is that in that position right\nAgain assuming the legislature wouldn't let us which is something I I think is really an impossible scenario going forward okay so one is the flexibility argument for nurses the other question or the other issue that seems to me is real\nHas to do with what this will cost and who will pay for it and I know that's a large part of the no on ONE Campaign so why don't you explain that position for us a Jeff honestly want to try that or in the run\nYour honor roll either want him\nHealthy though and so uh we'll talk about the concern for a minute our our projections of coups are concerned or that this will cost us between six and a half million ... million per year\nAnd that's for salaries for additional nurses obviously the resumes go into that but\nThe majority of that would be salaries there's also an acutely tool and we're making some assumptions that wages would rise because we're all going to be competing for the same all hospitals were competing for the same pool of nurses\nJeff ... second what's an acuity to let him\nGo to [laughter] basically how sick patients are but it does it it gives you a certain parameters\nOf ... um ... paying you know they need that patient require so we have them right now in the I feel is tied to the legislation for those and they share and the nurse in ...\nYou know all these different categories and parameters and then you know it's an objective truth that tells you it gives you a guideline number and they said they exactly how many patients should be paired with this patient in it a little like hair\nOkay let me go back because I did in Iraq just foreigners who is the director of community health and government relations echo the difference in hospitals we're talking about the money and how much would cost ... ... that's we've just heard from your mostly about salaries it for more nurses and more nursing care at the hospital in a year\nAnd I think you're going to tell me and we're not going to get reimbursed for that additional costs so\nPleased if well uh I think that's probably true I think we would try to negotiate insurance contracts to get some of that back but um you know it's a baby boomer era more people going on Medicare all the time and that's\nKosher Turkey's from empire come

weekend next\nBeing produced by valley like opera here to help us have a preview\nI don't know if they're going to sing for us or not I mean I needed a power does a member of the opera and the producer of the gone to ... years in Michael bud ... who is the state's director for this production of the gone to here's so much fun\nI Will not sing for you what I son one great and go [laughter] that's just in deference to Monte and his musical sensibility however Gilbert and Sullivan so much fun so much light so much energy such a terrific idea tell us what's going to be happening at the academy and why you chose the gun to leaders but those are with ah Michael but\nGreat I I heard you were in grade school a age let's put it for a very popular production for a grade schools\nThe guns are leaders is um after pirates presents and age and if it's in a four and the McCotter which many people know the ... is actually a the the next great uh upper editor Gilbert and sold and did and it was late in their collaboration and it's incredibly colorful\nIt's beautiful it's funny it's timely has\nIn their collaboration and it's incredibly colorful it's beautiful it's funny it's timely has a lot of topical political references that that are good to this day you know about a power versus people who are out of power um social democracy and\nAll kinds of things but so we have we have all of this wonderful production which by the way is huge just like all below productions of\nHuge in terms of the number of people here that huge in terms of everything their office are calling it valley heavy offer [laughter]\nSorry called late because it's a comedy it's funny it's really really funny but there are for the upper to forty people on stage including seven children\nUm if there is a full orchestra in incredible period costumes are our costs and people always do an amazing job sets designed by an architect a lighting designer who's a genius so it's it's quite an extravagant production\nTell us a little bit about Gilbert and Sullivan when they wrote in why they wrote these operas in apparatus\nAbsolutely it was the nineteenth century and they were the satirists of their time they did satire on politics and Gilbert ... early fake\nNews that's what you saw what are they and\nThey certainly they got out there and they lampooned as the people in power okay and also the social structure and it's so interesting 'cause it was Britain of course so there are so many parallels to the way America is now and that British sense of humor so subtle so you can\nAll almost like they're ... they're acting like they're they're um upper class Brits but they're making little Monty Python jokes all around all through it or ... jokes\nAnd the money that's where I got on micro cam right so we take the\nHumor and we expanded we give it a modern flair and some pop culture references and hum and here we are but the thing is\nNot only were they satirist and wrote some funny things\nBut some of it was a serious composer and so around all this witty dialogue and lyrics and wordplay ... what's that Gilbert was deliberate has lived yes Gilbert was the libretto and Sullivan wrote the music and he was a grand opera composer he composed EMS\nClassically trained and he wrote these wonderful\nOperas around this using he turned back into rock and roll chase it is amazing ... yet and so this collaboration actually happened\nWhen they were having a a right after they had a big fight [laughter] they're big fight because some of them was a serious composer and Gilbert kept during these witty comedies things and he said oh and I'm Richard grand opera and in Gilbert was so insulted you know what's wrong with our stuff [laughter] so here at the end\nOf of the day here it is over a hundred years later and everybody's heard of Gilbert and Sullivan and their operatives nobody's heard of ... grand opera [laughter] um but he did do one he wants called eyes and how\nBut if the Gilbert and which nobody's heard of it it's ... it's rarely performance so have you heard about it and I\nWith an op ed in Delaware and west Springfield cars how that's about the extent I Know\nHow but the other cool thing about Gilbert and Sullivan is it's the granddaddy of all grand American musicals on Broadway all those you hello Dolly and all those the grand musicals that have music\nAnd the highlight of the word Hamilton to make sure a lot of years ago about a lot of it but as I've handled and\n[laughter] I like to turn back if I might to power to as a member of who I'd offer as well as the producer why do you love this particular Gilbert and Sullivan production\nUm I've been doing these productions now for many years and it is a political relevance and the intensity of the music is just beautiful and the the phrasing that certain characters bring to that music it just it's beautiful\nIt's just really funny and in some of the twist that Michael is added because they do keep these ... these musicals relevant updating the politics it's astounding how much things stay the same in ever change and how much change never changes and it it's these twists that happen\nAnd the more you pay attention the subtlety is it's it's really funny that that's one thing I'm repeating myself\nBut I Would like to go back to one\nA point that ah Michael ... made that has to do with a ... it's very heavy opera 'cause there are so many people involved how many individuals altogether make up the the the production because\nYou don't resolve is known for its course it's there where if you're in grade school and you can't sing very well you can be placed than I Do too much\nNow we're all saying well I I'm sure you're also of course is it however in the fourth\nGrade I ... that my voice has not improved a lot since then and Monti will do for take no you won't thank you very much but how many people altogether\nThey are thirty seven numbers I Believe on stage singing and in one of the wonderful things about Gilbert and Sullivan is that it's like a true greed course they are considered another cast member they are not the courses a character cabaret they are the character they bring the rest of the store and they have like visual identity is learning to\nBeing in acting is not limited to just you know the people in the front you are\nThe village sandwich as it takes a village to create a show it's not something that all the characters on stage they say how many people on stage that's thirty seven\nThere's a tremendous um volunteer orchestra there are this set designers and all the ... and they are they the entire village of people you never see onstage choreographers one little dysfunctional family as I'd like to say\nLike I had a person brings they end up close to a hundred there are tremendous number ...\nAnd you you learn the idiosyncratic in idiosyncrasies and each person behind the scenes on stage and it's really\nThe heaviest that he is of a hundred percent panels ... always good to have you lived there\nFor one show it and then there's some people who were there for every show there are members who have been part of these shows

all the research I've been doing\nWell how can I be of service would this upcoming adventure\nShow clock it but no poke around for rental car prices on the Internet on there and Costa Rico though boy found one on one with the way it looked like a dollar a day oh yeah that's probably too good to be truth on most of the others are in the ...\nOkay so Costa Rica comes with an unpleasant surprise when you rent a car okay\nThe government there is one of the few countries on earth that the government makes you buy a whole bunch of pseudo semi fake crummy insurance type products with your rental\nSo when you see a car rental company for Costa Rica listing raided a dollar a day or five dollars a day or whatever they're just trying to more un and then for the government mandated semi insurance things they charge you a fortune\nSo we've got a loss leader and what I've recommended in the past with Costa Rica is rent from a well known and recognize company\nBut before you even do that you want disclosure from them which they will have on their website what the mandatory a semi insurances are going to cost you\nOkay so\nExpect the car rental in Costa Rica to be actually a fair amount more money than you have anticipated\n... teams are closer to accurate\nNo it'll be more than that with all the junk they make you get okay\nBut again there's a range on the junk fees like one company maybe two or three times the cost of another for this stuff that the Costa Rican government requires you have you know normally when I travel somewhere\nI anywhere in the world I refuse all the pseudo insurance if the car rental company tries to get me to get because of the coverage I have my own auto insurance even outside the United states and then I have a credit card that covers the gaps in

I called the better Business Bureau and they said it will headache touch waiting Suffolk I looked at it\nSo I continue that show that an application and my question is they keep coming back with other things that I had a shadow of failed out yet I graduated college in Nineteen sixty eight I Want to copy of my college degree I said I don't have that\nThey can we add the fact that they otherwise low wage will go up because that makes sense I don't question did I guess that that is a scam paying or his second is typical\nNo every lander uses different underwriting standards and the one asking for a copy of a college degree\nFrom years ago yeah that's pretty crazy I've never had that come up after a year when people alive for mortgages it's not unusual now to have a level\nOf documentation has to be provided that seems so intrusive\nI for mortgages it's not unusual now to have a level of documentation has to be provided that seems so intrusive and so unnecessary but it's how that market works now but for personal loan to ask you all that kinda stuff seems really weird\nIt does and what I said what's your ... ... they can we check out database and you didn't graduate but why is that it did I say yes I did all that you had like make no I didn't go to college and get like Eric I can now go to college yet what oh\n[laughter] [laughter] it\nKinda makes it that I certainly think that it doesn't seem like it's like something wrong here you know and I get that ship our surrogate community and maybe I should just\nDrop what kind of interest rate or they promising you\nKnow they have a fourteen attached to\nWhat is your personal a line of credit rate is at at Paul makes accent\nOkay and where does Europe fit into borrowing this money our team per se\nI because my daughter is going to like getting out of his money to start off there\nShe's moving to Europe\n... huh\nSo how she uh she's an adult\nYou know alright ... okay it's a last fall\nWell I'm gonna I'm gonna get a little I'm gonna be a little too personal here but I'm just I'm just curious why are you taking out a loan at fourteen percent which was a pretty high interest rate right\nNow that are paying for it\nBecause her credit fact that she couldn't get a lot of his ankle and she has a job that she got she got the actual title back from hard job but it will be in my own that's\nAll right for you do that I Would like for her to test the waters and see if she could borrowed the money and lending club or prosper\nActually write this down yeah fucking oh God I didn't know you're going to get there\nAnd that's all right I'll put you on a in a minute I'll put you on hold and we'll make sure we give you this information winning carbon prosper or non traditional lenders where investors see the purpose of alone and decide whether or not they wanna funded\nAnd based on her credit score the rate is a is according to her credit score but I I Would much prefer for her particularly if she's going to Europe she has a job that you think is gonna really happened\nI Would much prefer for her to be the one who has to pay the loan because if she says she's gonna pay you back and then doesn't right and the lender Ireland or doesn't care you're stuck with that loan\nAnd now I Know that I'm not the only way that I don't think that what happens then you get that that's a possibility that it won't allow\nBecause at the point in life you were at um I don't like for you to be taking on a new debt obligation\nYou understand why right because I won't go there\nAnd I know you're doing something from the best of your heart and best of intentions for your daughter but gosh I don't want you to put yourself in harm's way okay\nSo at least at least let her try and I put you on hold we're going to give you the information on these two winters again they're prosper dot com and lending club dot com Jason joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jason\nO clock at the public thought well great to have you here and

you're halfway home and you've done all of that by your twentieth birthday which is fantastic\nSo this is a little bit difficult to say what you should do because the sooner you you're in your entrepreneurial pursued\nThe sooner it is that you may be able to make some serious money\nAnd so the money you invest could generate nice income for you so if I get you to divert you're allowed to put fifty five hundred dollars into a Ross each year I get you to divert fifty five hundred dollars you've now wiped out a ... percent\nOf the money that you've worked so hard to save the haven't wiped it out but you've diverted it to save for retirement and then it's not there to help you start your construction business\nYeah so when you are in your own business there are many different ways for you to put money aside for retirement there's massive flexibility for a self employed individual or small business owner\nSo I Know this is gonna sound backwards from what I always talk about in your case I Would stay single minded as an entrepreneur\nAnd keep living on much less than you make putting as much cash as you can towards the stash you're going to need to start your business\nAnd that should be your single minded goal entrepreneur wars have to be single minded and their pursuit of their business goals\nCool down [laughter]\nOkay so I'm I Can't believe I'm even saying this I
