Trump\nWill ... that's what the United states does have and that was that was what the founding fathers intended ah George Washington and particularly but others who who framed the

when I when I could go line provides\nA the United states imbued it's\nGreat documents the declaration of independence the constitution the bill of rights or with a mystical powers in the symbols of

hundred years\nWith the possible exception of the uh the early part of the mid ... century and the Dow Jones has to she\nBut basically we were looking at the U.S with uh all the uh thirty of that except for the unfortunate aspect that the u._s. monarchs us presidents\nAre uh from political parties and become partisan and so you always have a U.S president representing essentially half the population whereas an historical constitutional monarchy represents the entire nation and leaves the partisanship down into that\nCertainly what we've struggled with these last week so the what the president what our constitutional monarchy has now blessed is a hoax\nIn the advice and consent process for a now associate justice Brett Kavanaugh it was partisanship bare knuckle partisanship and it continues air Greg great we're waiting for you to come home and experience it\n[laughter] is what I've been watching it a ... a ... minute by minute a and look it it's no different here where we're seeing a lot of um a constitutional monarchy is Canada Australia and the like\nAre becoming more presidential in their approach to politics they the crown as is often disregarded\nA and you get prime ministership starting particularly with Tony Blair and Britain\nAre who are basically\nUh actors that with ... um now I I think we're seeing a swing away from that which is positive or an ... is the it's interesting thing although Trump or was nominally Republican or he attempted to come in as someone who represented the historical interest of\nThe United states the which is the balance nation state\nWhich has been forgotten essentially since World War two balanced nation state uh became basically the urban state dominating everything and that was contributed to buy the enormous growth of productivity by the agricultural sector which enabled more and more people to leave the ... the city's\nSo ... ... really distorted the balance\nBut Trump from chief resistance is in the urban global as society here on the coast this special east coast that's where he finds the opposition and it continues through the cabinet experience we have thirty seconds here Gregory this the swing to nationalism were just as the beginning of the cycle correct we can't\nWe can't we can't at this point predict where we're going but isn't that natural consequence of nationalism clashes along

basically\nIt will always happen in times of crisis in times of transition so it's not a function of nationalism it's a function of human society\nYes we are seeing a revival of ... of a focus on

for\n\nIt is a Florida is interesting for a couple of reasons first of all the early turnout has worked a heavily for Democrats in Miami Dade or what fascinates me about floor is two things but they really John that's environment it's your environment in terms of us can test me what's going on in the form of red algae and red ties and blue algae a\nGovernor boys senator senator plans to governor for this problem a three inch or bad the question is who they take it out on and now we have something else coming into play and that hurricane politics as we speak or a hurricane is barreling down on the Florida Panhandle uh watch\nSenator Nelson watch Governor Scott just steamy to actually go over this uh nobody would ... hurricane of state but if there's such thing as a tourist town and it's one of the center is up for re election and the governor is challenging et cetera and they will bend over backwards to help the state\nBill the puzzle about Florida here is that this is more of the President's Day than New York yes he's very keen on the Florida vote that was a critical factor for his success is he is he a weapon here in the last weekend for Scott's\nA first got the mainly for the St is I think is the one to look for John\nI say the governor's race the governor or generate\nWho is who is tight with Trump much tighter than Scott as so we'll see if Trump is invited down there to campaign\nAnd this is why the midterms are interesting and it's not just the ... or what also in Wisconsin where where Scott Walker is running for yet another term ... water Scott Walker election is not just about Scott Walker John it's also about Republicans organized for the presidential election remember Walker this is what the fourth time now I think that walkers run statewide he's run twice\nIn regular schedule lectures John there was a recall ever they defeated the one thing about the last time Walker a red in Wisconsin which was totally fourteen John that was in some respects a dress rehearsal for Republicans and twenty six to eight in the presidential\nVery easy to convert his resources that are presidential candidate is one of the reasons why Donald Trump ended up winning that state so let's see in states like Wisconsin in Florida and you know for the ... states were total deterrent selection but see how organized Republicans are and how that could have had a chance

the house Judiciary Committee\nI'm from Manhattan mentioned impeachment aback cabin on peach meant much in the air I think that hurts the Democrats but they keep it up can they stop it bill\nUm I don't know if they can control themselves look I if they're teaching Donald Trump\nWe can agree is politically dead end job why Democrats right Democrats control Congress they might have enough votes to get out of committee puts you got out on the floor John but it goes to says they will not five fifty seven votes to conduct Donald Trump or whatever they charge him if that is a waste of time I think\nTrying to impeach Brett Kavanaugh's just politically brain dead and I cannot understand why they even go down that road\nUm but yet there are there are Democrats who are just you know hell bent

right now in America and how much are they producing of what the United States needs for uranium good evening to you mark\nYeah good evening to you John um I mean we have a number of projects that are located and mainly in the four corners region of the United states but we have projects from the state of Wyoming or down south through Colorado\nI'm Utah Arizona New Mexico into Texas so right now we have a three production centers that are actually producing of and they are your am a and two of those are are producing as we speak\nNow now Nichols ranch I in Wyoming a ... white may say in Utah and also ... in Texas\nYes the only one that's on standby is all tomatoes in Texas\nAnd you have uranium mines around these production facility so how does it physically work I've never visited uranium mine ... mine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production centers are are are have are different is that a couple of ways that we have conventional\nFacilities where you actually physically mine drilling blast the the the or\nI'm transported to the person the facility in this case is white Mason meal where it's conventionally posts asked um which is crushing grinding and chemical extracting uranium Orban avium\nWithin our project in Wyoming and in Texas are called is set to recovery and it's such a recovery is where you actually\nDissolve the uranium in place in the ground you actually don't physically mine is so so there there are two different methodologies and about half the uranium the United states is or in in in the world actually is mind by both methods so about fifty percent is either conventional or in such a recovery\nAnd your company's doing very well and people can participate but there's a but the body as how much does the United states need in uranium and how much does the U.S produce and where do we get it\nYeah well the um United States the largest consumer uranium the world are between power generation which was about twenty percent of our electric power in the United states\nAnd then you have the nuclear navy um my a calculation\nWe consume about one third of the total uranium consumed in in the world\nUm but but just for power generation loan because the actual use for the military has classified\nUm but for power generation alone we consume about fifty million pounds of uranium per year for power generation now currently a worldly mining a a ... percent of our requirements which is a shocking shortfall because arrested that's coming in from imports\nAre from both our allies but also from a number of a former or a communist countries you know like this or Russia or in Kazakhstan or its allies and um it was back a stone and even China so um that is why we filed a section two thirty to petition to limit\nA imports of uranium primarily from uh allies with a former Soviet Union\nLet me take this and if I understand this doesn't sound commonsense ago we're importing uranium we need for our nuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing it\nFrom Russia and from China or in less changed that tells me our supply chain is in the hands of our phones correct\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's that's the point of our petition is is the United states the United states\nAs the largest consumer of uranium in the world um is is are we ready to turn over the reins to um you know to those countries you know I I I don't\nThe answer is no ... we're not we're we're not mark you're not asking hard questions [laughter] okay five but before we we look into your a conversation with the Trump Administration in the department of commerce as to what we'd have to say as a missed pricing of uranium uh what is the navy and what are we use it for\n... is is primarily used as an hour away I'm for steel hardening but it is also currently getting additional I'm a demands on it from a va navy employee batteries for renewable energy storage\nAnd you ... at the white ... and a white Mesa mail is that where you're processing\n... well yeah we we process there and we're starting to recover of an ATM ah we'll start in ... in November of this year to start a producing a gimmick in we we last produced an ATM in two thousand Thirteen\nAh we actually mine the ore are in the surrounding mines and the district and we transferred it by truck as I mentioned earlier a but this initial campaign where actual recovery even avium that is in solution or ... or ... facilities that are holding pond so we're very excited about this\nIs the demand for an ATM climbing\nA the demand is climbing a quite substantially probably six seven percent per year and um the price of an ATM has increased from\nA brown four five six dollars per pound to three years ago up to north at twenty dollars per pound so um it's you hear a lot of talk about the battery elements hum metals a you know like lithium graphite\nCobalt or will the navy I Am a is sort of the next to the queue and it comes from an energy renewable energy storage a type of metal or but still at this they currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and ah there's currently a\nA news owning a in China this requiring the rebar\nOr to be a certain tests strength and it's very difficult to achieve\nThat without using the atrium so there's a new source of demand which is the rebar and the ... even flow batteries\nBack to your conversation with the Trump Administration about uranium we need much more uranium than the United states is now producing your the number one producer of uranium in the country so what can be done what is the department of commerce I'm looking into what is the investigation tell us\nWe we we follow the petition and and we asked for two things we asked for a quota another tariff quota\nThat the United states should produced at least twenty five percent of the requirements are from domestic sources to allow enough critical mass so that we actually have a uranium mining industry sustainable in the United states\nWe also asked for by American uranium and and you know the the administration has his you know by American\nOr in the first place so that fits in nicely with with our request so uh but it's just it's a quota and it's uh\nThe key here is to maintain a healthy a front into the fuel cycle that does not put us dependent on a sneeze pour source of uranium primarily from these uh uh you know countries that are associated with former Soviet Union\nAnd mark which is we have less than a minute here uh do do our photos China and Russia did they subsidize their uranium industry in order to out compete\n... yes I Do I mean the the Russia and China they have national programs that support their nuclear fuel cycle\nAnd the United states used to but it no longer has that so that's why it's so important right now because if if if we'll out the nuclear fuel cycle to completely go way and the United states uh countries like Russia and China are not going to lead there's go way they're going to continue to fast forward\nMark ... is the c._e._o. of energy fuels is traded publicly more to the point the Trump Administration has conversation started about how it is that we're buying uranium from Russia and China\nI'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nDo any age him\n[noise] data files impact you fog tonight overnight lows sixty sixty six percent

they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that he's astronaut picked question\nBased acted Vandenberg why Bob what what are they need Vandenberg for\nWell they need to space what's Vandenberg stadium all they want to stay sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solar synchronous orbits these orbits around the polls from Kennedy because you'd have to fly over populated territory and the west coast space port has been used by for\nLiterally for a half century by the military and private enterprise to get satellites into a polar orbit and so now SpaceX has been flying out of vending machine for years but this past weekend\nThey had their first successful launch from Vandenberg\nBut when they landed the first stage farmland at Vandenberg they'd built a land landing site literally right next to the launch pad literally within sight within fifty a hundred two hundred yards of it and they brought that uh that first stage back it was blocked by first stage which is the first\nThat they're finally to ration their how this was that goal if they get it to land right next to the launch pad they can turn it around and maybe launch within twenty four hours that's their goal and so they had that success\nIt's part of the ... and you know the races space sects keeps moving forward John it's a it's a sign for the future\nNot a delay and tell us why do these things seem familiar\n[laughter] it's an endless story well there's there's ... there's an Inside Story that is not confirmed yet that I Want to add to this a few last year Congress gave Nasser extra money to flow\nThe ... upper stage for Estelle essay would not produce as much a pass powerful rocket but it would allow them to fly a few missions they needed to fly a ...\nBefore before they had the final integration of the most powerful\nUpper stage well it appears now they're slowing down development on that at upper stage that final upper stage and they're putting more money and the scheduling low launches with the interim upper stage which is powerful and it there is even hands that they are going to discontinue work on that more powerful upper stage\nThis is only after maybe five years of work on that more powerful upper stage spending lots and lots of money and they've just decided they can't afford to build it so they'll go with the ... stage there in the ... the road put this up on behind the black and they quote the vice president and program manager of\nSpace launch system for Boeing and he makes this statement\nI'm a there has been a slow down on the exploration upper stage work he also said that uh we under estimated quote that timeframe\nInvolved somewhat and I call that possibly the biggest understatement ever in the universe because SOS has been basically under construction since ... for in some iteration or another and it's not going to launch its first manned mission until\nTwenty twenty three and it won't even be the most powerful rocket\nSo we have a commercial crew news as well Bob is this also disappointing\nDisappointing but it's not as a absurd\nAn asset this week released an updated scheduled for the dragon install lying a test flights these are the cap privately built capsules to bring people die assessed and that meant stay sex headed the way it's first manned test flight until June ... they didn't\nGet the ... the time between the two missions is the same so it was just because the schedule essentially\nAt I assessed they had to delay it and a bowling schedule pretty much stays the same so there's been a slight delay that won't be any commercial crew launches this year but with that right now it looks very clear that they're going to all be happening next year\nI'm a ... says we're now going to be giving updates on schedule on a much more frequent basis because we're really firming things up for example the Boeing flights they'd give\nVery rough uh proximate periods like mid twenties Nineteen\nDenouncing clearly the first unmanned to in March twenty Nineteen and the first flight manned flight that August twenty Nineteen so they really from the schedules up we should look at safe sex first unmanned in January Boeing's first unmanned in March a space sex first\nManned in June and then Boeing banned in August every other month is like the Gemini program back in the Nineteen sixties it'll be very exciting\nThis year just finished a cost to pay for had corner a we have two different directions Bob what how they're going to settle this is there a tug of war team that's going to show up and\nTurf war within a the bureaucracy um you know Trump is pushing for a new space Boston so the military bureaucracy is putting forth all kinds of falls about what they should do [noise] um\nI'm not sure even plan is a good while on both of that one of them from the agency from the military itself suggests creating an agency that they say a smaller and will be more lean Mike Griffin who is for them and that certainly straight who's now been put into\nOur secretary of defense for research and engineering my\nYes and he was basically fit into the space area it's supposed to be there to deal with military space he's proposing a different idea which would create a new space agency for the military with the staff of a hundred and twelve people and I have to say when reading just initial report it\nSeemed like his was more bloated than the other I'm not sure which is why I'm the one thing that Griffin was doing that the military proposed\nAir force secretary Heather Wilson ... as well to\nThat she's in charge so Griffin was pushing more the threat to trends a transition in the military to using private commercial assets rather than building that's all and um\nBut his apparent love to build his own empire here might work against that goal I'm not sure which works I I once again my real reservations about the state's forces that I'm worried it's going to just turn into a a big bureaucracy that won't really accomplish very much they just simply need to consolidate the ups and\nBob you're not thinking about we need our space uniforms we need patches of merchandise we need all the things you're trying to bypass Bobby Washington they only build empires that's what they do\nI Know this is the tragedy that's why I have reservations about the whole idea I'm not sure they're going to the the people who work in Washington to my mind the bureaucrats they're all very little interested in the national interest nowadays the only thing they seem to be interested in it appears to me is their own agency interests\nAnd they read as a national interest can go to act by\nBob and I I have to get that uniform and the patch and so if they need to build an empire to get to it All right fine we go now to China because there's news on Chang eat for this is the next lunar is this the far side of The Moonlit earth yes\nThis is the land that's going to go on the far\nSide of the moon and the schedule is now tend to lay a pretty firmly tentatively that that that sounds weird uh sometime in December the key is that they've got three launches for the same space fought to do other things prior to it and if anything goes wrong in any of those launches that will delayed Chang for\nBut right now they're set to land on the far side of the mood some launch sometime in December and that will land some very shortly thereafter there's a lot of other information including details about the landing site which is in a crater called bar von Carmen\nIs on the far side of the moon in a can base and and the pictures of what what would what looks like on the surface it's rough on the side of the boat ah they already have their relay satellite in orbit around the moon ready to relate that us as much on the far side you can't directly talk to the earth\nThis is a big deal if they succeed John we gotta cross

I uh appropriately\nEnough both of the races Lee named a baseball team the brave than the Indians were out on indigenous peoples\nThat I did pick that up [laughter]\nWhich is totally appropriate because our guest this morning is Melinda ... Lowery she's an associate professor of history and directed the center for the study of the American south at the University of North Carolina UNC Chapel Hill\nHer previous book is lumpy Indians and the Jim Crow south in her new book is the lumpy Indians and American struggle\nWhile we are here busy pulling back the curtain on how all this actually works I should let you our listeners know that there are a number of publicist and number of a publishing houses who I Am in contact with regularly\nWho suggest authors we might be interested in speaking with and I was particularly interested in speaking with more than ... Lowery again her new book is the lumber Indians and American struggle\nBecause I had lived on them a nominee Indian reservation for a period of time and practice law out there after law school\nAnd I was fascinated to learn because the ... nominees or the one tribe that still has a reservation regional tribal land use of the Mississippi and I was struck by this a synopsis of the book the long the Indians\nBecause it pages over all of the kind of deep deep or degrees of diversity including gender and including class including educational background for example or profession\nAll those are ways that we need to reckon with one another as as we tried to belong to this nation together\nThe ... story I think shows us how\nA nation like the lumpy nation can deal with race and and um [noise] deploy race when it's absolutely necessary for example when we're dealing with outsiders who have no one other kind of understanding of\nHuman culture than attach it to race but how at the same time we can put aside race and we can think about citizenship and and how to move forward with things that we share rather than things that divide us so the conclusions that I've drawn from this research are that racism is a deeply divisive\nUm term that doesn't it doesn't ... it doesn't lead is much towards justice and self determination often as as this society actually needs\nWhom ask you this because I was struck when I was living on the nominee on the roads and in Wisconsin\nThat to be a member of the nomination of the ... tribe there needed to be ... a certain percentage of my nominee heritage and it was almost like these blood surety tests the that the federal government imposes on\nIndians on Native Americans to determine whether or not they can or cannot be a member of the tribe is there anything like that in the lumber nation\nWhile we're affected by all of those same dynamics so I'm In the Nineteen thirties actually an anthropologist list\nOur head shape and ... year low shape and I nose hair texture all of these things to kind of determine\nWhether we met the federal government's criteria for being half or more Indian blood and that's an extremely problematic kind of science that was dominant at the time but it was also dominant in Nazi Germany you know and the ways in which people talk about blood and blood quantum have\nDeeply affected lumpy history but the ... tribe as a matter of enrollment has said you need to demonstrate your dissent from\nA person identified as Indian on a certain set of documents that stem from around the turn of the twentieth century and when you can identify your dissent from an individual listed as Indian on one of those documents and you can demonstrate other kinds of affiliation with our territory\nThat's the basic criteria for for membership and the ... tribes so there's not a particular percentages of Indian heritage or so called Indian blood that people need to belong to the community but there's all they also need to demonstrate their affiliation with the community so they need to know what their family ties are\nYou know they need to have an understanding of our community history or places are\nThe things about our rituals that are important to us um and so it's not just a matter of a heritage or descent but it's also a matter of belonging and that's how the lumber people have chosen to deal with that particular imposition by the federal government\nFinal question to find my professor Lowry any chance that some of these will be recognized by the federal government or is that just to forewarn and gone hoping\nYeah I think there's always a chance I think the thing about it is that it's it's a matter of politics now you know who holds the most sway and in our national discussions about what it means to Institute a policy fairly and for long days it's a matter of justice at this point I think justice is always achievable\nWe've been speaking with professor moon demeanor Lowery her new book is titled the one being Indians in American struggle book will be available and is available through your local independent bookstore and if you must and Amazon thank you professor already for really

corroborating evidence concerning his character drunkenness a you know behavior around a girls and women and um\nIt it I I have to say that as a former journalist and as a woman I I Am just sort of

figure out uh what type of discipline or reprimand is appropriate and you know there's always\nThis idea of handling such incidents on a case by case basis and of course what happens I'm In

our energy in the United states\nThat number may be off a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now\nNatural gas is in shorter supply than it's been in recent years as we head towards colder weather months and one of the ironies of natural gas is it's now used for things way beyond just providing heat\nBecause more and more power companies around the country use natural gas as their main source to produce electricity so natural gas has gone from being a smaller market\nServing heating needs for people and in certain households providing a natural gas cook tops there's a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity\nIsn't that weird to say but yes even though natural gas has used for both bats the big change so the overall market demand for natural gas is much larger\nThe current supply a little smaller and so what does that mean and the market it means that we have a decent chance of seeing higher prices on natural gas\nAnd remember you've got hit on both sides of the equation even if you don't use natural gas hey you're home you're still affected almost certainly on the electricity side\nSo no one can know what's gonna happen with the wintertime temperatures are we going to see a cold winter or not it's going to be another mild winter we don't know that\nBut what we do know is that the odds are higher than we could see price spikes so what I

right\nKnow as simple as there's humming ample about a simple simple virus pretty extensive paperwork or sap does not\nAnd when I went to like you to do is I have a list of companies that you can trust\nTo advise you on how you handle building a retirement plan some of that stuff you said to your so puzzled you feel like you've gotten burned trying to make decisions\nAnd I've got a list of companies that you can invest directly with and then I have two groups you could go to where you can talk with somebody\nWho can advise you and if you choose even have somebody who you pay to manage retirement funds for you yeah and focus on your business and have them do it one of the group is Garrett planning network that you'll see on Clark dot com\nThe other is not for the national association of personal financial advisors\nAnd either those groups you can you can see they use different strategies to help you and then look at my investment guide for companies that I really trust for you to use for that and investing guidance for your retirement account\nSteven is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steven\nHeadache arcade I'm\nGreat thank you you're saving for a home I Am congratulations\nSo my wife and I recently got married than the last ... congratulations again\nThank you and so on our tax return and we've got a little bit more back to their expecting wanting to start saving for a down payment Ali ten years from now\nMy goodness you're an advance planner I have never had anybody ever called me about saving for a down payment on a house or to purchase a house who said it was something they were doing ten years out that's amazing\nWe're trying to plan ahead a little bit like ... and other problems look I Will it they'll have like a pill we're just wondering what is the best place to put our money and we should just put it in Iraq IRA and then I ... when we need it\nOr if yeah I mean if you got a ten year window that really changes the answer and you are right just continuing to make your deposits in your Roth IRA\nAnd the freedom you have to withdraw contributions a decade from now with no consequences in terms of penalty or tax\nWould be a very\nIntelligent strategy and when the ten year window you can take more risk with the money then you would what would be really consider to be short term risk that long term smart then you could if you were doing something like like putting money in a savings account today\nYeah so and the savings ... each year\nWhat type of fun to ... a charter retirement fund or you\nLive I Will do a balance find like the vanguard star fun\nOkay if you look at the star fun requires a thousand dollar minimum to open and then has a very diverse portfolio of what your money goes into\nAnd you do stand the risk and the shorter term you know at some point we could have a correction we will have a correction in the stock market and you could think that I gave you the worst advice ever\nRight telling you to put money at risk and investments but again we're talking a ten year period and going into something like the star fund is a moderate risk choice\nTo invest money in has extremely low cost for the management of it and then what happens is let's say ten years from now you are pulling money out for the down payment\nYou don't touch any of the earnings\nBecause if you pull out earnings then you get hit with tax and penalties\nOr just the contribution right and with\nThe with the contributions it's a completely non event as far as the IRS 'cause concert\nAnd if you end up in a position a decade out you're buying a home and you don't need to touch as much money as you expect it from the Roth or maybe your circumstances change and you don't need to touch any of it all the good cause you would have had already a ten\n\n\n\n\nHave any major city to a gym [noise]\nThe news on the hour category presented like Sarah works really\nGood one afternoon from Panama City beach or clean Michael

[noise]\nThere was information moving around on security blogs\nAbout a criminal ring that had tapped into payment terminals at a handful of restaurant chains now there's more information put out by the fads that the ring was based and Eastern Europe\nAnd that they have at least Fifteen million\nActive credit card and debit card numbers even though the ring as a there's some members of the ring that have been arrested it doesn't mean that the numbers are safe\nAnd there are any number of chains already known and there will be others that will come to light probably ... ... why can't winter break on anything can be\nOur bees see who else they've said chilies red Robin Jason's jelly and then a number of hotels\nAnd resorts that are not a dinner fried yet or name they may be known to the

they were able to do so in the underlying architecture of accounting of payment systems at restaurant chains and the as yet unnamed hotel chains so\nWhat you need to know as a consumer is that if you suddenly get a notice from your credit card company that you're getting a new card\nWithout any other explanation\nIt may be that they believe your number is one of the ones who are compromised\nIn this and are they may tell you that your card was used at a place that was subject to a breach but many times the first you'll know that\nIs when activity occurs on your account\nThis may end up even

and the idea is that buying things basically you're buying a boat products instead of individually package putting them in your own packaging\nThat that reduces a big cost out of the system in addition to the environmental thing\nThan the other idea that is one that is involving trust our co ops opening up around the country where there is no employee there you have to be a member\nTo buzz yourself in which\nYou're a member of the co-op and you it's an honor system\nFor the items you're buying their cameras watching you typically but it's an honor system and you pay for the items you

Dave you've got a gripe about Amazon\n[noise] I certainly do [noise] I'm In a member for a long time [noise]\nI'm always enjoyed your service however lately it seems like I'm not getting to de service shipping\nA change like I'm getting four five six day shipping a I order some for my garage door my batteries went bad I ordered some replacement batteries\nA on a Wednesday morning at eight am [noise]\nThe uh noticed I got the shipping noticing it was saying today the following week\nAnd I called and said hey what's going on all will expedite it overnight for you know ...\nShower [laughter] and they came on Monday [laughter]\nWell they Amazon is training and they are doing every experiment they can come up with to try to get their deliveries back to being reliable\nBut there's a there's been a deterioration that any\nAmazon Prime loyalist would see exactly what you are saying\nAnd his experienced it themselves that the delivery frames are not meeting the two day promise anymore in fact the Amazon now says the two days means from when they've actually fulfill the order is not two days from when you order now\nOh yes and I guess the worst one was on the black Monday I really wanted a Fifteen inch TV for the three hundred dollars [noise]\nOrdered it and unfortunately we were going on vacation on friday of that week we were leaving five AM in the morning ordered the TV on Monday and got to notice that it was shipping on what's going to arrive on friday\nAnd I called and I said this won't work and they said well ... and they gave you me exactly the excuse they gave me was the TV had to be repackaged and pulled off the shelf in the warehouse and shipped [noise]\nAnd I said well that will work there will not be anybody here on friday\nAnd they said well sorry there's nothing we can do you just have to cancel so I did\nI immediately sent an email canceling the order\nAnd about two hours later I got an email saying we can't cancel your order\nThat okay let me explain that how that could happen so that's been a really confusing thing for people Amazon as I understand it from what I've read is doing a lot of what's known as direct ship from uh manufacturers are from wholesalers\nWhere it's never passing through an Amazon warehouse is shipping from a manufacturer or distributors warehouse and once they put in that order\nThat's how it's being rounded to you\nWith a third party delivery service so on Amazon Prime you were a member of cause it's like a victim of its own popularity and success is not the Amazon Prime of anymore\nAnd I understand but the problem was I didn't want to fifty inch TV sitting on my front I learned my pirate run off with it exactly right so\nLet me let me cut to the chase on this with Amazon to day delivery\nNo longer means two days except by whatever calendar Amazon uses however if you do get some of the incomes late and you call Amazon the most common thing they'll do for you is extend your prime an additional month for free\nSo\nYou get something for it but if you were hoping that Amazon in the near future is going to go back to being reliable worshipping forget it\n[noise] ah [laughter]\nI think about it if they've got how many members they have now they keep raising the cost or prime and it doesn't seem to make any debt and the popularity of it and the number of people want to sign up\n[noise] I understand but it it sure doesn't help me when I Need the items and quite frankly I I'm not convenient stores\nOkay so I Would suggest experimental it'll try ... dot com which is a retail are a lot of people really love\nAs an alternative to Amazon they have no membership fee or you can try an even number of people you can try boxed I don't know if you've ever tried box Rio X E D dot com seems to me putting a smile on a lot of people's faces are there are there are alternatives even if\nYou are not an area convenient stores\nThere are these smaller competitors Amazon that maybe are worth a look as Amazon has disappointed you at least these two times recently\nCarlos is with us on the Clark Howard show however Carlos Carlos you have a terrible situation involving a broken heart and I'm Sorry about what you suffered through lately\nThank you so I was engaged um and I bought a wedding band an engagement ring\nUm spend a total of ten thousand dollars so we ended up breaking everything off and so I've got a this jewelry um G L A certified um you know from a reputable place so what are my options as far as selling\nWell [noise] ah I should tell you that this is a terrible dilemma with broken engagements and like one in three engagements don't make it to the altar so don't feel like you're the Lone Ranger on that\nOr doesn't heal your heart any easier but a dime and once it's purchase from a retailer ring purchaser retailer will not bring anywhere near that value for you when you try to sell it\nAnd the the options to you are somewhat limited some viewers will allow you to do a consignment where four percent they will consigned the jewelry for you the diamond in the jewelry for you but it is a a\nA situation where you will suffer a meaningful loss\nIn this case with ten thousand dollars on the line in the thousands of dollars\nSure because there's such a difference between the retail sale of a diamond jewelry and trying to sell it and the secondary market\nIs their benefit the hanging onto this even for a few years I'm with\nYou mean in terms of the Oreo diamonds appreciating or whatever that is that is so hard to call if they would be enough of an increase in value and a historical trends would say maybe not\n'cause remember you are not going to get near retail for it and I don't know I mean I ask you a difficult question now do you think that diamond as a loose diamond you would ever be comfortable giving it to another woman", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "10"}
