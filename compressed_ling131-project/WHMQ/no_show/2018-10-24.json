Shaun from food energy to my knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea but see ... basin as a region while we're exploring list\nThe uh foreign affairs matter that's on the television right now constantly is the caravan coming from Central America if Donald Trump didn't inventive\nI'm beginning to think that the that haven't has gone Republican that there's that that that this is the reds running for out across the whole holy ...\nBecause it is everything he talked about in the twenty sixteen campaign that took the Republican Party by storm and overwhelmed his rivals\nHis response was a strong border and wall\nThe caravan is a puzzle to me why there where it's coming the men look very healthy very well dressed dominant female of working age and they are marching through Mexico not seeking refuge in Mexico which offers to them asylum if they're\nFearful of conditions in their own countries Honduras Guatemala or El Salvador and they're marching toward the border Donald Trump doesn't have any have to do anything more than stand there and say witness I Will stop this\nYeah honestly I think that's true because I think every American should be offended by the goal of these people who are marching towards the United states who know filled well ah that they are breaking all kinds of laws that they try to come into the United states but just assuming that we are\nIn effect unable to stop the flow we have no\nPolicies in place to really prevent them from coming into the country and I have to say if there is one issue where Congress has utterly failed the American people this is it and for Donald Trump to his latched onto this in two thousand sixteen was a master stroke\nNot because he wants it to be a problem but because it is a problem and it needs to be fixed and by the way this is a very good time for Republicans to remind people that Trump made a proposal as you remember he had a several steps\nProposal on the table or to take care of the dreamers to redo our diversity lottery program\nVarious other things increase the border security et cetera which most Americans agreed with almost every segment of it uh in terms of polling response showed that people\nYes I think that people should be allowed to come into the country if they can provide for themselves so that we shouldn't be a ... you know care less if you will with opening our borders so this is something where he really is on the high ground up the Democrats if you recall wouldn't even talk about it in fact they just\nDidn't show with a meeting that was supposed to address immigration reform\nThey don't want immigration reform and I think\nHispanics are beginning to get the picture that this is something where they are being used as a political football or it has nothing to do with the morality of the situation Democrats simply like having this issue because they think\nRepublicans get hung out to dry on it but guess what this caravan as you well point out has really thrown that calculation overboard a it has been stirred up an organized by left wing agitator in Central America it's being funded by those\nPoliticians and activists\nAnd it is it has a very single sole purpose which is to embarrass the United states uh you know what it is embarrassing to the United states but not in the way they had hoped it's really embarrassing to Congress and a lack of laws and the Democrats who basically blink and pretend nothing bad it's happening\nThis should not be allowed and by the way it's not the first time when an American president was busted\nBy one of these assaults on our border we all remember a ... in a two thousand twelve I think it was when you had that surge across the border during Obama's presidency and Americans were horrified\nAnd all of a sudden all the polling on immigration reform went very hard nosed and sort of back fired for President Obama because people held him accountable for not fixing it uh I think this as a as you say a godsend for Republicans\nAlthough it really is not a godsend to anyone 'cause it's shameful\nFixing it uh I think this is that as you say a godsend to Republicans although it really is not a godsend to anyone 'cause it's a shameful uh it it sort of you know evidence of the fact that we pretend to be a rule of law nation but in this one instance we are not\nTaken the breath out of the Democratic tactic locally to talk healthcare healthcare healthcare the battleground poll for the sixty six districts I'm told this is Wall Street journal NBC\nIs now even if not favoring the Republicans as opposed to the national generic where the over vote ways and and that gives the advantage to the Democrats but we're only talking about the districts that are read for now but went from Mrs Clinton those are the sixty six battleground the Senate Liz\nThat caravan definitely is going to influence the Texas Senate race the Arizona Senate race in Nevada Senate race\nThe Montana Senate race and the Missouri Senate race in the Tennessee Senate race all of those states struggle with illegal immigrants and the lack of my ... immigration reform and all of those states were at issue for the Democrats while they're hold or pick up and they're now moving away from the Democrats\n[noise] yeah I think that's an I totally agree with you or I think that if somebody is definitely favoring\nRepublican candidates and by the way it's not all are Democrats who are trying to hold on to seats we had a very tight race surprisingly in Texas with Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke so there are some contests where this has got to have an impact\nI'm from ... in favor of Republicans who are trying to hold onto their seats and by the way it follows on the heels of the cabinet right disgrace which also\nA favorite Republican senators because Democrats really cut a torch their opportunity to show a reasonable list that I think American voters would appreciate\nA by failing to vote for a for cabinet or so they've had kind of two black guys here in a row uh and you know I think going out asking Americans to vote for you when you're\n... you know you're kind of\nUm [noise] not standing up for the things that most Americans think are important I think that's a pretty tough ask and I think they're going to find that on on November ...\nPeak for the columnist for the hill and for Fox News this segment of the global business report brought to you by the Republicans ... from food to energy to a knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in this region well worth exploring I'm John bachelor\nMm\nTo handle a piece of paper that that that is meant to hold them accountability replace handcuffs on\nThere is no there is no time limit on the charge and anyone can use it against Saudi Arabia there is a step down I Wonder if it satisfies because what you're describing though legally accurate sounds farfetched given the tangled in the middle east the global Magnitsky\nAct is that a is that a substitute that could be acceptable here\n[noise] well that is what we have going on right now Congress has invoked this law\nWhich allows them to force the administration to consider sanctions against Israel's responsible for gross human violation\nRights violations was that basically amounts to if it's ... enacted if it's implemented is that all of these officials will be barred from traveling to the United states and have any assets that they have in the United states frozen now if you're the you know sub number three in the Saudi you know hit team\nThen chances are that doesn't affect you at all because you're not going to come to the United states anyway and you probably don't have big bank accounts or investments in the United states if you met ... Mohammed bin ...\nSolomon rather well that's a very big deal or so the question really will be whether the Magnitsky Act sanctions or apply to just the people on the ground who actually did the killing or are they applied to the people who\nGave the order and who those people are will be crucial to\nJosh ... because the leaders of nations give orders that lead to death routinely by their gunman by their by their um operators by their military\nIs there a distinction here that is a available to the crown prince or to Riyadh to solve this in some legal fashion could they declare car show G to have been an enemy actor or illegal\nIn some legal fashion could they declare car show G to have been a an enemy actor or an illegal combatant that this is twisted several administrations here ever since the war on terror started\nYou know well the fact of the crown prince is also the de facto head of the military\nMeans that he has quote unquote command responsibility which means that even the act performed by the forces under his control whether or not he had premeditated knowledge he's responsible for those that right now you can get could he\nStrike some sort of deal whereby he was exonerated that's always possible but under the law if implemented a to the letter or he's as guilty as the person who will do also\nIsn't that true for any leader of state if it leads to a a death I'm thinking of the the debates we've had about drone strikes in the middle east these last Eighteen years is this different than a drone strike that goes awry and lead to the death of an innocent\nThere are different rules for what happens in a war zone it declared a conflict now John strikes perpetrated by the United states is not always been in those words no they haven't\nYet there's ... there's a there's a case to be made and often the only difference between war crimes that get prosecuted and war crimes that go unanswered is the will of the international human rights community to select a particular case based on the fact that it's particularly egregious or violates a norm that the international community hope fear\nThat's why you see prosecutions for chemical weapons even though they are relatively uh you know the killing less people then carpet bomb I Know in the case of ... violates a couple of norms right one of a you know the ... the ability of a free press to operate in a free society to the killing of a U.S resident\nWas three us for US citizen children in in ... in a NATO country\nYou know that is what makes this case new and different and interesting and where's the of the attention of some of these uh uh particularly uh uh extravagant\nBut legal and justice and accountability measures now that doesn't mean that that's going to happen but to be strict about it yes you can prosecute every\nWar crime in every crime against humanity all the way up to the top and you would be ... within the law is\nJosh broken for global opinions for

he teaches law at NYU and the University of Chicago we hear\nAbout the Jackie go for profit talking about living creature that doesn't have a happy\nHabitat in Mississippi where it's named and what has been profiting for many hundreds of thousands of years but right now the fish and Wildlife Service if I found Fifteen hundred and forty four privately held out ... acres in Louisiana which is kind of next door and they have designated those acres though there are privately held\nHabitat what does that mean what is the power of habitat and Richard I go to the all the arguments\nYou preview this by saying Justice Kagan introduced the hypothetical of landowners and the designation of critical habitat\nAnd she asked whether uh just making a slight improvement that's the quote you get a would be adequate Justice Roberts on the other hand\nUm it I read this mocking lady asks the question can you build a giant greenhouse implant long leaf pine in Alaska and call that a habitat now both seem to be making fun of fish and Wildlife Service Sarah\nHave I have I misunderstood the sobriety at the court\nI mean what they were all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the key statutory term that is the Supreme Court when it took this case was not interested in for his principles there is a statute which says that the fish and Wildlife Service\nCan designate essential critical habitat up observations purposes and the actual disputed in the court was a semantic one is what does it mean to be essential\nAnd what Justice Kagan hypothetical was designed to establish is that you can have an essential habitat which is not currently occupy by any members of the species\nThat is in some sense we're done because the statute actually anticipates that that does have procedures for an occupied habitat the chief justice coming at this from the other end says this term\nAre essential makeup of some cases but it's not infinitely elastic and certainly would not say that habitat\nIs going to be essential if you pick some random part of the forest up there in Alaska decide the cover it up with some kind of a dome and then put some pine trees and it and do it you could not designate that land and the answer that Justice Kagan would give is we was found a frog of this particular sort of this area so\nWe are closer to the situation of not being an arbitrary selection\nWhich is true I don't think you could say this was all betray capricious but what it is is it's highly remote and so the question then becomes is\nHow essential is essential is the question they're debating and he would never have to debate this question if the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service if you want to designate this land is habitat condemn at which point you can do\nBake this question if the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service if you want to designate this land is habitat condemn it\nAt which point you can do whatever you want with it includes some of it off but the sweet home case that you referred to was bad but\nSaid essentially when the government does engaging in habitat designation\nIs prevent the animals from being harmed by the destruction of habitat and that is something which they can do as of right under the statute which says you're not allowed to take endangered species and the terms of listed there oh you're not allowed to capture you're not allowed to\nReduce you're not allowed to hunter not allowed to slaughter one form or another and then the issue is whether or not the word home which is kind of defuse covers habitat destruction as opposed to something that's not listed on that list like poisoning an animal and there was a\nBig argument about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient to designate a habitat than it is to buy it and who am I to tell them given the deficit is that we give to administrative agencies that there is wrong\nSo habitat or preservation is now essentially a regarded as an anti harm measure rather than as a provision\nThat but at that ... that means the government doesn't even have to deal with the controversy of taking any more you can just designate something like Central Park habitat and nothing will ever happened to it you don't have a ...\nAnd well the question is do you make the essential test and if you read essential narrowly than they can't succeed because it's not critical because it's not as central to centrally broadly you can do it the takings problem just eliminates that problem because you know you want to take it didn't take it whether it's essential and I just figured out\nDo you have to do you have to compensate if you'd takings as opposed to have that yes yes you do so because the fish and Wildlife Service money if they said take money\nToday for gains tomorrow what they do when governments typically condemn property for sites they sell part of it off in order to recoup part right right\nNo because what happened the way the Supreme Court works is once a president is decided I'm In the course of oral arguments you're not allowed to reopen that particular point so the only thing they could do is to look at a dictionary and similar sources most of them when they use the word essential\nAre talking about indispensable viable without which something can't worry going to the core of the essence of things\nAnd I would think as a straight linguistic matter a future use of property which is going to require future payments\nWhich are not yet made which may never happen could hardly be regarded as essential but Justice Kagan is trying to say look I get these guys that for instance if I give these guys deference\nThey know more about the environment than we do we know they did this extremely careful study which they didn't do\nIt was exactly this study would want to do if you're going to condemn the land the differences if you can buy if a zero as you can with designation you'll take it but if you have to pay thirty four million dollars is not a very likely chance that they would put their money up for that so at the\nTakings clause is designed to do is to establish a market as against the government\nUh which will reduce its appetite and as I keep stressing when you teach this or you talk about it is the greatest importance of the takings clause is not that it gives compensation when property is taken which is nice the really important thing is you put a price up there\nAnd all of a sudden some hair brains games with some dubious games are not worth the price that you have to have so you don't do it there was a famous case called Lucas in which the government designated certain land\nUm as being essential to keep it empty even though it was with five hundred thousand dollars and Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying if you would designate there so it can't be used for anything it's\nTaking what the government was then required to do is to buy the land pay Mr Lucas five hundred thousand dollars now and it's titled the land which cost at five hundred thousand dollars and what do you think they promptly did\nThey sold because it wasn't worth five hundred thousand dollars to\nA neighbor offered them to pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I said where am I going to get the rest of the money for this so essentially what they did is they put it up to auction and that's what it is if you actually have to take possession of the property you don't want that\nWhat you do as you say it might be better off selling off this thing and taking the money and using it for real habitat preservation or doing preservation or do I want to keep the Suzanne\nOut Richard you introduce the possibility of wiggle room here when the court decides this if it turns on the word essential how can they fish and Wildlife Service make a rational argument that inventing something in Louisiana that might in fifty years satisfy the dust could go for fraud is essential habitat how do they make that\nWhat the argument they make their money multiple reasons to return and essential as far as that concern means appropriate for conducive\nTo an edited ministry that has the first right to interpret the statute so this gets back to the famous chef ... ... and if you regard the term is ambiguous you give a nod to the agency I Do not regard this term is ambiguous\nUh but what essentially happens is the liberal wing of the court is much more willing to regard terms is ambiguous and the conservative turn\nJustice Kavanaugh was not present on the bench when this case was argued so it's quite possible to go for for which point that would be argued and I think one of the things that's likely to happen as you get a consistent I'm intellectually conservative majority\nIs that they are going to be less willing to sort of find ambiguities which allow administrators the discretion I think this is a pretty good case I have never seen the word essentially used in the way in which it was used by the court boy which says\nIt doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter how much it costs it's essential that the government thinks that it's essential\nAnd so the statutory constraints is read out and I don't think that this particular\nCourt will tolerate this how it is that the fall liberal judges will go I don't know nobody quite knows the basic opinion after the ... the oral argument took place is that it can go any which way\nThey have indeed be really if you go for a frog can jump any which way Richard abstain we will return to that's why he kept the decision and in the spring Richard Epstein of the Hoover Institution and the ... go for a frog formerly of Mississippi I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show [noise]\n\nGoing H Pam [noise]\nOpportunity or the storm has weakened any indication of opportunity\nStalls pretty much gone at this point uh but there is no word from EPA to detail listening on a regular basis we're still not into the dust storms seasonal November and their theory is that uh the even though they they they can communicate with the rover the rover has\nIt's probably got it's solar panels cup of dust from the storm and therefore can't get enough power and Ryan need is a dust devils to clean it off and the dust devils season doesn't start until November\nAnd so we were really waiting that's if they're going to keep listening but they're they're not expecting anything to significantly change or until at least know\nThem they're a timeline that runs on an opportunity we count and your January\nThat's what they said that they might listen a little longer than that but they basically they they think that if they haven't heard anything by January it means that that that they never it was never able to get enough power to come back to life and so\nI wouldn't completely dismiss the possibility because it any time if the dust devils finally arrives and clears off the rover might send a signal back\nBut at the moment that's going to be that's the deadline they're looking at they will stop looking very hard after January\n... to no problems with the main base crap but ah they're looking for a landing site what's the status Bob\nWhat is this deal is this they've done a full survey or were you grew and it's a very it's above the surface they had hoped to see a flap spot about fifty meters a hundred and fifty feet across and they and they've only found one place that's about twenty meat is sixty feet across\nAnd the problem is that the ... the space craft doesn't really have the capability\nPrecision capability they planned to have the capability of hitting such a small spot it's the only place they can land\nAnd so they had decided to do the lay the landing till January what they could they did in October and they've done at least one or Herschel they have not yet on the second martial but they're they're going to do or tour Russell's in October they've done one and then the sun moves between us and higher Bruce or in November and December\nWe moved to a success for acute ... what is your ... bomb and what's the success\n[noise] All right well that's our tiny a standardized a square satellites you can hold one in the palm of your hand I think they're like a\nFour centimeters across to centimeters I mean this is matrix metrics or I'm not that good with it but you can hold them in the palm of your hand they were designed initially for students to teach students how to make a satellites but they have this technology has gotten sophisticated enough that you see Cuba's have launched for all kinds of real purpose is not just\nA teaching and so when they launched the insight Mars lander earlier this year to them to Mars um they also launched waited to secondary cube SATs called Marco\nThere's two of them ... to and these cube SATs are basically do a flyby of Mars and they're going to be used kind of as a communication ... satellite while in such\nInsight is going down to land but also a technology experiment to see if cube SATs can be used to interplanetary missions and here's the success one of the two Marcos cube SATs this week successfully took the first interplanetary picture by huge ad and they got a picture of laws\nNow it's not a spectacular image mosques just looks like a little red dot but with ... this is they were able to point this cube set accurately\nThey've been able to have it has solar panels to maintain power in interplanetary space that's\nUnusual and so this is telling us that we're going to shift and I think in interplanetary travel from a a big expensive and rarely launched space craft liking set insight and light curiosity to small very inexpensive cube SATs\nThat you can launch frequently and in large numbers to do a lot of different things and so this is a this is a groundbreaking a a technological success John\nAnd ... because they're cheap by that means that interplanetary Donny can be done by private institutions private individuals there were no longer depending upon big space to deliver a good sign\nYes it's very possible and I think we're going to talk about this later on in the second segment but it's been going to be very possible for private companies to build small cube SATs at a reasonable cost and sell the at fault interplanetary travel and send sell that capability to ... countries scientists you know the whole world\nA research scientist with say a good plot for the discovery of the end of the world now we go to another stick says this is the launch of a mercury mission we've had very few mercury mission the last one I remember\nA gave us the possibility of water rights at the polls because it's perpetually blocked by the ... what does this mission\nAll right well this the first mission was messed that first mission was America I think ... ten ... flew by mercury and the second one was American a mission messenger that orbited mercury that's the one\nThat's found as you said John possible ah perpetually dark craters that might have water in them um this mission is a joint Japanese Europe\nIt's found as you said John possible uh perpetually dark craters that might have water in them um this mission is a joint Japanese European mission it's called the ... the whole mission is called ... Colombo in honor of it out to Italian\nI'm a famous scientist and explore um but the mission is actually two different orbiters around mercury that Japan or but it is going to be studying the magnetosphere of mercury and the European orbiter is going to be looking at the planet itself\nAnd then they'll be carry together on a transport module 'em\nAnd they can have slightly different orbits or they'll see different things when they're there and they're going to take seven years to get that was launched by an area on five rocket ah this past weekend successfully and so at seven years they've got to both move into orbit about mercury and look at it that much but a look at it\nOh this cool Bob they're gonna fly by the earth and twenty twenty fly by Venus and twenty twenty and do Venus again and twenty Twenty one so they're using that gravity effect right they like yes court\nYes in fact getting to mark here is not easy and it's a and so they and this is much like the ... probe getting into the sun and the low orbits is not necessarily easy and so using the slingshot flyby met that\nThis is something that scientists have that engineers have really developed a very sophisticated mad at the last decade or so to do go almost anywhere and this also allows you to do it with smaller rockets because you don't need as much energy um when you launch you take get that energy from the gravity of the planet you fly by\nBob's everyone keeps the website behind the black\nWe're headed to the moon maybe I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

H. here in the morning news with Bob clarity and Denise Cosell and\n[noise] you know semi method for actually watching the world series started\nThink what the Houston series in the ... and uh yeah I bum I watch it you know my usual I I've done this during the regular season to where I somehow torture myself and I\nWill watch a few innings here and there I'm always doing stuff to put her run around yes I'd put her to get anything done nothing done whatsoever\nBut I Do I buy ... excellent part of her and uh so are you are yeah you're kind of watching the winnings and then they're going to go bad because I got to get up with a metal last night and so but what I did a started with the Houston series and it doesn't seem to really bother him read too much\nAre your have the TV on in the bedroom which is a rare thing I mean we do not watch TV in the bedroom very often or you know we're not\nI mean I remember those ... days where people said that they would do watch Johnny Carson all night in their bedroom and we've never done that anything like that but ah in this case where we are our art but the TV on in the bedroom and I turned the sound of what they are and so then I go to bed and now are kind of pop up in for some reason I kind of wake up I mean 'cause I I\nI wouldn't call it what I Do anyway a fitful sleep [laughter] fits fitbit sitting there you are married fits the star to that's what that's how I sleep anyway\nBut does so if for some reason I was waking up at the most opportune times the other night when they look clinch when they got into the world series against a Houston or you know all my classes on so I don't see I don't see very well with the glasses on to tell you the truth but that's another\nIt got into the world series against a Houston or you know they're all my classes on so I don't see I don't see very well with the glasses on it's all you the truth but that's another story but uh anyway so I Would wake up at like I wake up and somebody had a key hit I couldn't tell who it was but I could sort of tell\nA but then the other night to a ... D a socks closure\nRelief pitcher or with the gigantic Rutherford behaves beard and a ... so I woke up the other night and without the glass and everything I could tell it was kimbrell which means it's the ninth inning which means that okay I Want to get up and put on the class of ... and\nSo I Do that as shuttles are last night and Eduardo Munoz who came in to pinch hit\nA car's doing a very good job with the platoon anything except they do those news broad cold the hottest hitter on the team\nI don't understand there's always some kind of a nitpicky things that you can pick on with shocks management there's always has to be something and that that's my thing right there the doesn't use the the hottest hitter rock hold has been the hottest hitter for like three months uh doesn't really\nUse him to any great effects or maybe he started tonight on all\nThey do going with that left right thing that they the old cliche where or if you are right handed pitcher to the left handed batter has it easier chance to hit\nAgainst you the best thing is no longer a thing but they still use it's an old baseball adding um so what are you gonna axiom I should say\nBut ah so anyway I woke up just to sit ... who's now with the ... I Can't really tell I think I might be new news okay and I put it on the glasses and the ... part of my glasses he hits the home run which was this one of these long dry seven iron shots\nInto the screen is always great where you can when you can reach the screen with that type of swing you're not even taking the\nWhat they what are they make up this thing about the the launch angle now I don't know if you get paid much attention to baseball you've heard about this nonsense about the launch angle\nThis is just to cover up its its to pretend that they're not using performance enhancing drugs and they're\nNot using the juice baseball's the juice baseball's reproduces all the home runs but they um they like to pretend that it's something else so [laughter] so that's what they do now with the launch angle okay as I've said many times have you actually did\nTry to use an upper cut it to hit the ball out of the park you hit a pop up every time it was interesting is launching a cover but a voter so uh to uh when you hit a line drawn or like I knew what a new uses a strict line drive hitter than he does not use the launch I was not try to go deep\nAnd he gets that long drive to just carry ... it's a beautiful thing when someone can reach the screen was such a swing so I\nI saw the Arctic that's kind of cool that makes me feel better another headache for I kinda went back to sleep a little bit and I ... and there are there's Kimball again I recognize the beer the areas again so I was waking up at these great ... so I had it was almost like I was doing this the the highlights of other people actually do this\nThey uh instead of watching the game itself to watch the highlights the next day\nSo it's almost like I Do I'm like the human highlights reel was where I Am because I I Do it right in ... you know in real time I'm doing a highlight field in real time so\nI wouldn't advise any of this you know because I'm ... I'm probably gonna not off like no no that's not me about anyway so\nAnyway game one of the world series the the Red Sox take the first game and I kind of had a feeling I was saying as yesterday I hate to be perfect but I I was a ... as soon as yesterday that the stuff that Clinton cursed Shaw the ace of their staff or throws at you\nThese are the kind of pitchers that um the red Sox usually can solve by the second time through the batting order\nOr he does that crazy hurt the jerky motion and he raises his leg and then brings us like down in the bridges like back up again\nI'll just the timing thing just to screw up your time he he doesn't throw overpowering stuff anyways I kinda figured there ... hours a little bit over rated in the end of the Sox would get 'em and then they certainly did so ah anyway of course are crusty old unfair much better sense yes so\nAnyway good game day one goes to the red Sox high school sports with Scott going coming up in sixty\nNine ... with your money now or to answer event is Asian operations and made U.S China business a stand alone units recruiting the head of local automatically cherry automobile can be it's new CEO industry veteran Ken awning will replace chasing the lab who quit earlier this year just months after taking over at forty in China\nAnd the automaker has been reorganizing after losing momentum as the Chinese market flows it says the restructuring aimed at accelerating its return to profitable growth\nAnd never energy resources is exploring a sale that could die of the big private Texas oil Frank or at more than ten billion dollars the wall Street Journal says shit a transaction occur it would be the biggest in a wave of recent deals focused on the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico the engine of crude production growth in recent years\nAnd twenty sixteen it was close with a law that the governor signed and so we've now extending those protections on the basis of gender identity but there are many people there's a fringe group I Would say in the states that wants to roll those rights back\nAlways strange to me when you have people who are so obsessed with rolling back the civil rights of of their fellow citizens and so they put this on the ballot again it's written in a funny way but if you want to preserve the these rights the worst Alison Massachusetts you should vote yes on this question\nThe of course the the big thing coming up in November is taking back the house the city the net earns a lot of people with a little bit optimistic about this and there's some national races that look awfully close right now what is your assessment on this that the chance to actually take\nBack the house you know I I don't just be honest with you when it comes to national politics I I I don't know [laughter]\nAh you know I'm I I work on local stuff and I'm interested in state things when we get up to Congress you know your guess is as good as mine I what I understand from listening to people is that they feel pretty optimistic about it I think you know maybe people even feel they have an outside chance to uh the Democrats will even outside chance to take the Senate\nWhich is of course a significant I think historically the the first myth terms after the president's first term the other party sort of comes roaring back of his though I think that's happened to almost all the time most all the time so the odds are against the historically so that would lend credence the idea that it may happen this time\nI certainly think people are energized ... I Know the Democrats are raising lots more money than Republicans and I think it's because of that and Suzie ask them to change things\nUm the charter review committee that are concerning the Northampton city council this is interesting yeah every every ten years we our church hires like the constitution for the city lays out how the government works you know\nUm how the mayors elected how many city councilor is you have their terms everything every ten years we review it and potentially have asked for a new one the legislature grants these things\nWe set up a citizen commission or to make recommendations and and offers suggestions um and so the council voted for the the second and final time to create this committee\nUm I Will have one appointment as council president the mayor will point people from each ward and the city ... there'll be some other form of sue and then the committee will begin to meet next year\nAnd it will deliberate and we'll talk about what kind of government we want to have in Northampton I can think of things that I Would change yeah right off the bat yeah I mean you know I remember when I was elected as large a special election action which actually two elections so we had a run off\nUm I think we could save the city a lot of money if we looked into rank choice voting for ... yeah that's getting a lot of traction you know um why do we vote on Tuesday our charter says we have to vote on Tuesday I I don't see why that has to be the case in every every situation maybe we can give some way to the clerk to to change that\nAnd ultimately the our structure of government effects that the policies that come out of it\nWas covered the charter that was one of those two or three years now to\nWell let me think I guess it went to affect maybe in twenty twelve\n'cause that was the one that uh basically now made the may ... term of yeah rather than\nYou wouldn't roll that back back or anything that I wouldn't be as suppose it could be you know\nYou know I I have a wacky idea I think the council president should be an elected position by the voters of the city you know oh I've uh I've I've just come to that in some other cities do that you know city of Baltimore does that at Georgia Atlanta Georgia does that make Washington DC does that interesting idea because\nThen you're accountable to the people of the city and they sort of a chance to weigh in on the legislative direction of of Northampton they have a chance to weigh in on who heads the executive branch the mayor but what about the alleged flavor so anyway that's my wacky idea\nA I'm not sure anyone would support that or if I push it very hard but yes all those things are up for discussion\nOn our ... are you being challenged there is there anybody on the council that has indicated that they may run against you\nWhich generally are elections are for every two years the election for council president it wouldn't be until uh twenty twenty well do a lot of damage between there you go I'll get complacent yeah Ronald Donald's with is the president of the north haven city council\nWell let's take a break here and I want to talk a little bit about the the

a plastic bags which briefing five counts or Tim Dolan doesn't believe it was a strong argument against the ban Oregon\nI understand that people use these bags and that's great using a bag twice is only marginally better than using a back once you're still throwing it away it's still entering the waste stream even if you use it for cat litter there are other solutions you can put your cat litter and a paper bag which will buy or degrade\nThe council expected to reconsider the ordinance that its next meeting in November and my guess is it'll get to send them votes it needs to pass this time

see um do a three hundred thousand people were apprehended in the southern border last year a fourteen toasts three hundred thousand or from the ban countries that we just mentioned\nOr the department of homeland security has had a two thousand five hundred counters with people in on the terrorist watch list almost all of these people were trying to enter the country by air by airplane right only

the that there's this uh that's been going on for centuries\nThis a communist octopus\nWas taking over these countries like Guatemala was actually the U.S a fruit company that ah controls the land and

like Trump or a pretends that it's something else going on here [laughter] it's just kind of happened so uh anyway\nUm the um\nI was listening to the Trump apologist a which is something that I I

UMass Amherst labor center and I don't know what that is exactly so it's really a two part question but tell us what I'd like to really get to the substance of my question but also like to know why\nIn every listeners know while you two are the experts on this topic Cedric whatsoever with you and then we're going to go to ...\nYou know I Would say on the on the Sears peace right that\nYes the minute I think the decline of Sears speaks to a moment and uh American and also global economic history in which basically corporate America has abandon\nThe idea of a stakeholder economy uh when\nUh CEOs and uh and workers a share 'em in the prosperity\nOr that they are collectively produce right and as the as that article on the front page in the New York times or just you know the new retail giant Amazon is you know much less given to um helping workers out\nSo I think that you're not overstating it build the only thing that I Would add is that you know Sears didn't do that you know because they were super generous they did that because they they were a company that emerged at a time when workers had a ton of collective power\nRight and so workers through the labor movement pressured employers like seers right or into a into bargaining a living wage um\nUh and good benefits and pensions um and that created a tank and organizational culture at places like seers right where you know there was an understanding that we're not we're going to not take all of this for ourselves but we're going to give some of it um [noise] uh to uh to the workers at as well\nAnd better this year's lineup of twenty Eighteen shoveling trucks is no exception whether you're looking for a regular double a coup Ken you'll find that if Bush of away with a wide choice of options interim package his hand with ... in the book discounts you can save thousands on your new truck\nWork trucks the high country models because their Chevy Truck for everyone saw him in the book Chevrolet areas truck experts north king street next to the ... camp to wire lease get your best deal today and Bush shoveling\nYou never know what did he acts in these new American money for the bombing that Enron fresh in my bloodstream is everyone dances rather him\nComing shows like our own media team Julian line Todd Snyder nice pairing telling talking and the kid ...\nParking free team I'm having a sense they say the the\nParking three Fifteen minute I'm having a dense\nCity Hi I'm Stephanie Miller sons Heather brave I think that was what it's gonna be down your film you're feeling sorry for the phone has been talented I don't want to get flour a\nDollar for dollar bottle can govern uh filing Charlie they discovered a on a very full thirty dollar appointment of event for ... years here if I said oh no I don't know about\nSeventy dollars which is just one on one by one over seven five nobody\nAsia and be [noise]\nWe're complete conduct rules for WHM please visit W.

on one by one over the summer and fall page and be\nFilming WHM we continue our conversation was Cedric day we own and Julie closure they\nAre respectively the director of the new director of the human is labor center and Julie is the academics program manager for the U.S labor center\nI Would appreciate if you could tell our listeners what are the biggest fights regarding employees labor and the community in your view that are now going on UMass Amherst\nUm yeah I think that um with Cedric coming on board and and being the first um leader of color to be or is it the first person of color to be leading the labor center\nI'm and I'm coming from a background um I went to the University of Michigan also um and met there on a someone who became a mentor of mine gracefully bugs\nWho was fighting for labor rights I'm back in the forties and fifties and then kind of transitioned into\nFighting for um racial justice and in particular in Detroit the black power movement and so I Lived with her and two thousand eight and I'm definitely carry that into I'm looking at how\nEconomic justice is just one aspect of the fights that ... that labor center wants to be looking at we also are thinking a lot about gender equity and racial justice and for instance on campus and we've had a couple um racist incidences occur recently that has been in the news um and\nWe're looking to um\nPartner with folks on campus like the afro am department the w._b. the boys African American um\nStudies department and the W ... center which is part of the library as well as um\nSee mass which does multi cultural education programming on campus and they've been since twenty twelve getting together a coalition of students I'm faculty and staff that are responding to institutional racism that very much exist on that campus and saying how can we\nRaise awareness about um the fights that\nFolks of color experience every day or you know that um the flights and and the difficulties they they shut down a whole building for um\nFor thirty minutes because of the racial profiling incident on campus and do raising awareness about that but also saying what do we do to change that climate and to change that culture of white supremacy that really still does exist\nWhat is the connection in a ... so do the new director the UMass Amherst flavors interviewed\nConnect the dots for ... you are labor organizers you or focus on the rights of employees and workers and people who are uh exploited disenfranchised and various ways the relationship between that kind of collective effort\nIs for workers and racism on campus I don't think that's necessarily a self evident a connection so could you help us understand that\nYeah sure um you know one thing that we try to teach at the labor center is that the struggle for worker rights is inseparable from the struggle for the rights of women\nAnd the people of color another marginalized um folks um so let's just take for example the you know the incident at a win more which is the administration building at UMass Amherst\nHere was a a union member a worker of color who walked into his own workplace okay and campus security shut the place down and interrogated this person okay that ... in my view and I think in most people's views\nIs a hostile work environment how's that person supposed to be productive how's that person supposed to trust the folks that are that he or she works with a in order to get the job done that they were hired to do\nThat as a very clear example in my view right that the that the rights of workers and the civil rights that person as a person of color are connected right you can't separate those two we think for example also about sexual harassment right\nThat ... just in the nature of disclosures since I Am the drugs to western Massachusetts off to the American civil liberties union and it is a public records or do we have made it public records requests of the universities to times saying making the public records demand for all the information around that incident no please no it's great and and so and if we think\nAlso about um you know the the um the issue the issues that that women face on a daily basis in the workplace of being the target of sexual\nHarassment continually right\nI mean how are women supposed to work under those conditions that too right it's a hostile work environment that is not only a worker rights issue it's also a women's rights issue and so what we try to do with the labor center is advance of vision of union solidarity that includes not just\nYou know kind of bread and butter you know worker rights issues right but also folds in the fact that you know there are workplace issues that have to deal with gender and race and the fact of the matter is you know we were talking earlier about the transition from industrial workforce to a surface workforce the workforce\nIn the United states today right is more feminine eyes and more diverse than it is ever been and if the labor movement is going to rise from the ashes is going to have to understand that we have to see racial class and gender inequality as linked that\nHas to be the core of our struggle and so what we do what the labor centers we try to educate our students on the on how those struggles are linked to one thing that I hold her screaming will do for us uh in the coming semesters is teach a class a we've been discussing on employment rights that links you know workplace issues too\n... is teach a class that we've been discussing on employment rights that links you know workplace issues to questions of civil rights and employment discrimination like that's the kind of stuff that we do at the labor sent if only Harris Freeman we're here to be able to do that [laughter]\nOkay Harris room and just walking Harris the microphone is yours will even give you the last word on a segment Ira dresser Harris Harris ring they'll they'll say\nThank you for having that this kind of show it it's really great to\nHave a conversation with my colleagues in others about uh the intersection of of justice for working people and and justice for women and and diverse minorities are in the United states it it it is the future of the labor movement and um and when you say the\nFuture of the labor movement or are you a including a into these other than unions or is this strictly a union a base struggle in your view\nWell I think that that that the labor movement a is an organization that seeks to speak for not only those that are currently organized but those that need organization and need reform in laws to protect them even if they're not in a union we want to stand for all those people\nAre so for example one one local thing that the labor center is involved in as a a friend of the court who filed a brief with the Supreme judicial court about a current struggle here in the valley\nOf low wage workers a working uh in the food sector who have been denied overtime pay for packing bean sprouts in a giant indoor facility or the labor center just filed a brief with the Supreme judicial court that uh that I wrote and build roads together\nLeaving the impression certainly among a significant swath of America that the United states government is completely out of touch and unable to be of assistance to the people of Puerto Rico and I'm Wondering whether that is a correct analysis in your judgment\nThat that's just the picture is that says I'm a lot about what was happening uh I mean we have been\nLost I'm In the discussions in the United states and the executive a branch of the United states have have not only on the Trump presidency but um before that\nHave not had like the ... the agenda\nI I think the the whole issue of Trump selling paper towels of people are there are people um was one more insult on top of many others\nUm you can also point out to all of the different tweets famous tweets of I'm President Trump against the vehicle and um the managing the effects of Hurricane Maria\nBut also talking about um how ... was also a in his view the ... the main cos I mean it was a political ... does he go it was ... the ones to be blamed for the effects of the Hua taking\n'em and and that is it's not just ignorant but it's also a discriminatory statement um I mean put the recall has been the territory of colony of the United states for more than a century now um\nWe don't have a democratic elected government a decision starting posting us by the U.S Congress and the most recent one was the imposition of a fiscal control board that make decisions are on our behalf\nAnd the physical control where we should point out was initiated under President Obama right\nI Would like you to go back to President Trump for a minute at least an answer this question for me if you would is President Trump viewed in Puerto Rico and I understand ... ... new journal question here over me ask you than specific more specifically do view what President Trump did is fundamentally racist\n[noise]\nThe short question is Detroit's answer is yes of course but um there is a complex more complex um answer to that and that is that what those are the ... the um [noise]\nA has been the target of what we call structurally discrimination so they're getting struck toured discrimination I'm so there's several aspects of a discriminatory levels and the treatment of the USDA ...\nI'm beginning with the colonial subjugation type of relationship that we have\nBut also on the um the older everyday aspects of making decisions on behalf of deacons so um this precedent I'll say is more expressive he has he's he's not hiding\nHis discriminatory um attitude toward ... ...\nIt's discriminatory I'm ... and that's not to say that I'm governments before Trump way not discriminatory against Bernie ...\nI'm ... but the fact that he is so open about it is just a very insulted is um and just a wrong\n[noise] uh we're speaking with attorney and the more tennis or a bona she's the director of the Institute for human rights and a professor of clinical law and human rights with the inter American University in Puerto Rico she was here in the valley giving a talk to the western New England University's School of war\nYou refer to Puerto Rico as a colony of the United states has been for the past century\nI Know this was a big question but I Would appreciate your perspective\nDo you think that the solution to the both political and economic problems and Tunisians face in Puerto Rico is independence or statehood or a continuation of its present status what would make life for Puerto Ricans better on the island\nYeah so I'm I'm not too uh another one to make a decision on behalf of Puerto Ricans right I I Do have my own views and on that question but I Would say is that um ... have never had the ... the right\nThere right to self determination um respected and that is something that is that the basis of of of um\nOf resolving the situation I'm right now there hasn't been a lot of discussion I and after ... as well on the status of ... second I'm caught citizens uh and and I have to say I\nI I don't agree with that because I Believe we are not necessarily\nA citizens of the United states so much as ... um subjects\nAre absolutely right before I'm a day is paying you know a power so what we have here if you talk about second class citizens we can get citizens in the U.S in the U.S content in the states\nSo I'm a person can have a citizenship that was imposed on us\nIt's it's different and and the discussion it to me is um alarming that I'm\nDiscussing the right to ... to be treated fairly to receive that the the protection that we need\nUm it's not necessarily because we are us citizens is because it is a real human rights and because the United states have a responsibility a fiscal responsibility\nOver trade tore that he has decided to um to have and um\nSo that's at the core of the situation we've\nJust about a minute left but I Would like\nTo ask you for your perspective on what should happen now with regard to a recovery efforts or continued recovery efforts or new recovery efforts to help Puerto Rico recover from the natural and unnatural disaster that has followed Hurricane Maria\nThere are many things that need to happen I'm the first thing I'll say is that um you know but um [noise] sending money over will not resolve the the question or the situation\nI'm Puerto Rico has many structural problems I think the relationship with the United states needs to ah get straight um and we need to resolve that relationship um as soon as possible and Puerto Rican needs to have\nThe respect their democratic uh\nI'm I'm right I'm as well as an economic and social rights I'm even if we say that um let's say that a FEMA\nA starts to do a great job I don't think that will make many different I'm In a situation right now I'm the first thing that the second thing that should happen is for the United states to assume\nA ... that we have Seventy two over Seventy two billion dollars in public debt and that didn't happen overnight\nIt happened because again of the limitations in our economy and posed by the U.S Congress and the United states\nSo there is a fiscal an international responsibility that the United states has over but the legal and they need to a sudden it\nWe've been speaking with us attorney in the mountain is horrible and she's the\nDirector of the Caribbean Institute for human rights clinical professor of law and human rights

right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors ... this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold dog I Want you to write me as grim for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to hearing my nails me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem more than anything else and we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kinda\nWhy the drug industry now puts more money into marketing to delve into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody demanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a a significant number\nTo make it defensible than justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that costs\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end to this practice because they see it as just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it matched what you and I can do is we can't change that momentum and we're not that powerful sorry\nChanged that momentum so we've got to go back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that al ...\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that well there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers\nAnd on all the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product\nGetting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big\nStep in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into more useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son when he he is one or watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that was gosh I Can't give parents you know what I find that to your son\nThe best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nThey have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't make those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nWith David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he did his family radio\nWhere I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any

your wife is not a laughing matter\nA good matter I mean we we were able to acquire or but unfortunately a those after my wife uh\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately yes those after my wife my wife's dad passed away\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss\nHello thank you\nSo how can I be of service and the situation\nThat cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance 'cause we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while the kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money\nWith where everything set out as far as our coverage so we're going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh\nOh I just have your wallet just take that and not even stab your wallet\nA lot 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was the one of the first thoughts along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising deductibles okay and try to raise those to a thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to\nOkay but that helps and we\nWere five hundred now so\nYeah so raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway\nBecause the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nAre our oldest vehicle as a ... for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay that's sticking to the other two are newer we have a two thousand Fifteen in to the car we just got to the two thousand at fourteen so\nYour teenager needs to be driving the oh for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the bar but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most time for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay uh you know it's something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with new drivers with teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rapes tend to be set in a state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle over there and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies the ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends that have gone down that path and it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific to us to help us\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what it's called the captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only riot for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat so independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\nWe own a controlled creating jobs and building our local economy October

how are you doing good thank you or your wife is retiring\nYes a sure returning from a large retailer and she found the option of taking the lump sum or monthly distribution for answering\nMy goodness she's retiring from a retailer and she has a pension\nYeah believe it or not last ones left\nWow you know there's almost no such thing as a as a retailer with a penchant for their workers\nYeah she'd been there for a thirty four years now wow\nHow can I be of service 'cause that's a shocking thing\nWe were just wondering what what America you know lump sum or taking a a month or distribution\nSo if we just look at the dollars and cents or without looking at her individual plan almost always and it's not a hundred percent of time but it's close it's better\nTo take the monthly payment from them than it is to take the lump sum but you since you told me it's a retailer you kinda knocked me back on my feet because that creates a different concern\nHow solid financially as this retail\nThat we don't we don't know all\nYou have real ends to doubt how viable they might be oh yeah\nIf you do that would mean that even though the odds are overwhelming there would be better for your wife to take a monthly check in this case she probably be better served taking the lump sum\nWhat about taxes amid a lump sum would that the fact that our current rate or whatever the extract in the lump sum be\nYes though is when you get a lump sum distribution you get clobbered on tax in\nThe year you receive it yeah that's the only reason I Do want to take as 'cause that was for the for the very top tax bracket\nSo here's the thing if you take the monthly check and she was there a long long time there is a cause I federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation so if at some point the company she worked for fails to cease to exist fails and they're done\nThe pension liability is turned over to this agency the pension benefit guarantee corporation and they have a formula based on how large your pension your wife would be receiving what kind of hair cut she'd get how much of her pension\nShe would actually have reduced that she would receive from them forward from this ... federal agency\nSo residents Larry the rights of the risk to her is this is you know if this was a company that was doing great and reporting huge profits and their future looked great far out into the future\nDoing great and reporting huge profits and their future looked great far out into the future then you take the monthly check is almost always the monthly check them pews\nHigher return than you are going to be able to generate on your own on this pension distribution but the lump sum\nYou know she gets the money\nSo I always tell people take the monthly check unless you're worried about the company's finances\nOh I don't know which way to go\nI think it's a matter of ... and let's look at it this way if she takes the monthly check and let's say three four or five years from now they fail\nWith it or would it just demolish your quality of life and your ability to afford things or would it be more like a well we're not going to have that money every month but will still be okay\nHey we're here oh well\nIf it's an old well and you're going to be fine either way take the monthly check if it's money that's do or die for you as a couple I Would take a lot of some\n... or ... you know\nSo and I would I Would say with her as well because she worked there for so long psychological you may bother her a lot is you know the pensions stops for is a new wouldn't be stop it would be greatly reduced and the event of a failure\nRight cause that help\nOkay here's here's with us\nBecause you know I'm fortunate enough to have a pension benefit that I have to choose at some point lump sum or receive as a lifetime benefit and these are tough decisions how to choose Sheryl is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Cheryl\nHi how are you great thank you\nYeah like I said as I heard an advertisement I'm On the radio about real estate company that I'm next to Africa if they're willing to and can be a fair market price on your home without fixing it up or getting getting repairs\nEither will tell your house in six six or less guaranteed or they will buy it at that market price that they offered to you and I honestly think to get to the truth I thought I checked with you\nSo this is happening around the country residential real estate is a very high interest item right now so there are local real estate offices\nLocal individual uh but high volume sellers and national offers where they say we not only will market your house but if it does not sell we guarantee that will be the purchaser\nMhm and as for what the purchase period is most often what I've seen is you said six weeks for the one you saw\nLike six or less\nMost of them I've seen are twelve weeks\n[noise] 'cause normally for someone to effectively market your home they need typically a three month window but anyway if you found somebody who says six weeks fine so these\nCome in two types one is selling distressed real estate let's say you're having to sell the house of a loved one who died near the administrator executor executive ... that's one ... the other is where you're selling your own home\nYou know you're having to relocate was somewhere else so you've already done if I had the home you want to move to you need certainty getting your house so so in that environment it's not a distress sale it's not a house is falling apart or anything like that\nAnd you're just looking for certainty that the sale will go through and you're not going to get stuck with two house payments so with these things the\nKey test is they offered they make as to what their fallback price would be ... is it one you can live with\nYeah actually the price that they offered us for family tree praying ... and it couldn't add on I was actually surprised I thought it would the lander\nThen I think that's fine if it gets you the peace of mind that you're working for\nMhm and\nThen you know the six weeks out if it's not sold in the open market you're out of that house why not\nThey are saying that they charge a six percent there that have been like a fair price\nSo they would do you pay six percent commission if they find a buyer you discount the price six percent if they're the buyer okay is that right\nIt's beret and you had six percent that included the buyer and seller for if they buy it outright I don't know I just caught fire not\nWell normally they would they would have some discount it would be the equivalent of a commission from the price they are offering you and I have no problem with that\nOkay okay so you got to be the right person do you got to be the person you need to be done with it and you know that you'll be out of the house at that point and if they\nPrice they offer use reasonable why not have that certainty okay found it and\nI and I hope I don't hear back from you at some point have six weeks come and gone and made it an honor the deal\nI Hope he does not sell I Will tell you that that's never happened before oh okay well again\nNo one's ever called me and said that I'm not going to say that they haven't ever done that to somebody with one of these all can I get from one of these companies but nobody's ever given me that feedback the thing that's unusual what you said Sheryl is it the purchase price they're offering you\nIs there a fallback price is in your words spot on and that's not what I usually heard from people usually I've heard\nI just hope people take a moment to reflect on that fenced in Rosenberg and at the ocean and also a dedicated public servants\nLocal news when you needed one on one by one o seven trying do

again I'm going to fill you in on that and just a little while\nSo earlier this year I talked about how the cost of houses around the country was out running people's ability to afford them\nAnd you can't have a situation where the price of something goes up continually beyond people's incomes were rising income so that when you take something like um education\nAnd all the problems we had with the cost of college\nCollege costs have been going up generally a double the rate of inflation and the economy overall and two and a half times\nPeople's growth in income something has to give and so there's been a moderation college costs would even a number of colleges cutting the effective cost that you pay\nWell let's take homes after the real estate bus last decade we weren't in the doldrums

the Clark Howard Joe WHM the news information and they are\nDoing just fine thanks for [noise]\nSo what is it is frustrating [noise]\nWell I'd like to be able to travel from one major metropolitan area through an adjoining say if this is my dad who's in a sense this living facility\nAnd I'm like the Milan day I could pick up and go tomorrow if there was a good deal on airfare I could go that day or two weeks from now or whatever I mean I I have work to build it allowed me to go to miss a day on on short notice\nWhat I'd like to be able to do is try and get the very lowest possible deal but I can afford to travel go down and my dad and then why back home\nAnd the same day that that ... thing but most traveled by they want you to point out of the day and so you're you're looking for that day by day and it it's hard to find the best deal\nSo the three deep discounters are doing what you want\nMe now at spirit air allegiance air and frontier which is a three part discounters are deep discounters but uh you earn your savings because it's a different way of flying\nWith all of them when you go to search if any of the three serve the area you want to fly they put up a calendar for you and they show you the fare each direction\nThey serve the area you want to fly they put up a calendar for you and they show you the fare each direction day by day for a two month period\nOkay so you can actually see well gosh there's a forty two dollar fare on a Wednesday two weeks from now I like that what's the return and you see if they have a deal coming back as well\nRight there is no we're quibbling on the three full fare alliance on American United and delta the fares are um they're not into discounting at all really right now\nIt looks like some states must go unsold\nNo the the um load factors the percent of seats filled is an all time record highs the airlines have become so sophisticated and figuring out what the last seat can sell for and so they're flying flight after flight\nCompletely full or just about and so the the desire to discount isn't there anymore because when American United and delta did was they parked huge numbers of planes in the desert and said Bye bye to them\nThen reduced the number of planes that they have in the air and so they manage this supply so they could control what they could demand and fares from people who wanted to go\nSo we are creating basically a three speed air travel market\nThe three deep discounters I mentioned the legion frontier and spirit\nFor offering one kind of product when the MIT prices like southwest Jet Blue Virgin America Alaska they're offering a different kind of product more a blend between those two extremes\nBut if you're trying to get down to see your dad had the cheapest fare with the greatest flexibility when you go in return [noise] absolutely a frontier a legion and spirit for where you're going to want to get your deal [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] an official message from Medicare open enrollment ends in so now's the time to reopen might look at everything like prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans have insurers why because time strange so can you help me I found lower ... aren't extra benefits and save money\nBut everything with its extra like the big baggage charges but then they have another fair it's just a little higher\nThat comes with a free checked bag is much cheaper to buy overall to buy that next fair up and get your free bag but when you're shopping around and you're looking at prices\nWhat you see is oh that low fare on Jet Blue which works great if you don't check a bag and used to carry on but follow with me for a second what's going on with delta American in the United\nStates now Alaska coming in with the one of these junk fares these basic economy things where they can show up better in the air fare searches but knowing that people overwhelmingly aren't going to buy that fair\nAnd it's just a bait and switch so know that the cause of the Internet and our ability to shop around\nAnd the whole comparison shopping thing that we now can do everybody's trying to manipulate us and so it's up to you and me to know that you know you got burned wind shame on them you got burned the second time shame on you\nDo the work where you look not just at that initial click but what really is the total price one and actually I wanted to mention to you with American Airlines with its basic economy fares different than delta United and Alaska\nWhere with delta United in Alaska often you have just a little tick up in price to go from basic economy to regular economy American on the other hand looks at bases\nJust a little tick up in price to go from basic economy to regular economy American on the other hand looks at basic economy one of its strategies is specifically targeted at spirit legion frontier\nAnd the basic economy that they sell them markets competitive with them maybe half the cost or less with their regular economy is and then you got quite a choice to make Christopher\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show Christopher you want to worship the sun is that right\nThere and why is the son so great other than it makes me in a much better mood\nAnd it gives us and solar power\nFree power yeah you know I'm I Am I'm the wrong person to ask about solar cars I Love it when\nYou talk about it so much you're making me a lotta\nSo do you have it or are you thinking of getting it or where where are you in your head on\nYes sir I'm I'm thinking about getting solar power and I'm just wondering at what point it would make sense for me to do it\nAs far as you know looking at how much I've spent locally on my electric bill is fairly low anywhere from ... to one twenty per month is typical electric bill\nAnd so just looking at whether it makes sense or not to pull the trigger and how long it'll take any that you know ... for the money and stuff like that\nYou know if your average power bill let's just say is twelve hundred dollars a year it would take a long time for solar to pay off for you how many square feet to your home\nAround a Seventeen hundred square feet\nCase that's kind of a typical size home so you may be looking at somewhere around ten thousand dollars to put in so we're at your home ... have you gotten any price quotes is that about what you've heard\nYeah I just recently got close and ah it was for ten thousand four hundred dollars but that also included\nIncreasing the value of my aunts late send an addict it talked about the radiant barrier a solid addict fan and a new talks about putting in a new heat pump water hybrid heat fall\nOkay so that's a lot for ten for now you know on the solar portion you're eligible for thirty percent tax credit\nYes sir and he was saying he did it all together that everything can fall under that Thirteen percent tax credit\nSo you'd end up you know you'd end up at a net of Seventy two hundred dollars let's say for your net cost is that right or is it ten for after the tax credit\nI Believe the tenth floor was after\nOkay ten thousand dollars you know it would it would take you a substantial number of years to make that back maybe more than would make sense from strictly dollars and cents\nYes because what you're fighting against as you already have a very reasonable power bill so as much as I Love getting free power from the sun you have to weigh that money out out front that ten grand up front\nAnd I don't know that you're gonna make it back in a reasonable number of years because your power bill is not going to go to zero it's going to go lower\nBut you might be talking about somewhere twelve to Fifteen Years\nTo get paid back that's a long time\nOkay what's your thoughts on the a hybrid heat pump water heater as it looks like and just looking at that energy guy sticker on side of my life that it's around five hundred and forty one dollars annually and then the one that they're they're selling is around a hundred and eighty two dollars annually\nYeah and those attackers are generally a very accurate so if you were just saved three hundred and something dollars per year how much is that portion of the home improvement\nOr Fifteen hundred\nSo that would be that would make a lot of sense you want to look for a payback period on any energy related improvement you do have eight years or less okay so that would easily get done and less time than that\nAnd would make perfect sense to do now the one thing with the civil war that is the unknown and it depends on how people would value at the time you go to sell your home\nSomebody very well might pay you more for your home because it has the software on it because they would pay much lower power bills but if you look at it strictly from the numbers you present it\nAnd the pay back years it would take installing solar I don't think you were there at your house because you have been so lucky with how low your power bills are I don't think you'd get the real pay back from it\nMichael's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\nClarke they'll show\nIt's great to have you here I'm very interested in your question about DNA testing\nIs a lot of family or wanting to do a Christmas present for our daughter and she was like the heritage profile in one of the things that you know there are multiple ones out there and I'm concerned about you know water her risk as far as getting the information shared out into the world\nAnd uh you know what are the cause of this for that and are there any product that you might be able to recognize that\nWell I have never heard about a risk of buying one of the services that you can buy on the Internet where you
