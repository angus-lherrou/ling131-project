consistent with an alienation of the population from its self radicalization so that those who disagree are being forced to choose sides\nAre in Andrew Darrell bunker his new book the war before the war\nHe presented the story of fugitive slaves and the struggle for American Soul from the revolution to the civil war this is a a historical analogy if it works and Michael is identified that the abolitionist the Eighteen fifties look very much like the strong minded\nA social justice warriors of the eight of the early twenty first century and according to the analogy here both sides are forcing those in between to choose so that they're destroying the middle there discouraging the middle what is lost when that happens well dunk or things of that\nI'm Wondering read a passage that he's sites in his introduction this is from Richard Haass setter the story and\nHe wrote this up in Nineteen sixty eight during the year fifty years ago when the U.S was pulling itself apart over the Vietnam War over civil rights over violence in Europe over the Cold War pulling itself apart\nAnd ... wrote about the loss of comedy that is a concern for ... that was a concern in the Eighteen fifty and Michael when I talk about it because that means there is no center when it comes down to according to ... this comedy exist\nIn a society that to the degree that those enlisted in its contending interests have a basic minimal regard for each other\nOne part of your interest seeks the defeat of an opposing interest on matters of policy but at the same time seeks to avoid crushing the opposition denying the legitimacy of its existence or its values or inflicting upon an extreme and gratuitous humiliation\nBeyond the substance of the games that are being thought\nThe basic humanity of the opposition is not forgotten civility is not abandon\nThe sense that a community life must be carried on after the issues of the moment have been fought over and one is seldom very far out of mind and awareness that the opposition will someday be the government is always present repeat an awareness of the opposition will someday be the government is always present\nThe reality in value of comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which is almost completely lacking Michael that's a warning half that I wrote it in Nineteen sixty eight we know that at some point\nThe alienation that we experience today started there and the Vietnam War we noticed we lived through it we were young men then\nWonderful and important that those sentiments should come from a Richard upstairs because Richard hopes that it was writing a in the Nineteen sixties in in before or Vietnam\nOr the fifties and sixties in the last period of the after glow of World War two that created the longest lasting period not simply of comedy comedy but of a sense of national kinship and unity\nThat that Ben began to the phrase slowly\nThe ... comedy but a lot of a sense of national kinship and unity\nThat that then began to the phrase slowly with Vietnam and has unraveled to the point where it is today much like the period before the civil war but hop status was writing from a period where both both of elites in America you know right and left to that extent we're\nWe're committed to the same larger vision and up to each other or there's no getting around it and today the opposite is true and what's really important and dump out go I'm In in in all of his\nWriting about ... abolitionist civil war underscores the fact that the Appalachian is considered terrorists and to be necessary if only to break the never ending gradually lists of goods and met a quote in his book on the\n... because they mention I didn't enjoy the opposition not on the basis of policy but physically destroy so that the opposition would never be the government that's what they meant to do\nExactly and it is it because\nAs I'm as radical a profit seeking to expunged what is April ... funding of evil is the destruction of fat author\nOr elite party which is no longer fraternal but now the devil incarnate and what this does which is exactly what happened in the Eighteen fifties is that this\nI'm a clear and uh you know unvarnished declaration that we're out to to ah to reform you and make you submit and if you refuse you will be expunged it's exactly what drove south to\nThe intense aggressiveness that they exhibited in the Eighteen fifty it's not just the fugitive slave act but all of the ... of terrorism and and and the like\nYou can listen the canning of some neuron the Dred Scott decision and the fugitive slave all the log going to Boston and humiliating the Bostonians by having to deliver up a young man we we've gone through all of this Michael and we see the same the same cycle going on today right one side seeks to humiliate when defeating the other side\nThey there is no possibility in the minds of either of the a radical elites today that they can survive without\nDestroying the other and the fact is that the red side which is a smaller elite as we've discussed and which is less are connected\nTo the thing is of national power in Washington and in the economy certainly the the the rat a side is on the defense and they just quite clear a and you can see it from the larger national media that there is a dominant uh voice uh and\nAnd the preponderance of of a ... she might say a ... on the part of blue and blue is seeking um total an absolute objectives right\nNow ... highly Michael pie asleep thinking there is there is a tough election that does not truck debate it hits us is it has its asserted and that's the end of it\nThis is why we use terms like virtue signaling and wipe out co uses a a a term\nOf art like an

about how Jared Kushner\nAnd it was that you can lead on well ...\nShots for like ... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know in ... that oh you know what kind of sketchy deals as you doing where he's\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Christmas politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives in attacks on set up that have been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well Christians in the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab them renovate salmon writes them out\nThere are some specific depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can take some upfront deductions um that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many case up to a million dollars a year John\nAnd if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property into service\nYou can take a big tax deduction for Cushing who did this to the extent are they the directions were even exceeded his income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well\nSo everything you did was completely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy\nA business owners themselves should be paying attention to that kind of tax strategy making investments like that in capital equipment property taking the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business move and I hope that a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their client did\nThe tax cuts and jobs active twenty Seventeen make this even more attractive as because this is what will be the first year we discovered that [noise] yeah it did so do these these deductions\n... I've been in place for a while I mean the big one that a lot of business owners need to be aware of its called section one Seventy nine deduction just ask your account and about that that deduction year after year I'm is kind of up for whether or not it was going to be renewed ball and the taxi format\nNot only was it made permanent but it was increased from like five hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars that businesses can take as a as an accelerated depreciation to touch and\nNot only that in the tax reform act the act at allowed an added more deductions for certain business used vehicles trucks in your business as well that didn't exist before\nSo these are all things that are there and you and I are talking about this now it's late October there is still time left in the year business owners that you can you can make investments in capital of the equipment you can get them finance put him into service before the end of the year and take a significant tax deduction while doing that and why not\nWhat the number again Jane\n[noise] you can the section in the iris ... one Seventy nine one section one Seventy nine you want to ask your account and about\nTrade war we are\nPuzzled as to where it is and where or when it's going to visit our house to trade for\nThe dispute with Canada as you mentioned in Mexico looks to be moving toward resolution the dispute with Europe\nHas not has not at this point crashed anybody's economy and Europe is talking but there's a dispute with China as I indicated is going to drag on does this worry small businesses because they're worried about the macro economy or can they see this in their prices\nWell there is that there there was a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to recreate affected by the trade war but their indirectly affected by the trade war and\nThere are large companies like Ford who had announced the approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off\nBecause of increasing costs and Harley Davidson that's moving operations to ah you know other countries that side of the U.S to avoid ah the terrorists that they would have to pay and companies like three am and caterpillar\nThat our face you increase costs on on some of the core materials that they buy 'em and also some of the markets that they might be losing because of the war that's going on right now and it is a war\nWith China that as an indirect impact on on all the small contractors suppliers vendors that that work up to those larger companies and then of course there's the consumer effect there is you know their most recent round of tariffs do affect electronics and consumer goods that are being sold by\nThe Wal Marts than the targets of the world and\nThat you know filters down to consumers who for many you know our our customers of small businesses and if they're paying more they're a well to take away some disposable income that they could be spending this holiday season\nA at a small merchants are or restaurants so it does have that impacts right now like you said things are pretty much resolved with Canada and Mexico to be aware you know all the legislatures still have to approve this right so\nThat's still up in the air depending on how the midterms go\nEurope right now we're sort of at a truce so discussions continue on with China like you mentioned before is the big thing\nI I was at a meeting of small a bunch of small manufacturers just this week in Minneapolis and some of them were saying that all of this you know you ... yelling and screaming between the Chinese and and the American counterparts\nIs all coming down to Trump and president gee\nI'm meeting in November and I am one guy stood up and said you know what I understand what Trump is doing when I have a big agreement that I'm going to make with a significant supplier I Want to meet that person face to face and work it out with him I don't need my sales guys are representatives doing on my part\nAnd some people think that that's what Trump strategy is that it's a lot of bravado and all building up to the big deal that ah that that the two of them are going to are going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that happening\nI Know I'm not however I Do have a positive here to end this the macro consumers are spending Jean yeah ending spending and spending the wall Street Journal notes that\nThe consumer spending is powered by all the jobs and the really good jobs and that means a good Christmas season and that's what we care about right now\nAgreed agreed and you know I think that the president now at your realizes we've heard that GDP um you know potentially impacted by a trade issues with China but John I mean right now GDP is growing and like you said consumers are spending in the economy is strong and\nUh you know maybe from the president's perspective is like if I'm if we're going to fix this issue with China an issue that so many of my clients have been complaining about for years why not do it now when we're in a position of being well we have a strong economy Jean right\nMarks it's the small

of the country or what that means is that they now are confident they can down the issues with the Saudis rocket\nNow there's a variety of choices rockets but all of them generally use the same first and second stage configurations which is what was the problem on that first launch that bad last two weeks ago the changes or the third stage uh they do use various different stages and so\nThis launch was a success and it does indicate that they're getting closer to solving the problem it's more important is that they wanted to do a variety of unmanned test launches with the soy use to make sure that got things right\nAnd this is one of them that got at least two more before the man flying December that means I assessed as almost certainly not going to end up having to be evacuated ...

people in those neighborhoods\nI'm I'm a little bit skeptical as to whether he can I'm actually make a big debt in crime I mean part of the problem is is this is organized crime and it's funded by ah the drug habits of wealthy Brazilians and wealthier Europeans and at American um who\nBy drugs or you know through the supply chains but eventually\nThese are the people who are supplying them so um those people have a lot to lose their very well armed um I think it might be very difficult for him to dismantle the organized crime groups not like\nNobody has ever tried before I'm having said that I think he's going to do some very simple basic things\nTo try to get on the side of the police I'm In a way that the government has not dead the problem is that the police are basically withdrawn their presence is not there in some of these\nAre tough neighborhoods they've given up this territory and one of the reasons is because the civilian government has not a stuck with them when they get into trouble um so they're not they don't have enough weapons and for example if you're a police\nAnd you shoot somebody and one of these neighborhoods basically immediately there's an investigation against you uh um and you're you're pretty much considered guilty until you prove yourself innocent um which you know he sort of saying\nYou know if you're in one of these neighborhoods and you shoot someone there should be an investigation to see it you should be prosecuted or not there should be you know you should get the benefit of the doubt you should be\n... you should be able to say I'm innocent until proven guilty like any other citizen would they and you know I think that this reminds me a little bit of what are we they did in Columbia\nWhich is basically to to get on the same side as the military and say I will defend you in your in your work against these criminal organizations and of course the rebate did not defense defeat those organizations but he did reclaim\nUm the

championship gets streamed online and it can get more viewers than a World Series game video games are no longer a sub culture there are no longer just a little past time they are in many regards as big as Hollywood movies they're as big as professional sports\nThat's Andrew urban a critic and author who explores the past present and future of video games in his book bit by bit\nOh videogames transformed by world and he's right\nLast year's televised championship of the game league of legends drew a staggering thirty six million viewers about Fifteen million more than watch the cubs beat the Indians in game seven of the world series\nAnd five million more than tuned into the decisive game seven of the NBA Finals urban says whether we all notice that are not video games have become as major and entertain been medium is anything else\nThere is an perhaps too easy parallel to draw with the history of cinema that's\nA useful analogy and it takes us pretty far but not all the way where the early days of cinema it was merely a\nTechnical achievement that cinema was great because all the sudden they're moving pictures and all of a sudden they're sound with them and then she there's color and all these different technical advances\nHelped people who are thinking in terms of artistry in self expression they started to use these tools to their advantage Orson Welles certainly didn't invent cinema but he revolutionized he demonstrated that it is a valid artistic platform\nOr art form we saw the same sort of development with video games where beginning at Nineteen fifty eight at a government lab on Long Island we had a game called tennis for to that by any definition today's is crude and\nFrankly boring but every generation added to the technical prowess at our fingertips\nOf course we're growing popularity video games have very famously been scored the game doom has been blamed for embolden ing the Columbine shooters in the months leading up to the massacre\nMore recently parenting groups have come out against games like call of duty and mortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence urban says this isn't so much\nMortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence urban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture needs to reckon with\nPeople don't understand that video games are just another form of expression and they're still seen as\nSomething other than what we're accustomed to from our storytelling media a large part of that I think has to do with the perception of video games\nAs violent most people when we think of video games we think of\nGuns and militaristic shoot 'em ups first person shooter games and it's true that those are often the most popular and best selling games every year just as the most popular and best selling films tend to be quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex\nThere are also the local art house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there are an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea cross\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more\nThan just violent he says there's so much more to the vast library of games than just first person shooters\nVideo games can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards is the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie and has brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles but there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual level and making us rethink the world and our own assumptions about it\nUrban says that it was a child in the Nineteen seventies the light bulb that video games could be more than just disposable entertainment wind off in his mind when he was just a kid\nIt's one of those experiences that right now we take for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it there is a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred and this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen that represented us as players\nAnd of course this is how the U.S now we have avatars in every game we play\nWhere all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we saw that I saw that was this little innocuous square on an Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor of the living room with the controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I I think it's true\nThat Walt Whitman famously said I'm large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude and we are complex difficult creatures with that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd as time has gone on urban says that experiences\nBecome even more engaging as the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kinds of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing\nAnd I think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an inter activity to reading there's an indoor activity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect that is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately light films before them video games and transcended their status as a technical achievement and becomes something more powerful\nThe general idea that I started with is Kevin videogame be a work of art\nHas the definition of what we consider art broadened enough or had video games progressed enough as it medium that they've become artful\nAnd what I've discovered is that the ladder is certainly true that there are video games right now that are doing all the things that great movies do in great books do great TV does we're seeing that more and video

this movie is a fitting sendoff\nRedford stars as an aging bank robber based on the real life criminal Forrest Tucker\nIn the film Tucker is a gentleman stick 'em up artist a man who wields a gun at

session was over before the visit was over he said to her and next time you come in I'd like to talk to you about weight loss surgery\nPool says there haven't been studies on the extent to which doctors blame every morality and obesity and don't bother to look beyond what you can't miss the stories that even a sore throat might be blamed on a person's wage rules as many people seem to think fat shaming has value perhaps especially with the doctors doing\nThere seems to be this ongoing public perception that maybe wait bias or stigma not such a bad thing maybe it will motivate or incentivize people to lose weight\nWhen you look at the research on that and we actually see that exactly the opposite is true that being a target of weight stigma or bowling or discrimination leads to a range of negative\nEmotional and physical health consequences till we see that that increases the risk of\nDepression and anxiety\nAnd suicidal thinking but we also see that it leads to a range of maladaptive or unhealthy behaviors like increasing calorie intake disordered\nEating binge eating bought into physical activity there are now longitudinal studies showing that over time people who are discriminated against because of their weight actually have an increase to likelihood of obesity weight gain over time and we also see that this leads to heightened physiological stress\nPeople actually kind of believe that shaming someone and I don't think that doctors intentionally mean to shame someone but that is the end result that's simply not\nSome people actually kind of believe that shaming someone and I don't think that doctors intentionally mean to shame someone but that is the end result that's\nSimply not an effective motivator and in fact it leads people to feel like well why should I take care of myself I'm really not a very good person anyway and my doctor already assumes that I'm not doing what I should be doing\nStudies show that there are medical consequences as well\nPatients who perceive that they had been stigmatized about their weight\nBy a doctor have less trust and that Dr\nThey tend to have really imperative treatment outcome for that for example they might not lose as much weight if they're trying to lose weight they're more likely to avoid future healthcare services like preventive health care services they're more likely to avoid future medical appointments and we also see kinda from that providers side\nEvidence that doctors and they actually spend less time in appointments with patient cannot be compared to than our patients that they provide less health education they don't tend to build as much emotional rapport and they report having less desire to help these patients compared to enter a patient\nSays millions of patients simply quit going to the doctor rather than allow themselves to be judged visit after visit sometimes he says it has tragic consequences as it did with his own grandmother\nMy grandmother was obese throughout her adult life the doctors that she went to back in those days wag that admonishing finger Everytime and everything that was ever bothering her better health all she ever heard was lose weight which obviously she couldn't do if she could have lost the weight and kept it off she would have done that\nShe just stopped going to the doctor and tragically in her case\nShe developed breast cancer but wasn't being screened when she first presented with it it was very far advanced and she died very young a vet a static breast cancer that could have been caught early and treated\nIf she'd been going to doctors routinely and specifically because of the harsh treatment for weight she didn't go\nSo what can medicine due to break the cycle cats in pools say it has to start in medical school my teaching would be doctors to be more aware of personal attitude and biases and the causes of obesity or a lot more complex than mere personal responsibility cater says doctors also need to learn to focus less on weight alone\nFocus on the behaviors that enhanced health regardless of a person's size and shape so it's really a model that\nTurned his attention away from the number on this scale or your BMI and instead says well bodies are born to be diverse\nSome people are no matter how they take care of themselves well probably always be thinner people some people no matter how they take care of themselves are always going to be larger fatter people so that goal really is to encourage positive behaviors\nBut ... says all of those changes would amount to swimming upstream if our culture doesn't change\nMaybe we have the expectation that physicians are going to come in\nFix this but are greater culture is actively propagating obesity right America runs on Dunkin' we market multi colored marshmallows is part of a complete breakfast McDonalds and Coca Cola or the sponsors of the Olympic Games and the TV coverage of it so and it just throughout our culture\nThere is massive propagation of confusion about what a healthy diet is about what it's okay to eat about the idea that you can drink all the Coca Cola you want to oriole burn it all off if you go tiptoe into the tulips so our culture conspired to create an obesity epidemic\nAnd then people suffer the metabolic consequences show up to a physician's office and we seem to think that physicians should fix that I disagree\nCater says one more factor will be important ending the reverse of obesity by what she calls the ... river which the automatic assumption that seemed people make good lifestyle

council of economic advisers under President Ford\nAnd was appointed chair of the bed by President Reagan is co author a dream world rich who is with us this morning is the economists political editor

altogether Mr will rich but I Would appreciate turning to the\nBack of the book if I might and it is I mean I should note for readers is really reasonable it makes economics accessible and I really appreciate that I'd like to turn to the park\nIs titled entered Trump where you have a few comments about President Trump but not a lot about this tax cut for corporations and for the upper one percent of taxpayers in the United states\nAnd I'm Wondering how you feel about and you and Mr Greenspan feel about this recent tax cut whether it's good for the United states and whether it matters anymore now that the Republicans don't seem to care that we're going to have trillion dollar deficits yearly for as long as the eye can see what's what's your position on that\nWell I think the if you look at the American corporate tax rate\nUh which was a Dutch fought to sense it was very high by global standards and not just high but dysfunctional because it wage a lot of American global companies to keep very large amounts of money ... sitting that basically do nothing\nUm so you go to these sort of tradition dollar cash mansions sending them money not being used for productive investments so I think there was everything to be that the tax cuts\nYou've got these sort of trillion dollar cash mansions sending them money not being used for productive investments so I think there was everything to be ... that the tax cuts but not for the top one percent of the fuck\nCorporations um and corporations paying less corporate tax they have more money available for\nInvestments so that's not my massive water and I I I speak for myself not not not a doctor Greenspan that that's something I wanted my worry is um the um unfunded entitlements you know the fact that you're cutting taxes\nWhilst entitlements going up and up in up it's it's like a balance and therefore you know a a deficit and it's actually not massively difficult to to to\nDisclose that deficit it's quite possible to do it by a mixture of raising the retirement age raising taxes or a combination all of the two could you know you could bring your own to be back into balance but just cutting taxes without ... without addressing the that the size and they should have been talking which is not good policy making\nThe book talks about your your book with Alan Greenspan talks a lot about the supposed or what you fear is the lack of dinosaurs in in the United states that we're no longer as the creative economy as we used to be\nKnown to go to school I mean one of the arguments you make in this book is we've got to go to look at the loan to run the show to look at the long term and in entitlements longtime entitlements his bankruptcy also look at the long term and climate change but then talk about it because there was a big enough book with a lot of\nStuff in it but I Would ... be massively in favor of um intervening in that area but intervening using the price mechanism to price the extra knowledge of the costs of of of pollution and things like that but I think one of the reasons what businesses are becoming more and more reluctant to invest is getting more and more worried about it's a\nLoan to the long term goals of climate change that that wouldn't that money\nSo you think that you know in a word that in fact the government has a significant role to play in combating climate change\nThrough ... through through the price mechanism but yes absolutely\nOkay we have to leave it there we've been speaking with Adrian ... new book with Dr Alan Greenspan's

misfortune to watch some of the reasons a playoff games on TV has seen a number of TV ads opposing question one who said staffing ratio of nurses to patients in hospitals\nWe have with us to discuss question one this morning in the studio Don stern\nWho is co chair of the Massachusetts niche nurses association bargaining unit of basic medical center in Franklin she's a mental health nurse and Suzanne love also coach Aaron emergency department nurse and a union representative has well they are volunteers and the effort to pass a patient with limits in Massachusetts\nI let's start with Donna string and we'll go to Suzanne ... a\nLot of bad a publicity uh generated paid for publicity for the most part opposing question one you support question one tell us why\nWon't good morning everyone and thank you bills thank you Monti for having us here today [noise] I support question one because I just want to do my job the best I can as a nurse and right now in caring for too many patients at one time\nThis bill is about setting safe patient limits on how many patients we care for at one time\nRight now the only place where there are limits regulated limits by the law\nOr the intensive care units anywhere else there we have absolutely no say or control over how many patients we care for at one time\nAnd all the research clinical independent scientific research says we care for too many patients is dangerous it's just dangerous and it's unnecessary\nThe one state which has a law similar to that which is proposing question one is California ... has been a lot of debate about whether this war has worked in California and or what the effect has been tell us about that\nThat's a great question I'm so let's let's talk about California California's had this law in place for over fourteen years\nI I think California's a great sample size um because it has over three hundred hospitals one out of seven people in the United states receive health care in California\nUh that's how big California's\nThe outcomes in California have been fantastic so for example Massachusetts AS number forty eight out of fifty for wait times in the emergency room\nCalifornia is a times or forty seven percent faster since they put this law in place a their hospital based infections have have gone down significantly\nHigh rates of re admission have gone down significantly rates of death medication areas these are all related to nurse staffing\nLet's go back from it question one says what about staffing what is the actual\nProvisions return Suzanne of torture written see department nurse proponent of question one helpless\nQuestion what lessons have the right the right number of patients per nurse when these patients are in the hospital and what's the right number\nSo if you look at so people have asked this question many many times like well how did you come up with a number\nSo it's a combination of over Twenty years of research and looking at California's outcomes and also working with bedside nurses\nAre across the state for years it's based on the unit that you're on so for example most people are familiar with medical surgical unit so right now you can have a a let's say at Franklin on average those nurses are caring for I don't know six seven invasions down in the bay state Springfield\nThey're caring for eight or more all the research and the outcomes say that that nurse shouldn't have up to four patients at one time on a psych unit like mine it would be up to five\n... in in the emergency room Suzanne it would be up to three patients three to four patients so that's specifically related to the unit you are on it's very unit specific in addition the bill\nSo it's three in the ER for on a medical\nSurgical up to four because the the opposition would like to tell you that that's a rigid rigid number and what we're saying is it's up to four and the law also talks about using acuity tools\nSo right now I promise you as a nurse went on caring for too many patients at one time there is no autonomy I don't have any freedom I'm just running around hoping I can do the very best than that I can this law would allow me\nTo use acuity tools my clinical judgment and say you know what right now my patients are so sick that I think I can safely take care of for versus five\nSo there is flexibility within those numbers but it's up to four on a medical surgical for\nSo there's two points that I Want to make about that just because in a a law become goes into effect on a particular date or\nIt doesn't actually mean it's in effect yeah like where's my potshots exactly mighty so and I I'm Sorry for your Monti\nYes and I don't feel sorry for money but but ... he'll he'll get some help but I\nDo think it's important to note this because this has gotten lost in the entire discussion\nWhich is the proposition ... has the same legal status as any other law passed by the legislature and the legislature can amend it and it can change it until there's a problem it's not written in stone this is not a constitutional amendments it's a lost\nIt is and so let's talk about okay goes in January one\nThe I promise you this guy's not going to fall um what has to happen next we'll have to go to the health policy commission all the regulations have to be figured out not only that but all the hospitals have to submit plans on implementation\nThe acuity tools have to be designed and worked out with the nurses and the administrators and all of that is going to take months and months and months and months just like you said okay so this idea that\nAnd they don't have your vision is ... to ... go\nBingo and you know that there's going to be when this passes and as you can hear me say when this passes because it's the right thing to do when this passes\nThere is going to be a period where we're going to have to fight to make sure\nThat the revisions don't destroy the integrity of what the bedside nurses have written because this is really about your safety the other thing I Want to say to the other argument that people are saying well there aren't enough nurses how are we ever going to need this so I I\n... I I I Love this interview or you have to answer my own questions\nNew [laughter] it's like Caroline Hawaii [laughter] you know\nAl ... said oh that's not really a lot of fun you know I liked about I Would I Would love you actually to\nSpeak about the both of those questions one is the claim that there are a lack of nurses so this is impossible to build as well in any event and then let's get to the money because ... she uses a number today I've never heard ... nurse stepping ratios would cost about a billion\nDollars in ... that we want to wish ...\nLet's talk about the nurses first jerk they don't talk about the money and then the most important thing though\nAbout this interview though is about patient safety and there is nobody better to talk about patient safety than Suzanne so but I'm going to I'm going to talk about the nurses I'm going to talk\nAbout the money right because the first was sort of winners is there's a claim there is a shortage of nurses in Massachusetts and it's this war goes into effect medical centers hospitals are not going to be able to hire the nurses because they're not there what's the answer to that\nIn many parts of our country there is a nursing shortage there's two states that do not have a nursing shortage Massachusetts in North Dakota we graduate three thousand ... thousand three thousand five hundred nurses in this state and you're just an I Ninety One court or\nFrom Springfield Greenfield there's six schools with seven programs there's\nPlenty of nurses rules was seven nursing\nBroke nursing program at UMass has to nursing programs so there are plenty of nurses in Massachusetts other parts of the country not the case\nSo there are enough nurses nurses have left the bedside at the hospital because it's just too stressful it's scary sometimes to have too many patients who are sick of trying to juggle who\nI have four things I should be doing right now they're all things I should be doing right now it's hard to decide which one I'm going to do sometimes what everybody needs something from me\nThis will allow it to split the bill will allow patients have the right level of care hospitals will be able to hire nurses they'll be able to bring nurses back to the bedside nurses went back to the bedside when this law passed in California a hundred thousand return to the bad side in California's\nBedside nurses as opposed to some other\n... yeah and then are as yet side nurses and somebody that for one reason nurses have left the hospital is they moved a lot of them to being part time position people need full time work with benefits\nWas talking about yes I'm\nSorry one other thing I Want on the Internet 'cause this is an answer that question beautifully or the other thing I Want to add to is Massachusetts has\nOne of the largest group of nurses working part time or pre DM which is a you know in a casual basis who would love fulltime work but the hospitals will not post those positions\nBecause they don't want to pay for the benefits they just do this is a a cost saving measure it's cheaper to have pre DM nurses in part time nurses so they don't have to pay for health benefits or anything else and this would actually make them [noise] have to post full time position\nOkay which will get us to the money now enthusiasm sweaters she claims quote nurse dancing ratios could cost about one billion dollars annually this means higher taxes are health insurance premiums and the whole breed of horrible yeah what's your response to that\nSo I'm gonna I'm going to talk to you about the actual costs and then I'm In uh in Massachusetts and then I'm also going to talk to you\nAre most yeah what's your responses out so I'm gonna I'm going to talk to you about the actual costs and then I'm gonna in Massachusetts and then I'm also going to talk to you about the outcomes in California so I'm not surprised that sue wrote that no ah that letter and not surprised\nThat it is it is also a codes on co authored by the uh a chair of the board of Susan\nOkay so these are executives okay we're so they're aligned with hospitals executives and the corporate dollars so I think it's really important for the listeners to just make sure that we understand who wrote that letter\nOkay I'm In terms of money so we're not really sure where they keep coming up with this figure we've asked for their their numbers we can't get a straight answer for them\nSo independent research was done out of Boston College and the independent research at Boston College says okay and again this is not something we paid for\nIndependent academically reviewed rigorous study said that this bill will not costs more than forty seven million dollars a year which means on average for every hospital that three percent three percent of their budget\nWhich is a drop in the bucket so\nThink about based aid for example they made Seventy million last year Seventy million dollars they pay their top executive over two million dollars a year so this is not about money or lack of money there is plenty of money to pay for this so this idea that somehow\nIt's going to cost a billion dollars is ludicrous\nThe other the other I I'm guessing she got that number\nIs we are definitely disappointed in the health policy commission we chose them to do the implementation help us do the implementation of this law when it passes because we thought that they were independent watchdog it turns out\nThat the health policy commission net behind closed doors with hospital executives the hospital executive turned around gave him these ridiculous ridiculous numbers and then the health policy came out and said\nWe have the numbers on how much is costing this is independent there was nothing independent about it when you don't bring both sides to the table to actually look at the numbers there is nothing independent about it\nSo that billion dollars is ludicrous it's ludicrous bill there is no fact there is no study it's all inflated numbers that were given by the hospital association it seems at each time we hear them talk about how much this little cost for the cost goes up I haven't\nI've noticed that I noticed [laughter] you know does a brilliant point and the other thing\nToo because I've been debating uh can you imagine that bill\nThat in mind that ah I have been out there did you write in strong opinions about you know I have no feelings at all about the ah ah\nSo I've been out there debating and and and so the number keeps changing too because they are the other thing they're going to try to tell you\nOh my God if this passes all the hospitals are close and all the community hospitals or\nWhere I mean that's the scary it and probably the most emotionally wrenching argument if there's any chance that who is going to close I'm opposed to it and they're making that point over and over ... about that yeah Louis let's just\nGo right for it sure first of all there are very few freestanding hospitals left\nRight and ... was part of a mess jumped they're all part of me at work\nNow we're so let's talk about ... ... and ... Dickinson is part of the partners okay do you know how much partners made last year they made over six hundred million dollars\nAnd their CEO earns for a million dollars for a million there there is no person no chance that clearly Dickinson is going to close or close any program no one hospital in California and not one hospital in California and the fourteen years has closed\nAs a result of the staff in law now in Massachusetts in the last ten years we have had hospitals hospitals closed but let me tell you why they have clothes or why programs have claws\nHas nothing to do with staffing this is that we're we're this is the first time we're actually really talking about staffing in Massachusetts so north Adams let's talk about north Adams in\nA closed four years ago why did they close that's a that was a free standing community hospital because the hospital executives mis managed the funds they had plenty of of Medicare Medicaid dollars coming in but those hospital executives made

then I left without having graduated uh because I was accepted to college and I was promised a diploma completion of my freshman year at college and for reasons that I won't go into on this call they refuse to give me that diploma\nAnd it wasn't until after I'd come back as an artist in residence in Ninety eight and then they called me asking for a donation in Ninety two thousand I guess and I

domestic violence shelters are in drug treatment programs because of the way gender markers are recorded on IDs and use to divide folks up in sex segregated facilities\nIt matters more for the disproportionate number of trans people who are poor and of color who survival is more likely at the mercy of bureaucrats and low level staff in prisons hospitals and group homes who make decisions about gender\nSpade says we need to see this White House attack as part of a broader and terrifying approach to race gender and authority\nSo while you knew what the New York times with getting at with their October twenty first headline transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump Administration\nGiven what's at stake a less artful and more straightforward shorthand Trump plans to encourage abused and discrimination against transgender\nPeople might have been more appropriate you're listening to counter spin brought to each week by the media watch groups fair [noise]\n\nAn article and affairs magazine extra about mainstream media distortions on Social Security\nSite say New York times article that describes the federal budget deficit as quote overwhelmingly a consequence of American military outlay and entitlement programs such as Social Security\nTogether with the nation's unwillingness to pay the taxes needed to finance the expenditures close quote\nA times editorial argues quote it hardly seems fair to ask more sacrifice from the working poor to maintain the living standards of the retired rich close quote\nAnd on a Sunday chat show a pundit calls the politicians defensive Social Security pandering to the elderly without contradiction [noise]\nHere's the thing that article by veteran New York times reporter and friend affair John Head was written in January Nineteen eighty eight [noise]\nCorporate media get a number of things wrong when they talk about Social Security\nBut perhaps the most significant is to present it as a contentious issue in this year's budget battles\nWhen really the fight over Social Security is an ideological one with many on one side and a few on the other\nThat's been going on since the program began eighty three years ago here now to give us some context on current headlines AS Nancy Altman\nPresident of Social Security works and author of most recently the truth about Social Security the founders words refute revisionist history zombie lies uncommon misunderstandings out this year from strongly impressed she joins us now by phone from Maryland Welcome back to counter spend Nancy Altman\nThank you so much for having me well let's start with what Mitch McConnell just said when the Senate Republican\nLeader was talking to Bloomberg on October sixteenth he called Social Security Medicare and Medicaid the real drivers of the day\nByrd on October sixteenth he called Social Security Medicare and Medicaid the real drivers of the debt\nAnd lamented both parties unwillingness to address or adjust them well some people must have thought did he accidentally say the quiet part loud and allowed part quiet you know Social Security is famously so popular that had described as the third rail of us politics than here he's saying\nShame if anything were to happen to it ah right before an election but if it was maybe brazen McConnell claims are are in a long tradition thing\nYes and I think you really captured it perfectly in your introduction this is an ideological fight this was about values\nBut the side that as opposed to Social Security president Dwight Eisenhower a letter to his brother described opponents of Social Security as negligible in under a tiny splinter group unfortunately that tiny splinter group now\nHolds rain over the Republican Party but they understand the politics low enough to not say we think Social Security socialism we don't the government should be doing this they say oh we love it but it's driving the deficit the reality is that Social Security\nDoes not add a penny to the deficit it's totally self financed\nIt is an earned benefit that we all contribute to it's got to have a balanced budget and it always has and no other but conservative president Ronald Reagan you can go on YouTube and we've got a\nGreat clip of him saying exactly that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit but this is a line that\nMitch McConnell is using and I think it's you feeling defensive because of course their tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and big corporations blew a hole in the federal budget one point five trillion dollars and now they're trying to look around and explain now don't know it wasn't us\nThat did it and so they're going after their favorite targets which they oppose on ideological grounds\nWell and they have something to work with because media I think have not\nDone a terrific job of making so concretely clear the realities of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid that when you hear these Republican claims you can say oh wait I Know I Know that's wrong you know I think in fact media\nHave some active on telling\nTo do having spent decades kind of enabling that story line you unpack and address the storyline in your book the truth about Social Security and I I Would really like to just walks through you've started to already but walk through some of the miss that seem just so difficult to dispel\nNo you're exactly right and let me before we get to them is talk about the role of the mainstream media because as I mentioned Dwight Eisenhower\nCalled the opponents a tiny splinter group which is true but they have oversized influence right because they are literal billionaires I mean the obvious or the Koch brothers but there's another who died recently Peterson who spent before his death\nA billion dollars of his own wealth\nTo spreading the lies about Social Security he was dedicated to this and set up a lot of organizations so you'll talk to various organizations committee for a responsible federal budget and all of these sound very independent objective but they've all been funded by the same group and they have the same message so the media\nAnd I must say mainstream politicians to the elites in Washington you know they go to the same cocktail parties they bought into this fortunately the Democratic party has emerged and return to its roots and seeing the light\nAnd they now are calling for expanding Social Security both Republicans are still saying we've got to save Social Security it's\nYou know it's we love it but we can't afford it and other nonsense like that which are some of them is where I think will be getting into\nAbsolutely I mean you know I was just going back through fares\nArchives on this and it's there's just no shortage I mean here we have NPR's Scott Simon this is two thousand for\nNo one would deny that Social Security is headed for a major crisis the crash in a sense has already been done because thanks to the baby boom there are fewer Americans paying into the system so\nThat is what sets up this idea of\nWhat is ultimately of course a bowl of privatization being packaged as rescuing a system that same crisis\nExactly it's all the same rhetoric and lift billionaire funded campaign has been unsuccessful in actually cutting our cash benefits but it has been successful in a couple of ways one is that\nPart of what Social Security is supposed to provide an addition to wage replacement is a sense of peace of mind security its in its name the idea that if\nThe unimaginable happens and you become disabled and can no longer work if you die prematurely levy young children or if you're fortunate and live\nTo old age you are secure in the knowledge that you have the benefit you've earned that will provide\nFor you and your family and that's something we've all contributed to and paid for so we've lost that and the way that we've lost that is that\nYou ask most Americans especially younger Americans if they think Social Security will be there for them and they say no and that's just wrong the world with projections by the Social Security administration even if Congress were to do\nNothing over the next Seventy five year the end of the twenty first century there would still be enough\nRevenue coming in to pay Seventy five cents on the dollar now that's not enough we want to have a hundred percent of the dollar to the idea that the program won't be there would take an act of Congress\nWill and I think media Austin oh Mitt that idea of government choice there is a sense of well nothing's going to be done and it's like a rock rolling down the hill when of course government make adjustments to policies all the time and could certainly do so with Social Security\nShows engineered by air recovers auto I'm Janine jak than\nThank you for listening to counter [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWhat are you more as I said you\nKnow what are you Joe it's\n[noise]\nFollowing is a paid

teaches\nUm she teaches fresh she teaches in other venues but she we were excited to get um a acquainted with Ruth because she teaches children to knit and that's something everyone can do or wants to do so\nWe're not real we're really grateful we ... we we\nCross paths and got introduced ... what did you just talk a little bit about your background and and and your love of teaching and you know how you got into knitting and just a little background for our listeners\nSure um I was an elementary teacher for many years and I'm up in Conway at the grammar school there\nAnd after I retired I got into an editing and I started teaching at the public library in along meadow about four years ago and I was working with adults and then with children and the program got too big for the library so I moved it over to my house\nSo I now running after school program one afternoon a week and kids come straight from school many of them walk or ride their bikes\nAnd I provide a snack and then we have a lesson and they all have time to net and it's worked out really well\nWorking with children is a special endeavor it's not like teaching adults too you know it's not at all and itchy and\nIt well working with children is a special endeavor it's not like teaching adults and you\nKnow it's not at all and the tea and I think it really takes a special personality you know I even look at it in terms of never my knitting but just teaching children in general you know I have friends who home schooled and and I attempted to do that with my boys I\nWe would've killed each other I think is what it comes down to and they certainly wouldn't have learned very much um so I think it is a special skills that so now we're taking this up ... another notch and you are going to be teaching our kids fiber camp which is you know how you just for the last couple of summers we'd had him on teaching it um\nAnd then you know they moved on to other things and you know going back to what we were just saying not just anybody who's willing to jump in 'em to do a kid's camp in the summer so we're thrilled that you're going to be doing that why don't you share with our listeners a little bit about how you're going to structure your your two week sessions\nAh yes well I can talk about some of the things that um the campers will learn while they're in camp um I teach the long tale cast on to everybody and have a special way of doing that with kids\nAnd they'll all learn then that stitch and they'll learn Jeanette boats on straight needles and also in the ground\nAnd we'll make several different projects usually the first thing they make us watch and then that's probably the first day or part is the first day and then everyone makes a headband the kind you would wear when you go skiing\nAnd that uses the net stitch and then I'll take some how to cast started around also had to buy off\nAnd they all make some projects like oh maybe a jar COSI or we make pillows called kitty poof we call them lots of them are kiddies\nAnd they might make a get a start on a ski hat and we use a cure sitting hip skis a\nLast minute hat pattern for that um they learn how to make pom pom so I think it's got to be a very full week there's going to be a lot going on\nWhich is which is great another two weeks is to a week long sessions being offered the first section one is the week of July night Monday through friday from nine to twelve\nAnd then the following week is a section to\nUs again Monday through friday um from nine to twelve so it's a nice hefty filler um you know you can drop your child right at the store at nine a ruse will have full control of the fourth or fifth and sixth graders um that's the age group are looking for entering those any of those grades or this coming September\nI'm now is this just for brand new ... what if somebody has a child that has a little bit of knitting experience do you find that this would still be appropriate for them it sounds like there's an awful lot you're going to teach them\nYes I think it would be appropriate for 'em that age group said just ten to twelve roughly going into fourth fifth and sixth grade whether they know it or not and we'll figure it out or when the first\nYou know our two who knows what and then I'll find something that'll challenge to those who already can that\nAre at the same time on teaching the most basic ... too\nWell and we're learning\nWell enough to all your years of teaching in the elementary school I'm sure you you have a a great next for I'm meeting each child sort of where they're at skill wise and keeping it interesting for those who might be a little bit more advanced\nYes yes I think I can do both of those things\nYou can do anything in terms of crochet at all or is it all just shining no\nWe don't I crochet it's not my strength [laughter]\nWhere do you do it but I think knitting is complicated enough and I don't want to make it too difficult it's supposed to be a camp right and it's supposed\nTo be fun so we're planning on starting with a little group meeting and ending with a group meeting I have some camp songs that I've written um and I think we're we're going to try to keep the light we will have a break in the middle of the morning and snack and ah it'll be fun\nYeah I'm looking forward to I've missed having the camp at the store it brings a completely different vibe for those two weeks\nI'm you know the summer brings a different side to the store in general but it's so great when the kids are in the house and are are in the store I should say\nUm it it just you know adds a level of excitement and a fund fund to Web so we're really looking forward to it now for those who are interested or you can register for the camp on line at Yahoo dot com just go to

the newspapers and on line\nA would just say noted with ... and then there would be a repeat of its ... of these tweets and\nWhatever barbaric thing he said and then in noted it would be the list of all the Republican leadership and how they responded and obviously they hardly ever respond to them that would just be blank space and then the media would concentrate\nIts resources its people on doing more investigative work on what in the world is happening behind the scenes while Trump is you know waiting to shiny objects that the media just can't help but comment on and I have been\nA part of this and I think that no that has to win\nSo that was that's my idea if I were the the the editor of an on line a media that's what I Would do I just would stop with this you know oh he said this and now he said that oh my goodness he's attacking these people either talking those people is this a surprise of course not\nYou know when Jeff Zucker the head of CNN criticized Trump and Sarah ah

what do they do they pay for her gasoline they just surprise her now in this in this era as an any are actually for a one never mind to black guys approach a white woman\nThat could set off all sorts of violence\nBut this ended really well and then this reminds me yeah most people in this country are good decent people is basically these very small tiny but extremely loud minority\nThat believes

best chefs and a and and I don't even know the ... was it was like I was always scolding people it's like why why do first of all why would somebody do that to somebody else\nObviously the people who are on that program\nThey need to get something out of being on that program to help them and their careers so they have to put up with this white guy who school to them\nAnd then and if they're not ready to be on the program if they make you know basic mistakes in the kitchen like that or I don't I don't know whatever those mistakes are then why don't they prep them before they get on the

Smith show where every week we hear from business owners about sometimes the business that they are planning that they are just planting the seeds and that is\nWhat's happening today with my guest Gerardo ... who has a company that is based in Holyoke called green growers and we'll see wouldn't Holyoke green growers Holyoke Rene growers okay Holyoke Rene growers got that right\nSo welcome to the show thank you and so let's talk about your business um you know had I had joke that you know Holyoke nickname was paper city and now they're going to call it rolling paper city one of these days [laughter]\nThere there are several contenders for who's getting into the cannabis business including you so what is your thinking\nWell I'm being\nTwenty four years in Holyoke, Massachusetts and um I used to have a coral business back in the days and I used to grow coral also used a real kind of was before I Try to I jump into the wagon and I decided to apply for economical and publish it to get from that and I was going through a commission\nYou ... for like fish tanks and so yes uh-huh\nThat's like right now um and then we got us up that we are we got the certificate fun to see see see\nSo that's usually the first step but somebody wants to get well\nMost people got the certificate where people who are well disproportionate it by the federal and state laws\nThat were an active back in the days and I'm a lot of the people got arrested or got in trouble or there'll be living in Holyoke for you know more than ten years uh-huh\nOkay so how does that certificate hope you and your business\nA death certificate what he does is it put our um obligation running from everybody else uh-huh so let's say you have an obligation and the company and you apply and um today and we'll probably next month I'll put us in front of the life\nSo it's sort of a combination of affirmative action and making enterprise zones correct yeah okay so okay so you have that certificate and then there's several other certificates and licenses you need\nTo get 'em there's a wandering and wants to get that were given in a in a believe the ... if I'm correct is won or who wants to forget that were given by the CDC in different towns as areas of the state of Massachusetts\nAnd I'm white and now we have to do is find funding and then submitted a um community hosts agreement mhm in the city Holyoke and after that then we have to go to the city and you know once are no\nObligation process is approved by the city then was the ... right so that could I was ...\nAnd and approved by the city the correct me if I'm wrong but it's something like that they give you something that says they don't object that strict uh-huh so that's their approval was later in the ...\nThat ... that will want to see the plans ... how do the ... of the uh excess kind of is the highest product all\nThose all the industrial requirement astray 'cause it is a factory yes it is yeah so um what got you interested in joining the cannabis a market it's such a an intense competition right now when nobody knows where it's going to end up well what got me interested\nIs a let's put it this way uh I used to grow corals to make money so I can restore the reef mhm\nUm and I couldn't make a lot\nWell what got me interested as a let's put it this way I I used to grow corals to make money so I can restore the reef [laughter] uh and I couldn't make a lot of money going on growing corals meant people are not breaking the risk that is correct that is correct\nBut um I Want it to be able to restart it away if I did it in a ... cautions Rico and I you know planted some corals and locations of where I grew up in like I'm a Puerto Rico has\nBeen there and the whole place yeah and um I decided that I Want it to the kind of is it gives us a lot more revenue and I can help the disproportionate impact that community of Holyoke by moving jobs and taking some of that funds and helping the community\nSo you you chose candidates but your purpose is to do good in society\nOh absolutely that's the main goal I Want to be able to help or programs like this park program Holyoke which I Am a graduate from uh-huh and um\nWith this business yeah you took the idea of through spark a like an incubator that's right and that is correct on the canvas for laws\nI learn a lot of spy on how to manage a business how to you know just the whole forward and go for it and has he said what you want right and then um I Want to be able to help that a type of programs in the city Holyoke\nUm because they help or minorities you know achieve businesses yeah basically they are empowerment mhm power in the community in the city the minority community\nOf right right so what business lessons did you get if I might may repeat what you said that you're not only grew coral but you have grown cannabis in your life yes not not in the free market a of today's legal cannabis but what business lessons are you taking out of that cannabis growing\nPeople who use kind of as you said in the middle of the aggressive ah so ah I don't think we're going to go down to ... I think\nThey usually lose to alcoholics though\nOr in fights well that's true yeah but then again ... ... you know I mean I you know they become dangerous my driving you could kill somebody of viewing ... I haven't seen that person was a pair of ... and\nYou know driving down the road swing left and right and so I I don't think we're going to the other two I think we already went on that too but I call\n[laughter] okay so let's get back to you were describing you're describing how you're going to be in greenhouses on what is now open land somewhere a secret location\nAre you worried about crime because even though it might be much more affordable and legal or how are you going to prevent people breaking in and stealing all your cannabis plant\nWell we have in place of security plan already ... and a security plan includes a tool fences ... won a fence a sixteen foot a feat\nIndex cheerio with a multi in between health and yes\nNo water and not just of a sudden somebody try you know that the climate these days people break it into a you know places where the car and drive and everything they can we intend to prevent that in the ... that's right yeah and uh we intend to have a security officer which we have a police officer retire from Holyoke uh-huh\nUh which is a great men and um he was going to manage our security yeah so we're going to have cameras um to secure their ... times connected to the police department in case they see something wrong they will have access to a facility\nSo I Know in the world of medical marijuana or you know they kind of divided up into the uh\nCity vote which is more stimulating and then the IndyCar which is more as my sister close in the couch a relaxing and then there's hybrids and some have medicinal you take this for insomnia you take this for irritable bowel syndrome as recreational going to have all of those distinctions are just going to be more about getting high\nA district will be able to assist in ... I'm a crowd of marijuana grower will take prior to have it all those distinctions on his products and that's why we intend to do intend to grow up to eleven different strains we have three different strains that we have a diehard selves\nAnd what we want to do is we don't take those strange when you buy the product is going to have a level of stating how much ... much yeah CBD and everything that was what is good for and walking right away\nBut of course you're gonna have to go by the specifications of whoever you're supplying like around here um there's a lot of people that grow like barley and Ronnie and things that go into liquor or beer\nAnd if they are lucky enough to sell to Sam Adam Sam adams says this is exactly what you need to grow you following the quality standards of your son\nAnd if they are lucky enough to sell to Sam Adam Sam adams says this is exactly\nWhat you need to grow you're following the quality standards of your supplier or of your customers\nYes I'm just so you know we're not going to have just any regular Driehaus uh-huh agree houses are worth a million and a half dollars these are or something a little angry houses which is basically\nTemperature control ... so we're going to go to the whole month growing all twelve months grown up the year and we're going to have a crop basically every year that way and yeah the three houses I mean not every year every month we're going to have a corrupt right oh we're going to have three houses\nHave rotate crop every day\nSo just to change the topic a little bit so now you said you're looking for basically investors you look at it or people who are going to want to return on investment and want to know what you were timeline is and all the things that would go into them investing in you or Walmart or Arab defense or anything so\nRight now right now we're Elsie so we're looking for punish it we want to find people who now they just have the money but they can contribute to the company and being involved in the company\nAh we're looking for a local people because I Believe that in Massachusetts this this has been on for the people of Massachusetts you know what I mean you got all this other companies coming in from Colorado California and then there's now a lot of people from Massachusetts\nTaken advantage of this I knew a company in Holyoke years ago that well they were going to move out of Holyoke and then the past mayor and past economic development director basically said if you stay in you hire X percent of all your people will give you these tax breaks are you going after anything like that\nAll yes on months I Will watch them and I find we're going to hire mostly people from ... ... ... and our business partners to I'm going to have the opportunity to work in the business mhm but we were on a\nTrain them in the industry off the train every ... every I'd have to go to a rigorous training to me that we have supply quality a fat\nSo are there now industry specifications or certificates for somebody who is a good pot farmer\nYes there is a program who is being developed a a HCC who do this on a train you know how they use who wants to work and kind of is that we tend to us you know\nWork with them oh yeah ... yeah\nAnd even I saw that a a major law firm dotted won't promote because they didn't pay the station or anything for that in Springfield is now opening a special cannabis law division so it really is getting official\nI her son than that but I never know Doug yeah I'll say later my information yeah yeah\nSo what about the idea of it still federally against the law and you can't really have a bank account with your money's\nWell I did find a solution for that there is a bank is called a federal credit union who is looking to um a step kind of money you have to go to a very rigorous process to approve of where the money's coming from that's why you have to have a pass it\nTo them on the street or actually to tell her\nA ... ... to that question I was getting so so um you know like a drug passing no not I'm not an\nOkay I'm just kidding so yeah so that's so the banking problem at least this coming up with some creative solutions and that is right that is\nRight is a program called safe harbor for yeah ... yeah\nAnybody else that could check it out so you know nobody really knows how this was going to happen you can't compare it to a Amsterdam or something like that this is the United states in each state has a different culture I heard years ago a couple of years ago that the price is going to drop so much that it's going to be given away for free and sugar packets in restaurants\nI heard that too but I Do believe that the regulations I mean that could be a stop 'em and that's the idea of me growing on greenhouses because I have a cheaper products and income paid with a big company mhm\n[noise] so if you have a cheaper product would your pitch to a customer be you can buy it for less than sell it for the same or that you can under cut them on the retail level\nNo we're not going to do anything it that way I was saying we want to do a wholesale uh-huh okay let's say a manufacturing yeah buy from us yeah seems we'd go an outdoor the price of the kind of a door I mean we're going to do outdoor or indoor and greenhouses right um the indoors more expensive to grow you have better quality yes I used\nA few less overhead yeah right exactly and then on the green houses you have less overhead mhm and then you have a less you know\nPerfect product and now to make perfect 'cause it can be perfect if you know what you're doing but I mean the price has reduced a little bit yeah so then say you could be able to buy a matter of fact you your products that are far kind of it and then you can sell that yeah I Know\nMy ... and then I Know this is like an odd example but once I knew was still know strawberry grow around here\nThat was saying big why will take everything I can grow of organic strawberries but they want a mass quantity fifty two weeks a year and since I Can't provide that they don't want to buy from me so how do you get that quality and quantity up to the point that you can be a\nRegular supplier by hiring the best growers ... alright and use in um certain products we got 'em grow organic ... which is going to be big a lot of companies are using all kinds of federal ... says we want to use all natural organic product\nUm we do have a\nFew uh interests are already on a company who wants to buy all of our product that Israel and ... on that yes they they want to because they why is it a more local or one of the level\nYou know as local we want to work with all the local people so we can help them too yeah but we also a way of looking to we have to try to look to work with some of the big companies but we haven't got her yeah\nSo do you think that there's going to be a\nAn attraction to local inorganic in this industry like there is with everything else\nAbsolutely because a local guy make me you're not putting all those chemicals into you know it's not a license right of the kind of even though the kind of have to go to a very rigorous testing you know sure you don't have the heavy metal pesticides some the size and all that stuff so that's why we have\nA on a plan we're going to grow and the greenhouse and it's going to be completely\n... great so\nSo Gerardo just in the time remaining how does somebody who's listening to the show get involved with your company\nA yes they can um go to our website W. W. W. dot Holyoke green growers dot com you saw a Greg with yes you have to [laughter] and all that can email or email us at a married Jay uh-huh at holy agreeing drawers dot com all called me up for one three ... three Ninety six okay let's answer and\nSo there's still good old Mary J even though which now has all these other fancy names that's right yeah okay that's great well I Wish you all the best and um they you come back in five years and talk about how you're buying up all the Colorado companies in the in Massachusetts\nI probably gonna go ahead and buy property in Holyoke and fix it and it looks like the city grading okay I Love Holyoke so me to best of luck to you and and you know that city okay great you know this is the western mass business show if you own a business in western mass and you have a story to tell\nMy sister came up with a good joke that if you're on a boat and you get a christening does that mean you hit the baby over the head with a bottle of champagne give credit where credit's due sometimes my sister's actually funny\nThere was some champagne there\nWasn't really champagne or was it like the patriots and the uh read I don't know I don't like ... ... California sparkling wine you drink what is it ... [noise] basically like chocolate milk with the girl a tiny bit of alcohol in it\nI didn't even have any of those away what did you have\nAnything at a diet Pepsi or coke oh my God you and President Trump sorry [laughter] doing the patriots corresponded my dad can I go back to sleep a year or so you were all you were so chipper you don't sound our lives in a in a way for you don't sound tired\nTired who the New England patriots plan next week the Buffalo Bills Monday Night oh God\nI hate that I did all the red Sox game oh nine of solving\nEvery single one of them is that eight or nine for eight Fifteen I'm not going to sleep for like a week and a half\nYour life you will I Will do well I'm going to I Want to watch these games oh good Steve the hippies favorite team the Dodgers are\nPlaying our team the red Sox so this is one way of saying I forget the Dodgers saying\nThey have a saying they have every team has a theme for the ... the red Sox was do damage yeah let's look at Google Dodgers beam I don't know if you want me to the the fly though the the hippies day why get anything as far as one of my mother in the background\nShould never shuttle so is that what it is I don't know we'll have to say the she really she really the one who knows what's going on yeah she's a quiet one of the nose all stuffed yep\nDoes ... mean to sleep new Clemens to sleep in what language finish which I finish\nI rarely began it from the language that has spoken in Finland\nUh my name is ...\nI'm from Turner's falls Massachusetts\nThe exhibit is called the ... is that the green field and galleries exhibit called that because it's a collection of works that I made while I listen to someone\nFor months in the summer and it was accepted at a art residency in the countryside the whole idea of this program is just that it's a month long span of time for you to just work on your art and so there's no obligation for having a concept to begin with\nOr leaving with anything finished is just timing or into thinking play\nYou didn't have to leave with anything finish I did not have to leave with anything centers Monti\nWhat's it like as an artist to have this dedicated amount of time you know most artists are making their art while having to do a million other thing yeah so now you are an artist but your work here at the Greenfield gallery you work in Seymour and that's what your heart life is like in the pioneer valley but you can go to Finland and you just get the things are for months\nIt feels really incredible creatively and psychologically just because here when I make art you know I find time to go to the studio it's after work which means that I first have to kind of climbing to the right space psychologically to work on something\nAnd then they only have so much time before I have to climb back out and rejoin society and my obligation so it never feels quite\nFree but in ... it's just there was a\nMeditation room so I Would meditate every morning and I would just walk into my studio make art and that night I go to bed\nAnd to sleep thing to sleep yeah so why is that the name of the exhibits the project is based on a tree and I had about three weeks before I left her Finland once I knew that I was going to\nGo to this program I knew that the project as going to work on would have to do with grief and loss loss I didn't know what shape that would take and I woke up from the stream and this was the project or what was in three\nWell the dream as we can see here on the wall the pieces are very much about the human form and about\nPlant matter it's kind of has this conversation as the plant's growing out of lens or the lens segue into plants I still don't really know what the dream was about it's more that I woke up with these images I think it just very much about the biological\nAspects of our bodies like we are going to die we're going to go back into the earth we're going to feed plants if we're going to finish we're going to finish\nMuncie it's just a life cycle and so it's just this whole conversation between us and nature\nSo tell me about the process photographic ink transfer print with embroidery you had been doing a lot of photography but what's the ink transfer aspect\nOf cell and you can see I mean these are ultimately based on photographs so I took all of the\nPictures here but when I started working on this project everything in digital photography is just to perfect the technology is so great that everything is Chris and perfect and not dream like at all and a resident who was there with me at that time just happened to show me the same transfer process you know it\nAnd perfect and not dream like at all and a\nResident who was there with me at the time just happened to show me this and transfer process you know it has its final effect as being greedy and\nImperfect it kind of just took me where I had to go with it how does it work well it's a very simple process and there will be a workshop on it actually on Saturday if anybody's interested in coming but\nWhat you do is you have your image and you flip it backwards in photo shop and you print it out on a laser printer it has to be a laser printer ink jet won't work and once you have your print you put it down on the paper you want to transfer it to or a piece of wood or the wall like anything that has kind of a poor as smooth surface\nThen you take a ride that's been soaked in Turpin tie in or winter green oil and you start putting the oil onto the back of the sprints until the print starts coming through and then you can take a spoon or ... or any just burnish the hell out of the back of this piece of paper\nSet the ink goes from the sprint onto the surface he wanted to go through the winter green smell better than the turban time it does and it's non toxic when they first brought this and hear the room smelled like winter in oil\nIs like a giant lifesaver\nComing up more with Turner spoiled artist on your shirt on how she ran around naked in the course of Finland to create this project and how ... photo project of news in response to the candidacy of Donald Trump is once again in

Center for food policy and obesity\nWe've done some national study is really following people over a decade and leaves the that report that white discrimination are increasing\nWe also see evidence of this and other types of experimental studies that look at public attitudes towards people that have obesity and compare those to the same kinds of studies that were done forty fifty years ago and we see that attitude their worst\nPool says obesity bias who's based on a persistent misconception held by the thin end obese are like that a person's weight is entirely their own responsibility so they can be blamed if they're overweight\nBecause these kinds of messages aren't challenged in our society people who are struggling with wait sometimes internalize those types of messages and blame themselves for the stigma that they can find\nAnother reason is because if we look at our diet mentality that we had our country and that's really reinforces the idea that body weight is temporary is infinitely malleable that a person can have whatever kind of body they want if they just work hard enough to lose weight\nYou'd think that doctors would no that's not true that they know the science showing that way it is complicated and governed by a whole host of factors studies show that doctors mirror the rest of society there is so much\nThe prevailing biases in our culture which have long been to associate obesity with things like laziness and gluttony and frankly that's just falls\nI think that tends to be shared with physicians just because physicians are part of our culture so if we've got prevailing biases they tend to affect everybody but if they are compounded in medical practice it's the frustration of I think what we can only call impotence feeling like you're supposed to be able to help and you're not really very good at helping\nAnd nobody likes those kinds of in passes and eventually that frustration kind of takes over and we tend to behave badly\nIn fact Dr David Katz sometimes apologizes to patients on behalf of the medical profession cats is director of the Yale Griffin prevention Research Center at Yale University and founder of the true health initiative\nIt's important to look around and recognize she this is affecting not just a lot of people but a massive majority of people in modern culture and not just in the U.S but around the world\nThis has to be something bigger than individual willpower or personal responsibility those things matter but pandemic obesity in the modern world\nCan't be a lot that we have no evidence to suggest that the modern generation of adults to say nothing of children as less native personal responsibility than every prior generation it's not even plausible that seven year olds are suddenly less personally responsible these days\nPersonal responsibility than every prior generation it's not even plausible that seven year olds are suddenly less personally responsible these days and yet we have massively higher rates of obesity in adults and children alike\nYes as the doctors obesity bias is likely to show up in one of two ways\nOne would be to ignore the issue altogether and the problem with that is that obesity really is a canary in the coal mine of chronic disease you gain the weight before you become insulin resistant and develop type two diabetes you gain the weight before access at a post tissue\nCauses systemic inflammation which contributed to the risk of heart disease cancer stroke dementia every bad thing\nSo it's an early warning indicator on patients dashboard and we want doctors reacting to it but if you're biased against it if you feel and pretend to do anything about it if you feel it's really the patients business to take care of their weight if you don't view it as a legitimate medical concern\nYou just don't talk about it all and I've seen that happen many times over the years\nKatz says the alternative may be even worse winter Dr ... monitoring finger and lectures the patients\nDon't you realize that being so heavy is bad for you you should do something about it as if\nIt were that easy and of course we don't do that with hypertension and we don't do that with coronary disease don't you realize that coronary diseases bad if you just clean out your coronary arteries for crying out loud to you know we don't do that we accept that many chronic diseases have major lifestyle factors affecting them\nIf not directly responsible for them\nBut we don't blame patience for them but with obesity we tend to so when you wag that admonishing finger and blame the victim you pretty much never help anybody lose weight but you do make them feel about an inch tall\nSchools studies show that four men the difference in how they're treated doesn't come until they're about Seventy five pounds overweight for women doctors obesity ... much sooner when they're only about Thirteen pounds overweight so millions of women know what's coming when they make an appointment\nThey know when they go to see the doctor that there are a larger fatter person they know that the doctor knows that the patient make some assumptions in some ways that the doctor will have a bias against that the doctor knows it the patient knows it really kind of ends up making a\nSkewed awkward communication right for almost from the get go\nMuch Cathy cater a psychotherapist in Saint Paul Minnesota who specializes in body image eating in weight issues including white stigma\nSo many of my patients have really become really very phobic about having to go to the doctor because oh well I'll just tell you a little story a patient was working with just a while ago needed to get a new physician and actually the reason that she had her going was that she'd had a pain for war on her foot\nIt all came out of a patient patients making comments in focus groups\nThat they really felt like the gallons that we use to made them embarrassed to have conversations with people because they felt like they were kind of seen through and then they hated walking anywhere in the hospital and it's really important for them to get up and walk to start the healing process\nImproving the quality of hospital gown could even help prevent post hospitals syndrome a condition that leaves patients unsettled and weakened after being discharged\nBeing able to have a gal that\nAllows you to kind of feel like a person again this is so important I think a great example I like to talk about\nIs the color of gal so historically\n... a pretty hideous prints one piece of feedback we heard from patients was right now we don't feel like we're part of their recovery process the treatment process we don't feel like well but see\nSo what will new hospital gown look like Mullen says she asks her graduate students for ideas sort of a contest with patients that judges\nTo down that one was a gallon that wrapped around so it kind of worked like a rap dress\nAnd if those people who don't know what a rap dress does is it covers the front wrapped around the back and then comes back around the front again and tires on the side and these students\nCame up with this idea that Ayn darker color or something that was a little\nBit less trans parent as well as a little bit thicker fabric and the wraparound design would be the best for helping patients feel respected and modest\nMowing finds that new gown designs don't benefit just patients but the hospital staff to\nOf the things that was really interesting about the research really was the fact that\nHospital staff to one of the things that was really interesting about that research really was the fact that the nurses felt so much more like they were getting warm and caring and comfort that was really surprising finding\nSo if the old school gallons are so bad why are they stuck around so long maybe just inertia change is on its way\nOne common misconception I guess is that\nHospitals don't want to change and that hospital like a gal that they currently have one thing that we've been really causing way I don't want to say surprised 'cause we kind of knew hospitals do you want to change with the other products they read it but the one thing that I've really been been really impressed by is\nHow many hospitals really passionate and excited about a damn about moving forward\nAnd making a change and I think that kind of goes to show just outright industry is renovation and how how ready prepared conditions are also to make a difference\nIt's a process and like I said hospital gallons have unlimited life cycle [noise] I don't have that number in front of me that if memory serves that devout it's fine to sixty five washing [noise]\nIf you think about it hospitals over time could get rid of their older gallons and replace them with the newer gallons you don't have to just all of a sudden one day say today is the day we no longer use the old counts you can say is that

you pay now for insurance is the ZIP Code you live in at least with some insurers I'm going to give you advice how to counteract that or benefit from it\nRight now though I Want to talk about something that is an issue for your wallet is the economy has gotten better\nAmericans in larger numbers are buying\nProducts from name brand manufacturers instead of private label store brands and the manufacturers of heavily advertised consumer goods are feeling like wow\nThis is the first time in forever\nThat people are buying our stuff even at higher prices\nTo the point now Proctor and gamble is raising the price of a lot of its stuff five to ten percent think of things like head and shoulders shampoo they make dawn detergent oh lawyer moisturizer and they're just one brand name products company Proctor and gamble makes a lot more things than that\nBy the way a diapers or big with them toilet paper paper towels that goes on and on and on and so those brand name items\nFor the first time in a decade or really moving up in price and the quantity sizes are shrinking with a lot of products at the same time is what you pay if the checkout is going up\nAnd so this time right now is the strongest in probably a decade\nFor the argument that I make that you should buy private label or store brand instead of buying the brand name because I mean who's money isn't it's your money\nAnd so I'm very experimental\nWith private labels and I tried different ones and we accept or reject based on a basically a collection of opinions within the family\nTeeth are so that's another part\nIn very uncomfortable painful what she was saying is you can't close her upper and lower teeth so that's another part important part of the or is it on a process that\nHurt or to really address you know when you're not seeing a patient in person is not just straightening their teeth\nBut a lining their case study sit together comfortably when the patient close to their mouth or you know anything like that that might require a dance treatments or or other load allergies to address it's just a lot harder to pick up on when you're working remotely with these companies\nWell I appreciate that perspective very much and you know we've had a lot of strong feedback from people and the dental industry\nAnd that uh that it doesn't at all share the full story when I talk about people doing this and why they're doing and how much money they're saving that you've got a perspective it's very clear that people can have harm\nWhen all they're trying to do is straightened their teeth that the consequences can be more severe than they realize thank you for sharing your listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] an official methods for Medicare open enrollment ends than so

time anyway so\nThose things how I drive you'd think that would be how it would be determine what I'm going to pay but that credit score is going to be giant with many insurers and the ZIP Code oh little giant so for you\nShopping around where you already know what kind of driver you are you just need to quote the same level of coverage is that you have now and by the way raise that the doctor but when you go to shop typically do a thousand dollars\nYou may say hey what am I going to do I don't have a thousand dollars if something goes wrong well here's the thing you make small claims on auto insurance\nYou now have a mark of shame it makes it difficult for you to shop around and is likely to lead to big increases in their premiums you pay with who you're then stuck with\nSo you want to use auto insurance when you've got something relatively bigger that you have to deal with not something relatively small because they'll burn you when you make that small claim it's worse even with homeowner's insurance\nBut you raise that the doctor bill and if you\nHave a lot of assets you own your home free and clear which like a third of people do you've got things that are of value\nJoan

person smiling who'd been injured in an accident and the billboard the person's talking about how some lawyer got um six hundred and sixty thousand dollars and they're smiling ear to ear\nPeople out there like that so make sure\nThat if you got stuff\nYou've got enough liability insurance and if you got a lot of stuff meaning money\nIn your own stuff free and clear you want to look into an umbrella which sits on top of your regular coverage\nAs additional liability very cheap to buy for what you get sold in increments of one million dollars of additional protection for you in the event somebody is able to hold you responsible for something that went wrong\nAnd their lives and they don't have to\nNecessarily show that Europe fault they just have to convince the insurance company is not worth their time to defend you and they just start handing out checks\nJason joins us on the car coward show Hi Jason\nHey Clark how're ya\nGreat thank you Jason you've got money hanging out all over the place\nI I Do and I and I need some help them to know what to do with it\nAll right let me see if I can help these are good problem sad by the way\nYes sir what so I've got I've got a I've got two\nDifferent for all and K accounts um from two different companies I work for in the past um one is currently sitting about Eighteen thousand and some change and the other one around seven thousand um\nCourse in the longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer four one K. so I guess the question is what do I do with this money to ...\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small we're in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nWell the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right\nSo I was scared that all that money out quickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments\nOkay than we have them let me tell you how many do not call the\nAdministrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do\nIs they would serve track thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you ... and send it to the IRS as withholding\nAnd you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then and you recommend an IRA or the Ross\nIraq I'm now you have to I just want to hear you talk about now that it's\nAll right so the story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill 'cause all that money that was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay\nAnd you can over time migrate the money from the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday Now let's talk about the other one the seven thousand\nIs that in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo is a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave that seven behind and move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... through great questions so let's say let's keep the simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple um move both of them to pay on guard and an IRA and just be done with the old employers for one case because if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway\nAnd then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there\nAnd then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions to you all have the twenty five to grow in the vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions you may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis'll be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA\nNew money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHi Clark is taking my call\nSure you've got a

spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so if I could live dependence and myself the premiums would

that Clark dot com that walks through this fine process\nAnd one of the thing about transportation I keep forgetting that mentioned Hoover and left are offering free rides on election day\nIf you

doing\nI'm doing great thanks how are you are too\nYes I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer that question\nCould they may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security at a sixty two and possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount at a later age I feel like with the right of investment you probably wouldn't be doing better off than waiting\nTill a sixty six and four months so it seems like an old chunk of change\nYour life and the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nWith stun or is it what investments earned today what savings are in today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the putative advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment as base for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to do\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing ... so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to line right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know at age I'm going to take it where you know eight\nEight Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products may extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to ah hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it so you gave the ah you gave the analogy\nOf sixty two and your retirement age would you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nI plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm\nStill feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's gonna stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to deliver in years to regain the money that I like to go at sixty two\nCompletely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefit now let me tell you the risk I'm taking\nWe may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother in January my oldest brother ... will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know that we are not a genetically disposed to live long as guys in my family so can you imagine I'm going to wait till late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nA mother that's over Ninety and she's still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there's a direct advantage to waiting because what you really concerned about is way down the road\nSo I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited 'til age Seventy that he ends up moving a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money\nNo but was with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\n... ... talk to you I'm a big fan well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company what did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit

that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by the ... that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if\nIt would be in my best interests that I guess in my credits best interests I close the cart\nBefore then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere's no real advantage to you having that if you have you have sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard's American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nBecause I ... I Would dump it just let them just let them kick you the curb in December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is\nLooked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending\nTo use it again so let it just walk away\nOkay it it did as a feeder MasterCard logo uh 'cause\nThen I went to then I Want you to keep it I should go keep it leaves some purchase somewhere\nOr whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being inactive to an active card okay and then it stays as active and part of your overall credit mix but when it is just\nA ...
