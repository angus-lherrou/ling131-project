economic freedom it freedomworks and author of the book the end of work John it's good to have you on the program again thanks\nA large great to be here thanks for having me on\nYou know the the Federal Reserve gets under people's skin and it gets under my skin as well and there have been times I've heard from people who say let's just get rid of all together and I've I've said well\nI'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean certainly should be reined in but is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last resort in the form of the Federal Reserve because I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\nOh yeah well without question or the fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of for a solvent banks to\nEver go to the fed for alone because to do so isn't the mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal exists to loan to insolvent banks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that\nThe feds also bank regulator but if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job at a real bad as we saw two thousand eight the fed was said had no clue about the problems with and banks and so it can't do a good job there and then it aims to target\nThe overnight rate which banks lend to one another but you know and interest rates are price like any other you don't need the sad for that so I think this notion that the fed serves some useful essential purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice it at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate though do you not that the federal government views them as a way to when the economy starts to heat up\nThat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool it down and in theory\nThere the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold\nThat they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially\nTo try to pump it back up again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effect that has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nAll yeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stressed there is the\nIs that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs buildings or labor most specifically in such a reminder that we create the credit we create the resources that\nPeople are looking to borrow and they borrow money and and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap is as silly as the mayor of Portland saying okay the top of mount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month\nOkay will demand for for those rentals would be high but supply would be non existent the fed can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can heat up the economy and slow it down I don't take very seriously\nSo is there an and I don't either because you know all the way through from away when the\nInitial you know are we fell off the edge of the cliff now all the way to June of nine one officially the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they weren't credit Obama with fixing the uh you know the the recession and I say really\nHe fixed it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing you didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly\nAnd they say well you know you fix the economy well he didn't but their idea was will drop the interest rates low enough to zero or or even below zero so that will pump the economy back up again clearly\nYou didn't do over eight years what Trump is managed with regulatory reform and tax reform over just a couple of years so I don't buy that one either one of the best way than to sort of back down and start to dismantle this uh you know this role that the\nFed has if we can get the political will to do that and speak to that too if you don't mind\nWell let's let's hit on a couple of those things is is that are crucial for one the recession was the sign of the recovery\nA recession merely signals and economy cleansing itself the misuse of labor the bad habits developed the lousy companies the badly vestments and so when you get out of the way of the recession your setting the stage for the recovery\nAnd so that's the first thing I Would say a ... a president he has the best thing president can do\nIs just do nothing and then then you have your recovery\nUm in terms of dismantling the fed\nAgain I think you just is you prove why we don't need it the fed can't make credit inexpensive it can't push the rate is zero and suddenly you think that that's way sources oh ... that's going to say the resource ... is anyone thinks the fed can make that so\nNo no more no more than the fed could control the economy by saying well if things are bad let's drop the price of oil to ten bucks a barrel and then the economy will take off like a rocket because gas and diesel will be cheap and that's what the economy runs on no they can't\nDo any of them and say you nail it you hit it on their head so the fed could never say OK oil is going to be cheap now and oil and and make oil plentiful by saying that what the fed would do is get\nJohn I lost you there for justice are going to use away go ahead do you have dropped out for a second\nOh I'm Sorry the fed it the fed is setting the price of oil it and what\n... at our oil scarce they're just wouldn't be any oil by and so implicit in and pushing the interest rate down to zero is that the fed can decree all resources\nNear cost less to access which we know logically it cannot do and so it's natural that said yes statement the obvious what could possibly do to stimulate or help the economy it quite simply\nSex and supporters alike leave so who was who wants to keep it around John\nOh I think you and I know exactly who wants to keep it around the fed is a convenient whipping boy for Congress\nAnd the convenient whipping board for the president any time we have a recession\nWhich is again a sign of an economy cleansing itself of of what's not working Congress want someone to put you in so it was a present oh the fed raised interest rates the fed I credit that get no more credit than then again the fed it could make it difficult to buy oil\nThese prices are set in the market and so we're always going to have the Federal Reserve around because Congress has a constituency in the banking system they want something to prop up what makes no sense during times of stress but they also want someone to play\nAnd so you know I say get rid of the fed makes serves no purpose I think we all laid out one way or the other four never going to get rid of it is Congress want someone to point to when their policies are working\nWell I I guess and you know you you can only be without an answer John because I uh I ... I'd like to get rid of it and I'd like to know what it would take to incentive are incentivized Congress or if you served the function of belong them a whipping boy looks at them up or\nYou know something that they can beat on every time the economy is doing what their constituents one but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly as kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us [noise]\nUm well look I couldn't agree more uh my second book not plug it is called needs the fed in which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward irrelevant it needs to be shut down but I I add\nIf Congress won't do this\nMarkets are shutting down the fed for us they're increasingly making what makes no sense not very well but but I agree with you I think this should have the courage\nTo say we don't need this and in fact if it serves any purpose at all it serves a purpose that weakens overall economic activity that weakens the banking system that that it delays recoveries that our rights that our our our right\nRealize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer\nIn New York is out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five\nPistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man and just keeps going and he just knocks them down and you know it's a really remarkable is your story as it sounds ... kills twenty eight men\nBut they did about ten years ago they went back to Oregon and the battlefield archeology on the spot that that\nYou know York made this this incredible uh stand if you will and they found a forty five cartridges over forty of them along with is thirty six ammunition\nIn that exact spot and and you wrote that as you went you know he told his men because this is a guy's you said mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed\nAnd are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie you know it was an old movie is not very ... if I remember right who was Gary Cooper in black and white was in it\nIt was it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie it's worth you know where's the beef visiting yeah you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's a great movie\nSo he's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers you're dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine guns in the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked it down and he said\nAnd then you said he went right down the position points is forty five but the Germans hadn't says\nTell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy soldiers stop firing\nThey just stop they stop and it's ah it's incredible they he captures with along with some of the men in his patrol over a hundred and thirty Germans\nAnd they marched them back you know miraculously back to American lines and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday where the commanding general says\nWell York I hear you catch the whole day observing army [laughter] then he sort of lasted obviously I got a few\nI feel a hundred and thirty two and attitude yes this is the kind of story\nThat I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go into the movies and seeing you know stories of the single man or a single woman who couldn't run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story because after I watched the movie and this is a while\nI can read the history of the real history the man when he came back he was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built um a house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy who was it was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and\nAnd he was just a symbol guy was ...\nHe was he didn't want to monetize\nThe experience and I think that that makes them so exceptional\nIt's not you know ... you look at today where people are are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around York didn't want that\nAnd I think that that's what makes in exceptional along with that generation of Americans which ... hundred years later and they're largely forgotten but they're going after them in the unknowns the book I just wrote\nIn and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they change the world\nAnd in fact if if if nothing else I guess maybe he was ... didn't they created a weapon system that was the York\nHere the sergeant

show\nOne of those seven five ...\n[noise]\nOn the wars Lawrence his show which is a disorder talk Radio's loud is strong and the and I appreciate your support\nHonestly say that it's all very big with lawyers are listening to the massive amounts on the\nAnd the Internet to hell with their fears Lars Larson [noise] of what we know\nFor sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh and the second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats are they've always got\nA reason why the goalposts needed to be moved nothing we could do would satisfy them their dug out as\nMitch McConnell and he's right the Democrats are dug in their dug into a position that's looking more and more week\nEvery moment that goes by especially after the FBI report came back\nIt officially arrived at the White House last night arrived at the U.S Senate today it is being closely held sealed in a Mason jar now it's actually in a room where as a U.S senator you have to show the proper ID that you've got the background and all that then they allow UN\nKnow copies of it there is exactly one copy of it at the White House one copy and Capitol Hill\nAnd they're looking at over and here's the well here's at least as much of an indication as we have\nYou know that there are Republicans out there who are a little bit squishy when it comes to things conservative well two out of the three undecided Republicans\nHave already well they look through much of the report maybe not all of it and they have called the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh ... and his accuser Christine Ford\nThey've called a thorough and I think as much as we can tell anything from that if they're saying it's Thoreau and that they now have covered to say well the FBI is looked into it Christine forward gave her testimony a week ago on Thursday of last week\nAnd she was very sympathetic but was she convincing\nBrett Kavanaugh was angry\nAs I think any man would be or woman would be if falsely accused and he was convincing he'd get back up what he said she could not and now after the FBI has delivered its investigation which is the Democrat and said oh I Can't possibly get done in a week\nOf course these are the same Democrats who are totally confident that the FBI could thoroughly review the six hundred thousand emails on congressman Tony wieners laptops remember all that stuff that came to the former congressman because his wife was one of the key right hand people for Hillary Clinton\nAnd he had all those classified emails on his computer and they said no problem will breeze through those six hundred thousand emails\nThey were done in about three days if you could do that in three days\n\nDid you know that you

eight six six halo hours to join the conversation oh welcome back Lars Larson show well we've\nHeard some of the reaction from some of the Senate leadership did say that they\nBelieve that all the Democrats are trying to do now is delay and delay and delay we've also heard that some of those who managed to read the investigation of quick additional background check that was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough and now at this point the Democrats are they are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting is going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nMy friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and former federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on I Want to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background checking and ... those who've read it say the report shows\nThey knew that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford\nWell thanks so much Lars there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin\nAnd that's saying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to collaborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process\nRather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the law you have forty nine Democrats who do not want to have a fifth\nReliable conservative vote on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this\nBeyond the midterms so that\nThe Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and can defeat a cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat Merrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy or in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to tried to impeach him but I I look to the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this for the weekend Lars but there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on that are no longer\nThe kind of norms that you can absolutely bank on I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain that tradition that judges can't be a it can't be impeached unless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abuse simply but\nYou know there's all kinds of norms that we we've had that are no longer you know you you've had two or three generations of students who have been told that norms\nAre basically uh instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and denied their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been to explain my audience and I think you're back me up on those and told me if I'm wrong that if they adapted to an eight member court it would've been fact to be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions of four four and effectively and know it would've neutered the Supreme Court to a large extent\nBut could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing I Would still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think he would because he would just put his head down and continue to do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed\nIs so remote a ... as to be illusory that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrats got an ... majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for months\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy put the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the left or ... dodging America and here's a great example of it but let me ask you a political question\nDo you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn drought today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes as full\nWell I think laws if you look at as I understand it if you look at for example the the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case that the left with Trump in has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against\nTrump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and they usually more than\nA party in power for the ... and mid term elections all all of that energy and enthusiasm so I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and they're frightened by it\nAnd that means that did they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do a name to charge were Dr Ford's name\nHas come out Christine foreign and that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweating it which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage she brings with her and then as they did that\nAnd they started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turn off Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp has come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers that it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was wrong were of a mind to at least credit her good faith that you know was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous\nPeople now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it it turns\nThis whole idea of advice and consent and to search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly be frightened by that\nTwenty almost Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was use I think it will inappropriately to not found a real a real creep\nThere's somebody who really had done terrible things to women\nAnd at that time they said oh you can't engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much of my cost us so we will not do it and I I for the most part I don't think they will Andy thanks for your insights we always value them\nWhere you can ask a follow up questions or\nQuestions should comment time one you

author\nHelen Wilkes says that doesn't have to be the case she wrote her book the aging of Aquarius to inspire her fellow retirees to aim higher because she says retirement has been better to her than expected\nLife kept getting better and better for me\nAnd I kept pinching myself to believe that this was true it was so very different from what I expected and then I started looking around me and realizing that people were actively doing all kinds of things and their life was getting richer and better at a time when they expected to be doing nothing\nAnd it was just so amazing to me that I started to you know just even take notes for myself so that all these amazing people and they grew [laughter]\nJust kept on growing I kept meeting more people and realizing that we have been sold a bill of goods that retirement is just sitting under a palm tree with a drink at our hand or\nCruising endlessly there's so much that people still have to give I don't want to get we feel so much more meaningful and so much better about ourselves when we're getting back to the world in some way\nWilkes says where the improving medicine and extended life expectancies were destined to see more and more retirees looking for new ways to enjoy their lives later on in life\nMost of us will spend a third of our life in retirement and some of us even longer it's going to be the new norm in no time if not already for people to spend as long and retirement as they did in their working life\nForty years if you work from the time you were twenty to the time you were sixty then you're going to be sixty\nHundred people are saying octogenarian in super seniors as they're called are growing astronomically thanks to modern medicine and better health\nCare we know more about diet we know about the importance of exercise we know about the importance of socialization which you mentioned earlier all of these factors\nAre entering into a new world for seniors and for people who are approaching retirement\nWilkes says she felt inspired by her retirement to trying new things that once you stumbled into an old box of letters and was struck by your new parents shouldn't and the second career\nWhen I retired partly I was taking care of my mother who was having some health issues at that point partly also I was wondering who I Am and\nWhat was an finished in my life\nAnd in that context I knew that my father had a box of ... that had come to him when I was a child and I knew of them and my mother had always kept them in a special box when she came to live with me she brought the box and one day I decided to open the box\nAnd it simply turned my life around because I didn't realize\nWho I was in many ways those letters were from people in Europe who had been dying to come to America or to any country that would have them but because they were Jews\nNobody wanted them and I suddenly realized that if I just put all these letters back in the box it would be as if all these people who had spring to life true they're writing was killing them\nAnd it wound up writing a book\nOriginally or just for me and for my family but people encouraged me to reach a wider audience and I was lucky that university press published it they all of this led me to realize that I like the process of writing and have going within\nWays that I had never had an opportunity to do a when I was in the working world\nAnd soda writing has now become one of the things I Love doing\nRoque says or experience of funding this new post retirement crafts for her so doesn't have to be the exception that can be the rule\nRetirement can beat the beginning of a whole new way of life for you and I'm encouraging people to look forward to that way of life that's productive and active rather than just consuming more and more of the world's goods you want music\nGreat when was the last time you took piano lessons you get that as a child so could you do now and if you can't manage a piano maybe you could try something a little easier or some other way but everybody has something\nOf course some people may struggle to find that next great passion or bears Wilkes says that's no problem and she has a few brainstorming questions to help others explore their interests in New ways\nSome of my questions if you knew you couldn't fail what would you do\nIf you knew you could start something fresh without anybody laughing at you or making fun of you\nWhat would you do what voices are you hearing from your past that said ... who do you think you are you're too old for this or what are the voices and the tapes that are playing in your head that are preventing you from living here life fully\nAnd with those questions in mind Wilkes says it's time to take those passions in your own hands and said new aspirations\nI start with piece of paper and a pen [laughter] and not even a device and start writing things down and\nI make long long lists of things that are practical and things that are completely off the wall and\nYou never know where things are going to take you I recently encountered a retired gentleman\nAnd at sixty five year he retired he decided for the first time in his life that he was going to sing in public he had never done it\nHe is now been offered contract as a student in a major Academy of music where he's going to go and developed his voice to sixty five\nMe ever signed a note is life and yet there's a whole new avenue opening up for him\nSometimes retirement can be an isolating experience on our our specialties the jobs people feel give them meaning and going to be the connections people make within their industries\nWilkes says she hopes people can see that as an opportunity instead of a curse an opportunity to make new friends and learn new things\nBefore maturity young people's temperaments and decision making skills can be willfully underdeveloped\nImpulsivity more impulsivity with kids less ability to see in the future meaning to know the consequences of one of the actions that just imagine going into a school in the middle of the day going into a classroom to have a fight I mean who is thinking like that\nYou have

I mean twenty percent of all of the outpatient care is a copayment under Medicare and for the first day of the hospital people pay about a thousand dollars even if they have Medicare so the bills do keep coming in and even for people with Medicare\nFor the rest of us ... says as long as the program as he proved to cover those gaps Medicare for all would take away much of the financial risk of being sick or hurt\nHowever for no two would dictate what's most striking from the study is the impact of illness on the work portion of a person's financial life he suggests that Americans are likely to fall behind economically when they're ill or injured without better sick leave and disability insurance\nIs a big difference that we see in the U.S relative to some of the similar studies that we've come across by people working in Europe for example there's a closely related study in Denmark that find\nSimilar declines in labor income earning but they find that on average a lot of that has replaced by a combination of short term disability insurance paid sick leave things like that\nIn the U.S by contrast we see very few people are able to bring their income back to where it was before in the short term so this ends up being an income declined that isn't really replace\nYou can find out more about all of our guests through links on our website radio health journal dot net you can also find archives of our programs there as well as an eye tunes Institute\nI'm reading and [noise]\n[noise] [noise] coming up how to balance on my radio health journal [noise]\nHere's the story of Laura whom he wants to play with his parents love of the game center to special caps and then in college\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nThe trumpet [noise] [noise]\nYeah I was never that good at football gave up by the time we go to college but he also learned how to get to see them a lot of money on our interests so he switched to say so this your story has a happy ending\nAfter all what a day for tennis you ready to play is everything alright decided that share a liquor dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment in Pakistan\nCelebrity helps you breakthrough congestion fast but like ... and non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free breathing whoa nice Molly not only do you go easy on me\nGet a leg redeemed and give back to the moment starts working in one hour available at the pharmacy counter\n\nThe food we eat contain all kinds of things most of us have never heard of things like the ha P.

right before you planted\nWhat I like to do to add to the reporting is either the day before night before or a couple of days before I'm usually about to max when I Know I'm going to ... somethings even from outside or from inside I like to make sure it gets a heavy soaking\nSo that the water is absorbed into the plant to help with some of that transplant shock it's one of those things just to do a little preemptive help ah when it gets into a new part\nIt's going to kind of have that little shock like what just happened\nUm\nSo I just like to add that extra step keep everyone you were doing perfectly are the same I Would follow that exactly to AT T I just like to add this extra step\nTo make sure that the plant has some extra time to absorb some water because really when it gets into that new part or if you're putting it outside of the new ground it kind of get shocked\nRight you're just helping a little bit to ease some of that shock for moving from one part to another um but follow everything else to a tea um I I trust everything my father said so it definitely was right on that a lot\nLower outlet you you've been you've been very very helpful and and you keep it

hopper or it's such a point where she can barely growing\nSo she got the point where you're starting to take apart the garden others but when it to know is it or they can get you could put down now for next year or something you would recommend for next year\nI when you say ... ... you mean something to uh take care of the insects\nCorrect okay for a while now\nSo there's nothing that kind of preemptively attack for next year around this time um but the good thing would be to do would be to\nReally take care of the soil a little bit because by taking care of the soil ah you're going to promote healthier plants or it's just like you and I wouldn't we're weak or were sick or something along those lines are more likely to get\nA little sick or if you will because we're already weak it's a kind of the same thing with plants are the best thing that she should be doing is really writing all this down figuring out exactly okay this happened at this point this happened at this point and being ready for it um\nWas actually talking to somebody yesterday who really does a works with IBM which has integrated pest management their biggest thing is about preventing a future outbreaks of insects diseases et cetera\nBy doing that or we just you know I talked to a lot he was an entomologist too so it was a lot of great information there\nUm but what he was talking about was preparing for next year and knowing that this is one that's about it happens these are the weather conditions that kind of do it and be a head of it\nThe other thing you can be doing a that she can be doing\nWas right now a lot of the fruits and veggies or sees me a lot of the veggies are starting to to fade away get rid of all the plants clean up as much as the leaves as possible and throw 'em in the compost uh for for next year or just get rid of them whatever whatever they choose to do I'm\nFrom there really start to clean up the soil a little bit make sure that you know maybe the weeds aren't there et cetera what I'd like to see her do I would put it would\nBe to put some sort of cover crop down [noise]\nAh like a winter rye or putting all of that so that it's going to it's going to add to the soil [noise]\nUm I'm about ten seconds from\nGoing to a break on the other side we have a lot more time to talk so hang tight for me like I Want to give you a little bit more information on

club how can we help you\nHow ... how are you I'm doing great how are you\nGood I'm doing All right but I'm a little frustrated because I've got a really nice son sad and I've got iris those daily said it and I love ... so that's a beautiful day and age ... and early just as it was going to really boils some critter ate\nAll the route and just killed it said I looked at the end of the state of theater full flat it was like God\nI'm not the top of the class I mean it just it was ... called that part of the ground that were no black so I had one little ... in another part of that bad farther up and nothing had touched it that was doing well that was a special one\nNow waiting for a ticket figure and about a week ago same thing it looked kind of sad I went over to it\nYou know touched it it was loose I pulled it up you know one tiny little hairy were left on the on the bottom side\nHave you got is there is something I can put in the soil we used to think oh well let's see if we can you describe mail and that will scare them away because they don't like blood or you know some kind of a of a amendment that would\nDiscourage whatever is eating my inclination to not eat it because I live perfect ... for that and I just can't have it right now\nKnow a real quick or you know just seemed like a ton of only type areas where it's like a a bigger like a ... that's the tunneling under there is the soil loose in that area\nI was very loose my on like that are real life ... you know you just think your hands right and so on that's how I make them but ah the um yeah and there's there's chipmunks and all kinds of stuff towels you name it everywhere so I so I'm thinking probably\nMaybe maybe try to around ... ball with with wire or I don't know\nWell so there's a couple of ways you could do it I it sounds like there's you know moles type polls that type of um rodent coming in there and eating the written systems are still I'm Still a thank God yeah right I have\nOne of the things you can be doing is that there's a product right now called ... ...\nAh from bone I um yeah that is something that ... that you place around the areas or to repel them has a distinct smell or in the field or the grandiose uh it's the the rodents don't like them or one of the things you\nCan do on the go ahead\nOh so can I put that in the ground as the ...\nI wouldn't put it in the ground you put it ... around the areas it's one of those things where you put it on the soil um and that that gets it once it gets into the soil it'll actually um scare them away that way um what did like to see you do is\nGo out into the garden and those areas that you kind of that were as you said your gardens already soft but in the areas that are even more soft that you that you remember I Want you to see if there's any holes\nAny tunnels like that and at those holes I Want you to cover all the whole up as ... as soon as possible that they want you to do that tonight don't do it now because the the they're not as active what they'd like to do is they're nocturnal they come at night um\nFor the next morning you'll start to see where the whole active holes are so I Want you to find as many of those holes as possible cover them up step on them and then tomorrow morning or if they do it another night whichever morning go out and you're going to start to see all these little volcanoes in certain areas only\nLife as it happens all the time I just step on\nWell so when it's going to do is buy finding out where those volcanoes are going to find out where they're active tunnels are so you can actually start to repel them away if you're looking to repel them there's that way or if you're looking to just get rid of them completely there is a product called ... a mole talks excuse me\nA that is a ploy snow it's called mold talks are from ...\nFrom bona fide it's a poison what it is is\nUm ... you put it into the soil and the the though actually eat the\nThe poison and unfortunately will pass away I'm a stay away from it or is that like it when it is but it's just difficult for you to it's a rodent a killer so it's definitely for that but by doing that you're already in the whole\n[laughter] oh well that got kittens to\nUm it might that might be something to do with it because they are in the same you know class um so that it would it should do that too if you're worried about you know not getting the chipmunks are now\nI'm I'm perfectly happy with getting along the only thing I'm concerned about it if it you know like we're careful about rat particles we don't want to have some bird of prey con yeah and other\nCrimes and eat like a half\nDead [laughter] we're at and then died because they're eating contaminated animal but when it wasn't the mall all\nSo more Max's your repellent for that area that will um repel them away what\nYou do is you create a perimeter around the bed around the area is um to a\nPush them away as one of the reasons why I wanted you to step on the on the whole so you can find out where they are\nI I've gone to a lot to hold containers of this of this stuff it's a it's a it's a battle because I'll tell you what else like ill and you'll understand as I said earlier it's that I had a limited area where I can put my feet or so I had them along that's parameter of the ... of course\nYeah states that yeah the ground you know everything costs so that so it's not ... ... what is it poison causing all the\nPoison is called ... talks or if you're ... and that type of thing in the area you know might not be the best for you to do or the other suggestion I have for you um is around ... it's more of a natural way to maybe propel it\nUm in those areas instead of using like wire maybe use some ah\nThree quarter to an inch rocks\nOr you can buy like a bag of like dreaming stone or something\nAlong those lines that are hard and center\nYeah plant it kind of around to make that the like the base make it like you were saying using wire use it as the cage\nThat type of thing and planted around there [noise] um [noise] those rodents have a hard time digging through rocks they dig easily through soil but rocks and they can't do so maybe that's one of the things you can do this just as natural\nTo do it and I tried to sue you're breaking up a little bit more going to the break so thank you so much for the phone

issues with if you just leave the hot out there\nLike right over the cat\nWill so they could rot and one of the things that happened being exposed to the elements are you going to freeze thaw fact or instead of being in the ground or bumps usually are\nThey um [noise] the the temperatures and everything are right above it so they'll feel the warm weather a little bit easier than being in the ground still feel the cold weather a little bit easier than being in the ground so\nThat means that if you want to get them outside you can put 'em outside maybe put them in a like a corner of the house on the porch or something along those lines\nAnd then and about you know and then cover um\nWith either some soil around the sides or a salt marsh pay a ... it's highly there I Would wait to do the salt marsh hey if you were going to do it till about a Thanksgiving\nUm because your what your what you do if you put that sell more saying now you're creating a house for rodents they're waiting for shelters are looking for those types of things are so that that's why you would wait a I Would go out and purchase that salt marsh saying now if that's what you're going to do\nLike the salt marsh hey around Thanksgiving nobody's really going to have it they're going to be some garden centers out there that will habit but it's not common at that point everybody's into you know the Christmas trees the points that is that type of thing [noise]\nSo that's why I said yesterday man now for you if you keep it in a on a heated garage in the corner it needs to have that that cold temperature so any point that garage gets heated I Would definitely not keep it in that garage\nOkay now they won't be in a garage sale\nGarage if I like ... ...\nYeah and you don't want to keep it in like an an a location that's going to be sunny I'm getting some indirect light that type of thing you want it to have that dormant see period you want it to you have that cold temperature um bulbs they they that's why we plant so many in the fall\nIt's like I can see that can have that hard to not period to get into blooming for you or to just make sure it's in the cooler area it's not going to get a lot of direct sun that type of thing or should be fine\nOkay what other quick question I\nGuess in a pot\nSo that I Dream my\nGarage\nWell so my question for you as was is it like an outdoor high drain jurors at a high dreams that you got from like around Easter\nEgg something way than I set it on a table at a wedding and I have it outside it's killing beautiful it's got all these bad timing it I Want it to try and save it\nWell so\nThe high drained it needs to go into that dormant period as well I\nYou know it's one of those things where that would be in the ground and tell you that you know planted if you're going to keep it in the pot you could kind of do the same thing with the salt marsh have that type of things okay but that's a little bit more temperament a temperamental than the bumps\nUm 'cause it's exposed on the top as well as its root system\nSo you know you can try to do it on a container um I haven't had much success with containers of only tried it a couple of times I Will say um [noise]\nI bought a a high drained you about maybe two to three years ago I'm\nI'm not going to say where I where I bought it from kind of not proud of worry about it\nUm but\nIt was on super super super sale so I was like I I just want this plant anyways I left it outside I'm In the corner by my porch and\nYou know every year would come back a little bit when look great but this year I looked at it just they had implanted in a couple of years I have two young children there's not a lot of time to do much um but when I when I was looking at it\nIt's actually still growing still fine and I put it up against the the house up against uh the porch so it was protected\nThere are a bunch of other stuff around it uh so it it did have some installations a but it's still live on three years later so I mean I've had success there but I haven't had success on others so it's kind of what I'm saying it's more like a fifty fifty shot when it comes to that but it can be done\nWhich is the blooming uh on the um\nThe around a little high trained is is it because of the winter because I only got like two blossoms and I walk around and filling that I noticed a lot of people don't have a lot of blossoms that share yeah in ... killing that kept [noise]\nYeah so what happens yeah it was definitely because what had happened in February we had some real warm weather um I remember I remember going to work uh in shorts one day 'cause it was Seventy degrees in February and I am and\nAs awesome as it was to go to go into work with shorts on in February it was really bad for plants that temperature change that everything all of a sudden the plant started to wake up\nNow they were starting to feel that whether a and it was it was Seventy one day but the other couple of days around that it was it was warming up\nLike the other problem that actually happened that nobody really talks about they always think of like that ... that hit right after is we had nor'easter after nor'easter but the first I believed I Believe the first nor'easter we had was actually all rain\nAnd so that rain started to uh saw some of the ground\nAnd some of the plant starting to do absorb water so their roots started to wake up\nAnd so that's one of the things that did a lot of the damage that nobody you know it was really seeing a yes and with a lot of high dream is if you cut them back at that point you know the older style high during this they're not going to bloom for you that well this year that year\nThe other thing I noticed was even with those re bloomers like the end the summer high dream job they were having some issues uh ... those are the types that you can\nNot proven on old and new would\n... so you can you know it doesn't matter you can come back at during the middle of the summer and be fine but I noticed that happened with those as well so I think what really happened is it it just the weather did a lot more damage than we thought it did\nUm you know it was one day and then it rained and then it snowed so you know my father always said the snow was poor man's fertilizer\nWell we got to just too late so it was like that so that's one of those things where the high during this took a hit this year I'm I've been getting a lot of questions and calls about it or even at the garden center\nWhere I Am [noise] I work at ... and Winchester we're getting a lot of those questions as well [noise] uh so\nThank you very much for me than they do and it got\nDiane thank you so much for the call\nAnd I enjoy the rest of your day [noise]\nI

A. C. C. the audience poker now gentlemen have a question coming in for you for mister Kenny on the whole family to do today and uh Kenny actually has to question first how did the song victors poke his sneakers come to beat\nAnyone anyone\n\nUm I thought the story went that possibly sharing and Roger come up with their versus toured or something on his side you have the Victor ... that's right and now you say the rest of it okay\nAh I I really want you to be more active on the microphone this morning belief at any rate [laughter]\nAh yes\nThe answer that's civically it goes back to a fan of ours by the name of Victor ... these are great individual who followed the brass for many many years\nAnd so he was a great dancer he like many of the dancers years ago\nWould get totally stoking because of dancing and with different partners and so he ever all of these great dancers used to bring different close to change once they're soak in and so on so forth\nAnd so Victor a dear friend who was beaten who became a very dear personal friend\nSharon wrote the words to poke at two victors poke his sneakers\nOnly because victory had these old beat up sneakers and she thought wouldn't it be nice to do that Roger helped out what a melt mentally and so that's how that\nSong came about victors focus sneakers now Kenny other question for all three of you is did you have a favorite song to perform live with the brass\nMm Ricky\nNot really I mean I I enjoy so many of them I I Can't even think of one particular one\nWould pick oh no I I agree with him we had so many good times I mean you know what I Would just it was hard to like anything you play really well\nThis is true or we were very very blessed\nAre from the onset with a golden brass let the sunshine in album um that to put us on the map it was incredible\nThem a second album Billy came in with that Rickey a blonde kid came in on the second third album um there's many songs so to answer specifically\nI'm On my behalf only because people always ask about strawberries\nAnd raspberries and perhaps hundred proof they became signature tunes for me and I have to admit that when I see the people react and or\nSing versus with me or it is so wonderful\nAh that you have the audience singing with you knowing the songs and uh\nSo I my answer will be lately let's say after retirement it was strawberries and a hundred proof\n... interesting there you go belly good songs now we know rich yup yup yeah\nRichly which we wait awhile how far away now you you you say that again we associate\nOvernight with you over this is true that was that was a great tune with ... your big hit ... overnight and him and are different ... live on recording it wasn't it wasn't song the same way as we did live\nThe last ... the last verse overnight was shrinking pages namely\nInstead of uh we ... the car is parked we answered overnight overnight\nUm the last verse was overnight instead of the quick overnight you know so that was a great tune for Ricky in that king you know did very well for us\nAsher abilities are many many tools on that second third album ah came through for that but\n... will be on drums with us today and as

eye on them all and I was listening\nTo you guys on me that yeah but your story about the traveling and\nBeing away from home all the time it's tough it was tough on our families for sure and we just thank God the that they are accepted everything and still there for us you know through 'cause uh we'd have a ... a man I agree with that many many miles many\nMany occurrences everybody has been safe we were very fortunate\nWith all the miles that we put on we never had a tragedy other than\nBlowing tires on our vans because hey we probably were overweight or and we travel too fast because we have to get to the next gig so ah the miles that was the worst thing is is the fires blowing tires off\nThe van you at one time I was actually driving to than in high speed ...\n... and ... just hang on that and we don't touch direct don't touch the right to say on it or we're going to the states and then I recollect sometimes would be coming back from a\nA gig way out somewhere and ah we start off on the road and Roger would be driving a bus to so\nAnd uh we'd all fall asleep on the what do you what would wake up when you say hey I Need somebody to take over sometimes we'd only drive maybe Fifteen twenty minutes down the road and I'd wake up the next morning still in the same spot\nI'd have to call in work is am sick I Can't come in well Roger was bright I mean we all did you yeah you know we were just\nYou're right after you know after traveling after playing the gig and of course the new grassroots noted for building up to the bar as they would say in this New England their area we'd belly up to the bai and uh and so it was a long day and uh after the gig and we gave it all we\nHad right Billy we used to be soaking all the time\nAnd so then we have to pack up and hit the road to go home if we were five six seven hundred miles away sometimes Fifteen twenty minutes on the road Roger would be too tired heat pull over thanks be to God you oh yeah you know we already metal there for hours and hours and and and then be late\nFor work but the funny thing is we wake up and we think\nWe're almost home and on the cycle where he got really still hear\nThe best ones were planned over six dollars was that brutal and then [noise] then we're hanging around the bar talking the Frankie good toss the\nTone for hours every bit crowded and even leave ladies and\nGentleman

Roger ... bill soup that I'm at that point um Stevie do this and ... the school board is six\nOriginal golden brown was telling me to you just mentioned Tommie caustic forgive me Tommy caustic a vital part of it believe it or not Tommy was vital to me because I had never played with the pope to ban prior to the golden brass\nAnd so Tommy was kind enough to come over during the week you were still going to school\nAnd so it was an eye as a matter of fact and Tommy would come over with his accordion because I had no idea how to play bass was a folk band and so he came over and we went over songs to make sure that I knew the chords\nWhat to do how to play it so Tommy is the most dearest friends that I have going back to the golden brass are of he's a he's a spirit that I Will never forget God Bless you Tommy and thank you you and your family are great\nWhich if I could ask the name change from the golden brass to the new brass what triggered that great question again I think you for that the change became the change occurred in Nineteen Seventy what\nRoger Lee ... in Harlem ask you were instrumental informing the golden brass Roger was the money and the personality Carl was the businessman\nAnd they formulated this and of course Carl was the music guy too so um and so what happened was\nAfter fifty after fifth fourteen Fifteen months\nThe senior members of the golden brass notice that we were not getting our fair share financially traveling our first year we were traveling band from the very onset and there\nWere the golden brass members were not getting compensated in the proper fashion according to the senior members of the golden brat\nSo they brought this attention to all of us five of us and then we decided that we were going to walk away from Carl Hurley asks the after Eighteen months and unfortunately that's exactly what happened now why the name\nCarl Hurley now ski in Roger ... formulated the golden brass I Do believe Karl ... started the name of the golden brass\nAnd I don't think there was any idea that there would be any suits or anything why we couldn't keep the name\nBut Roger had decided that we should change the name and so as creative as Billy soup them myself where one day in twenty below zero in a Volkswagen with no heat coming back from some gig\nWe decided on the new brass very very original\nNo ... no dramatic name should have been something better than the new bras but that's how it all ended so Eighteen months later that's how golden brass changed to the new brash with the fiber original members\nNow the next year and I

put this down basically as you're finished floor correct okay did you glue it down or just a nail it screw it how did you attach you nailed it okay All right [noise]\nWell I'll tell you it it it's it it appears for some reason that the veneer of that plywood is um is rippling I'm Joe underwater causes that but do you think it could possibly just happen over time\nYeah Sharon that's one of the question is I was going to ask looking at these photographs couldn't quite tell or these ripples blisters or bubbles that are in the near the top of the near the plywood or do you think they're just into finish DePaul your thing finish because they do look like they're blisters\nThey are not just in the air I understand what you mean that would be my stuff flaky what now\nIs just ... ... yeah it

these look like ripples almost I'm like in vertical lines but I wasn't sure if there was just in the ... if it's just in the finished you know that would be an easy repair you could send it you know

bit of the stain laugh that you had before\nWe do yet I'm gonna\nLet me try this little monkey wrench Iraq ha ha I understand what you mean by lifting up uh-huh I'm not the most tactical person I learned a lot doing this house but [laughter] um when you walk across from areas feel like there's an air pocket\nUh-huh that's probably what I'm trying\nTo relate it seemed like now Sharon but one thing I probably would have recommended back priming the plywood what you meant painting or learning and doing some of the underside prevent moisture for coming through 'cause that might be part of the problem\n[laughter] yeah [noise] and ... and of course of course blue helps a lot to you know in that same thing but as it is right now um I think the best thing for you to do is to be able to re nail in any of these areas that may feel like it has some pockets hundred than scraping any of the loose material off\nThen maybe a little bit of Sandy narrow along there and then put you're saying you know re stain it and then you're able to polyurethane it back over just in that one small area and I should be in pretty good shape\nOkay or more monkey ranch and now I Will let you get for the next caller ... state the air from the cold air conditioner factory floors\nAre probably not because your air conditioning actually is designed to poll\nThat air ... um the the humidity out of the

great thanks doing we're doing great understand you've got the old humidity issue flaring up on you\n[noise] yes uh we're just checked it it's a two\nDifferent parts of the house I'm a sixty one percent and sixty percent that seems high\nYeah that's why yeah well it it it is a little has not as bad as it could\nBe certainly but you you love to drop it down below fifty per cent probably forty percent is considered the what's um ideal but sometimes it's hard to maintain that but um um how about the\nExhaust fan so we got plenty of exhaust fans going on in those bathrooms were using those and that is pushing that air all the way to the outside\nI'm actually it's pushing it up to the addict who don't have a we don't have it out through the roof\nOkay well everybody hates to put another hole in the roof found but boy is it important to get it out of their cars that you made it to be hanging in the attic\nUm if it doesn't have a really good way of moving that air out um it's going to really affect your living area I mean it's not like it's going to drip down through the ceiling but certainly can cause condensation and just contributing the humidity too too that um do you have air conditioning\nYes we have central air and we have a inflation up to its over forty four are\nGood good good okay\nI'm going to tell you the truth is that seems strange but that actually could be contributing\nTo the um increase humidity in the house now that doesn't mean you need to take any insulation away that's good but just a lot of times when you have that blanket of insulation again which is the way to go it just may cause more of a need for air to be moved out of the living area\nAnd exhausted so you know using the bathroom fan and I would recommend going ahead and in routing it through in the most direct route you can ah through the roof\nAnd of course if if you're not comfortable getting on the roof don't get on the roof get a roof or to drop by and take care of it for you\nAnd that will ensure that you're getting that you know surge of of humidity in moisture out of the house a same with the um the arranged should in your kitchen and using that shower that exhaust fan when you're showering\nFor at least ten or Fifteen minutes afterwards to really move that hot moist air out the same way with the range could after you finish preparing those gourmet meals leave it on for a little bit longer but the other thing that are really um\n... you know effects the indoor humidity more than anything is your air conditioning system um especially if it's too big for your house so any idea how that unit is\nA yes in fact we we did it do we did the furnace and the air conditioner this summer\nI see okay [noise] um but but you weren't monitoring the mid ... prior to that are saying no OK\nOkay for some a lot of times um do you know if they did any kind of calculation on the real needs for the air conditioning and heating in your home or did they just replace it with the size unit that was there before\nUm I think they replace it with a size\nOK and here's another kind of a weird technical kind of thing you upgrade your installation so that means you need relief theoretically\nLess air conditioning in Haiti so with the air conditioner not having to work as often\nSeems like that's a really good thing which it is if it's size dry but what happens is it will short cycle so it'll come home and then because of the insulation you have it will adjust the temperature in your house not your humidity but the temperature in your house and it'll go off\n\nToday's

home\nFor your whole family they Joe we've got a lot of 'em got a lot of emails here let me go go to this one this one came from Michael in North Carolina and\nHave a lot of uh seems a little bit of a problem with Florence Hurricane Florence costs so much flooding out there and you know all our listeners and friends there in North Carolina Virginia Tennessee area\nI Know a lot of it really did have a lot of problems and you're you're dealing with the aftermath of that and we certainly have been thinking about you hear on today's homeowner and hope that we can help you in any way we can we been posting a lot of articles on today's homeowner dot com of things that you need to think about as you're returning home we want to do everything we\nPossibly can but Michael writes in Joe says I understand the whole concept about around the house with the wheat polls\nIn the brick but it seems to have backfired on us recently\nBy this recent hit with Hurricane Florence the backside of our house was completely saturated and lake formed in the cricket area behind our fireplace the we polls are located directly above\nThe roof on let me see here\nI think he probably has a ... nother wall that extends up past\nOh yeah and he you know so the yeah and ... and it's so it's above the refunding flashing on top of the cricket area if we had not been there the excess water that lead into that cricket area would've come into the first level of the home\nFortunately I knew how to cut through the drywall and access that area and put buckets in place to capture the lakes so now we're looking for a solution to avoid the situation in the future\nHow to better steel office area should another intense rainstorm\nPass through the week polls are there for a reason why it would be your advice on that for Michael\nBattle for for people are familiar we're we're using the term cricket era the cricket is simply a flashing that's put up behind a ordinarily a chimney to direct dump water it's coming down the route from just running right into the gym and it's like a little roof shape piece of metal flashing just to divert water but in any case\nYeah the um unfortunately for Michael these people are not designed to move an intense amount of water we polls are putting brick homes to allow just condensation some moisture to\nIf it forms inside the wall away to drift off they usually high up on the wall and low on the wall and you know build up of moisture will jump out but when they're not designed to keep back or hurricane so there's really not much you can do some people think oh I'll just yell at the polls yet we pulled yeah that's great when there's a hurricane but what happens you know the other thousand\nCrying tonight as dire again right so [noise]\nUm I'm not sure what I can tell them I ... I wouldn't obviously would never recommend feeling of we polls and I think you just have to um you know realize that these are not designed to prevent water infiltration from hurricane you know only just normal moisture\nSure and one of the things is the uh the phone back or ride may not solve the entire problem but temporarily but using some of the three quarter inch I'm Around back or ride that is a phone type material that you used to um fill in larger areas that need to be caught prior to cocky but you could put that in\nAnd I'm just kind of packing in there and then after the storm take needle most fliers and pull it out\nThat might restrict some of the water from going in there but yeah I forgot to you know that that that that might help a little bit but that is one of those unusual scenarios and I I Would like to say Joe maybe that's the thing we need to start working on our invention to figure out how to some kind of temporary we poll filler because we get a few calls like that from time\nTo the ... poll filler yeah\nYeah and they ran it was going to have to work on that one there and then see what kind of jingle we can put along with that one [laughter]\nOkay let's go to the emails back here again with I'm a Mary from Minneapolis says Hi guys we really love your radio show my Nineteen year old mom came to live with this recently\nAnd we happened to make a few changes to our homes to accommodate her in the bathroom and sought a few safety grab bars but she still needs some help getting in and out of the TBI have any suggestions thank you so much a ... ... very very important yes but\nI'll tell you those walk in tubs on I'm seeing those sayings advertise everywhere and so many people are realizing the benefits of those that they fit into a traditional five foot um tub space um have you had much experience with those jokes\nYeah I've I've not um installed any but I Know that um they are becoming more and more popular in the prices come down a little bit you know as as um more and more homeowners are moving you know becoming multigenerational households but those walk in terms of still relatively expensive crossing between two and four grand\nOn but they would solve the problem in this case um you know it's one sure way to solve the problem\nAnd there's ... there's also a lot of a in a medical supply places I might you know my my brother was a quadriplegic so moving you know people around them and different things there's amazing amount of fall lifts\nYou might even related to something that a kind of an odd comparison but something you would lift an engine out of a car that's a little hydraulic type thing that they're made very very small and uh has a a kind of a a kind of a cloth or nylon type of um\nOn it like a ... that's what I was trying to say and so there's a lot of those things that are also available to make that safe and easy to get in and out of the tub but the walk into probably is one of the better ways to go on that\nI also wanted to mention that they do make 'em depending married and mentioned how you know um difficult it is for her mom to get enough but they do make a thing called the tub transfer seat which is a law and vents that kinda straddle the edge of the tub so\nWhat a person can do is they sit on the bench lift one foot over the edge of the top than the other one and they slide over and they're still in the tub and then they can stand up so and they do make safety things feel safety grab bars the amount right to the edge of the ... that's another option so the um I Would start with that\nAnd then depending on um our mom can handle that then maybe you know you may have to eventually move to step in Tom boy\nHad Nicole when you hear these days about um parents so you know growing old like that and the aging in place and areas so trying to adapt your home so that people can can change the living in the place that uh they're most comfortable with her we have a lot of information on our website\nThree nine seven nine for\nThree three that's one eight eight eight three nine seven nine for three three thanks so much for a ... or ... friends that go to brush for working with us on this great give away let's go right through the email here let's see we have Sylvia that I ask how guys I have a wood standing question your specialty joke\nI'm ...

that we put in the air by burning\nFossil fuels and to a certain extent lumber but much more so a fossil fuels and some of the other chemicals chemicals we put in the air like methane which is called natural gas but it's a natural um that pollution stays in the atmosphere\nAnd forms a blanket\nOver our earth\nAnd since the beginning of the industrial revolution we had been putting more and more and more and more\nOf that pollution which we call greenhouse gases and\nWe are blanketing our earth and causing it to heat up\nWell be look what's happening in Florida with the fish and the

whole [noise] uh ...\nWere heating it up very quickly and things cannot animals and plants cannot adapt I'm at the same time we were doing other things like in Florida there's huge runoff ah from\nThe

we are\nOn track to Armageddon we're on track to the end of the world as we know it can we turn this around\nAbsolutely we can turn it around but it requires\nA will a political will that starts with every single thing king person who can understand and\nEverybody this basic physical fact\nThat we are blanketing the years with our pollution and\nWho says I Am going to stop that published it's simple\nIn a way but it's actually because human lives particularly privileged northern human lives are very complicated it is also complicated\nWe the main thing that we must do is\nTo fight for our leaders to implement\nNow massive policy shift towards conservation and renewable\nEnergy okay break it down then so I understand what can I [noise] what\nCan you do is vote for people who say that

the website or you can call the folks who are who are indicated up on the website and talk it over but you can switch your energy\nYou can switch or electric consumption to all wind through that does that what you have if you're a journal we ever combination and don't ask me how we do it I'm not very good at this uh ... we have a combination mass energy plus we have bought into co op power\nThey're they're a community shared solar they have an array in Massachusetts and if you buy and you get\nTwo things you get solar a produced electricity and you also get a Fifteen Percent decrease in your\nA they have an array of was I don't know what\nAnd they are a solar panel oh I'm Sorry and other you know like Harvard, Massachusetts I Can't remember where it is and you try to do this\nThat's them because you ... or ...\nExactly and in order to a follow up on that ... people please go to\n... power and eat again either read through their Web site or call them because they're wonderful people is a complicated is it's like now I go to like be going to science major and I know they they take they take all the complication out of it I don't know how they do it because\nThis is not fair yeah they they perform the magic on there and\nAnd we know that eventually\nWe have bought our our stock of what we use off the grid is coming from the places where we want it to come from and what we need to do overall is\nTo make that shit from renewable\nBuddy to get that a lecture a city that's come from ... coming from a new do you notice\nA change in in in your house in terms of you know you're getting worse and then you know ... ... it's the same thing is not lifted which is still have electric\nWe have electricity all this time we're very happy\n[laughter]\nAnd we'd fly you know a little far every every night or so and and then we rented around it and it's just like any of those cars and then\nJust sees it but\nThe visual that you're hearing\nNow is Marty's husband Eliot crunching a\nBag [laughter]\nThe so okay that doesn't mean that wins and then there's us energy people can look better solar called on our people can look that up and think about buying an electric car and when the cold to set up your your plug you\nKnow we did have to install a higher voltage\nI'm uh\nDidn't speak English and Spanish is so bad even after all wrote that I was only there a couple of years you know\nHas an improved much I must say I'm One of those challenges people I guess mhm anyway I took my husband with me on one interview in Louisa mhm you could translate and another person out on the nearby was perhaps I don't know where\nSomebody a friend of mine who lives there and spoke Spanish\nAnd she knew that person the rest of 'em I did\nAn English\nBecause I found out something interesting that I had known what\nI'm from the time the Americans came in and started public schools there had not been public schools um let's see we're I mean there were school for the wealthy but not for the uber also not for anybody else [laughter]\nAnd when the Americans built up their schools they brought teachers down from the states mhm spoke English so the language of instruction\nFrom like ... I don't know Nineteen hundred until I'm constitution day in Nineteen fifty four\nFifty two fifty to thank you ... was a was English just\nLike you know some ... my grandmother was one of the public school teachers who testified before a community from the ACLU or what that meant to bring in ...\nIn Nineteen thirty to thirty three I think to say they're making a teaching English and a lot of I don't speak English and so that people should be taught in their native tongue and because she cheated that my grandmother mhm some ... some of the irony how you say very quickly\nShe was fired from her job as a public school teacher and learning yeah and then she appealed to the first lady of the time Eleanor Roosevelt I have copies of the latter write him where she asked the first lady who as you may know we used to have a column in the newspaper\nRight my day I have a ... I have a book with with all the columns\nAnd so it'd be she was much more you know first ladies I I guess we're much more comfortable then because my grandmother went directly to her in English telling her about what had happened\nAnd then Eleanor Roosevelt wrote her back and said no you weren't for independence and Puerto Ricans need to be taught in English does nothing I can do for you essentially that's what she said\nOh and it was crushing and ever since I read that letter every time people want to create some sort of a large you know named after Eleanor Roosevelt I think if my grandmother and I think that all of us are people of our time and maybe in today\nAnd she was ahead of her time in some ways but another way it's not so much\nWell I I think I think now people are much more politically correct and they were then I mean are slipping politically correct wasn't even a grandmother found that wasn't an option\nBut it would have been considered it was like okay we're here now we do what we what yeah yeah and some right over the grandmother and I'm sure many other people travel and said that's not right right but and the stories that I got\nFrom people they told me how they hadn't been able to go to school before and now there were schools the schools were taught by Americans and I think I I Will swear to it I think Spanish was like a an auxiliary language\nThat right no that's exactly what it was saying when like if you want to take it you can take it you're not going to learn anything in Spanish so that was that you know how some people that worked out to learn\nSubjects that way and even to learn English time waiting for the vast majority of people they could not imagine you having to learn Spanish any subject you know\nThirty five years I still speak Spanish\nLike well because I think that I think that knowing language is is like knowing music is you have a gift brain right you have a knack for it that's right and we're person\nYeah yeah and to come for for our listeners tell us a little bit about your town you were born in raised aware and how old were you when you first one to when\nI was born in New York I was raised in Baltimore, Maryland I was a young mother when I moved to Puerto Rico with my family in the summer of Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd a researcher arrived after we'd there so I remember watching one walk from a um rented apartment until our furniture that we can move into a house\nI remember watching the moon walk on cell from a swimming pool or I was taking\nClasses on how to swim because I used to go on the water and just think they do this and we worked together and one of the newspapers in Puerto Rico and you're on a journalist you're also book editor you're a writer your day and his team didn't\nDistinguish restaurant reviewer you've given so much back to work the recall and then this book which is so important to me you've you punish bilingual ... article for children ... and you got to talk about yourself in a row of all\nThe things you said or I'm thinking to myself out that I really do\nAll [laughter] you know and I must say\nThat if it wasn't for having wonderful editors who encouraged me all along the way and you\nKnow no okay yes yes yes let me tell you that Internet yes yes in any event let's move forward\nThe English language papers and what not and then after I started the tables magazine that I Will no longer with the papers\nUm they um Spanish language paper el deer meet your right restaurant reviews for them and they I wrote them in English and they translated them everybody knew I was terrible speaker [laughter]\n\nBut but so so I Would say I happily gained about thirty pounds\n[laughter] trying to get rid of [laughter]\nBut anyhow um yeah we we had I did tables magazine which was a ball and I did a book called kids in the kitchen which has a recipes from four kids not from kids but for kids\nAnd one chapter are on the kids from Puerto Rico who competed in the young chef competition that I think wherever those supermarket in those\nDays sponsored\nThe rest are recipes that I got from you know\nLittle outlets that recipe events of his a window Bennett's recipes which are it's a beautiful book to begin with it is beautiful and full color and they're great recipe for\nAnd there's an English and Spanish version and they're still selling\nAnd how can people find out about all the books that you published well you can talk to me and how do people talk to you Doug Wilder reach treat publishing and online\nEditor\nAt ... street publishing dot com\nRead street as in reading are Eighteen like you're reading a book do you have a website\nAh W.
