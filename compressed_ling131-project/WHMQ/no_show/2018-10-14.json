Europe in the U.S now everyone learns that and\nAll you know Amazon ... lobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful offices in DC and so it is so this Google and soda stay stuck in there all breaking bread and getting a number but I I mean they're not dumb they're protecting their turf and their shareholders so\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation and we have our problems in our diction with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it this is this and this is the other worry I have Michael ... that even if we say well they're too big\nI got to respond to this one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... no longer and they're about to go out of business would teams but back when Sears first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market boys and said\nYou don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store you can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing to say\nUh you know I can you mean I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is that on steroids but we were\nYou know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns at the time that we're gonna wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that\nAs we're in a world marketplace now if we\nSay Amazon we've got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know or you know can have companies that are that big are we going to see the day where we knock down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business park because although I saw what they did to publishing that government part\nI I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple apple Amazon and the the rights and the constitutional belief and the human rights\nThings that they just look the other way when they do business with North Korea's a lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and that while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so\nUm if it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of\nReally good innovation and that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find your direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas\nAre then we've got a problem at but you know ... ... it gets so much money they get more profit margins wanting economies but most country yep\n... which is very careful about this and their interaction with our regulatory regulatory I'm a student in the country is it's pretty lousy ah we'll all care about them for some of the United states not education and the regulars are just lawyers with a you know law suits and they're\nThey're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's relevant to antitrust ways the only place to go and I'm Wondering what to do the judicial system or not it'll handle at all\nI'm just worried that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon showing jaws and it'll all come into big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance an overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nThank you sir good talking again glad\nIt off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state so maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it has disqualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did\nAnd there's certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous statements to back it up I'm ... but in theory you what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for John college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who is um testimony was what was supposed to be believable because people watched her and wow she sure looks credible to me\nBut hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one backed\nIt up at me and what about that front door she she had a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying um that certainly seems to me to be false and as much as she ... jets all over the globe to go surfing\nOn who paid for the for the polygraph all I guess she corrected that one but whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six ear ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and denied um you know the next\nThe next hearing on the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an absolute disable make having all look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent do you think prosecutors and just talking about the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the me too crowd\nOf you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a writer so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and tried to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sense have sent innocent men to prison um while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nAnd and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often going to be a federal cases a local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you seriously\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a false one we're right through equally hard how ...\nWe get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the world and go after a fall took user\nYes and as you indicate it's older men idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward\nNo actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people's lives being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks at an eighth a\nI'm really bright had\nA bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in highschool served five years in prison\nUm God out his accuser called I Apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on ...\nHe got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh\nHearings so it's gotten a zero perhaps that's this guy Brian Banks\nI tweeted a review of the movie um yesterday I'm but I'm going to see it I just I've just read the review and think of it this guy's life was completely when I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there has to be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this and the next time I talked to any politician either side they're all I'm going to say to them would you like to see us go after the fall accusers justice as ... as tough as we go after those who are making a legitimate one her latest book\nIs called resistance is futile how the Trump painting loved lawsuits collective

three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nOne of those ... things for me is the extent to which the Democratic party seems to have fallen to pieces\nThey've lost over and over again they I Know they keep talking to a good game about how the midterms are going to be there whether they're going to win in the midterms and then they pull off a stunt like the false accusations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and that\nIs starting to work against them so now they've decided to go rogue embracing violence of law ... behavior saying when they go high or when ... when they go low will kick 'em\nA road runner McDaniel joins us now is chair of the Republican National committee it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nI Am thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures the Democratic party are actually out openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted in major media\nAnd so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want where we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's timid violence\nAnd all of this not too terribly long after Congress in ... college very nearly lost his life because the left he decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on a baseball field do they know what they're doing and and do they understand how the American people are probably going to respond to this\nWell it's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership\nI is putting their party on and it's a dangerous by our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick 'em Cory Booker saying get in their faith Maxine\nWider saying get crowds around people something's gonna happen and we already had it Scully sketch shot we've already seen crowds on the ground truth and chairs and there's an other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are looking at the essence saying it's not Democrats not\nJust regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for that and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it just dies that shift in our democracy for her to say we will not be civil unless we're power what a threatening thing to say\nIt is not at all unless wind power\nRun it you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the surreal Iowa who's decided to usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery basket\nAnd and it's the behavior you kind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind of behavior\nYou expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're going to continue to be under civil or in civil I'm not sure which one is probably uncivil\nOr until you give us power back and we're going to scream and yell and and probably hurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we did it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry out a real active of violence that they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out it does angry division I mean with the Democrats are not for a long time but this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that\nAre frightening lifting a leaf in our senators having had security details this is not\nSomething we want long term for our country and the Democrats take to be called out and I'm saying is that chair when the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats faith that they don't like it they'll interrupt their family dinners or create my around them what you should do is go out\nGo get involved and make a difference fallen chair stand up for the people you know but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our\nCountry and Democrat leaders need to be called out and I hope\nThat the voters are looking at that because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by ... like I'm the only way we bring back stability to Washington is if we reject the play but that they've been writing I just kept ... at that age that drive for two years now\nRun it can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I put a bug in Europe and I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to a Democrat leaders leaders in say will you condemn these calls for violence now I compared the other night I was in Seattle for a form of a panel with\nA bunch of other talk coast from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party the leaves the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't you know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters can we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republicans stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they were holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks asking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight\nAnd if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that\nI think the media can only ... ignore it so long and then they'll have to acknowledge well maybe when you need to go to Hillary Clinton and say\nYou just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily that sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should hold their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today shelling some of these not that had been created a along with the words that\nThe Democrat leaders we are definitely trying to hope that our craft accountable and you're right of media and you could do it and we need to help push the media to act in a way that they don't always get because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe're going to continue to set an example of stability we're going to continue to run on the issues the results that have happened to that said medication that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent unemployment Claire millionaire jobs wait is that so many great things are happening across the country and legal contrast that with the resistance\nAnd the vision and the destructive nature the as the Democrat\nParty and hopefully I Know that for a sex\nThe voters will reject this terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to the\nBottom line because you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various Venus and he was ... generating gigantic crowds\nAnd I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times what it was a candidate\nYou should throw that guy out or punch him or you know things like that and they were the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence\nBig you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does that are conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out in the streets and burn some things like antifa does which I Would never do\nOr you know that that that would be condemned quickly so if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own\nI think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it why aren't you asking the other side ask of folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown in the state where I broadcast ask her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low\nAt

actually as funny somebody just real to me and said are you worried about being called racist I was working on this story for nearly two years before I realized with black\nYou just knew the name I just you know I met him I mean I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I ... that might sound weird people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby alive and then cut them next with scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yes he is actually but I ... we had never thought of us I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of us\nNotice that he was black now tell me about this the most\nInteresting thing I think about your ... shoes you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person yeah for you in the same room where you through glass\nNo I was in the same room and I mean I was wondering I'm like yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounge\nWhere he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against uh against the wall and he pushed his share opened his legs and kind of trapped me between his legs if you know what I mean I have my likes cross\nAnd then it continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points and it's on sorry once I'm terribly sorry and he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this meant less Lewis voice the soft voice he smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is he's serving three life sentences and talks about you know she was in office Jamie didn't get into the poetry class\nAnd and then he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations because he's just ... like this\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to a lot of music it's you know he really liked reading and hasn't been able to read because he seemed so busy all these years but it getting to read true crime which he really enjoys\nI mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah 'cause he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I started listening to ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name and I love jak rattled by the way the ...\nSooner who died I read a lot of your listeners would know him again big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself but he had this incredible voice I'm an ... goggles looking at me saying what's the name what's the what's the name of that song on the same as well and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at ...\nAnd then of course I say you know kind of ... and then he leans right in Maine goes mimic key to a and start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like are you serious is this what's happening right now yeah so that was the guy has\nNo sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you

what according to the grand\nJury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stop with this hurt evidence they said it was in ...\nIt was not and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy the Soviet kill all of them combined come nowhere near that\nSo this guy and you know the only reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in American the only reason is because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children\nAnd that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he got stopped title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who world will never know and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be a witness to the fact that they lived and and it's not an overreach\nTo call his clinic an average war that that it was a slaughterhouse and that it

and the author most recently of the Republican Workers Party or the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and\nWhy it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program thanks for the John\nLarson thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of a president but frankly I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we need it\nAbsolutely right I mean we were bound for stagnation remember when people talk about ... percent groping the new normal now we've got four percent yup it said it could never happen and we had uh\nIt led by you know really nice people but they just were up to the struggle of taking it on to them you\nKnow they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departure soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he I mean we are getting rid of him eventual enemy now at the end of the year\nBut this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCat food they write you know and the thing about and I'm Glad you mentioned Paul Ryan I couldn't agree more of the thing is you know the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president I buy some ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all races creed and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind\nAnd I you know I'm I'm afraid that the kind of internationalist wing of the Republican Party all in favor of you know free trade agreements and all that they had lost touch with them and and then the end\nYou know we succeeded I'll tell you one thing about the book I debate left wing earth and and they say workers kind of we own that word and I say you know you're in years to there used to be a Democratic Party that looked after ordinary people and that was an honorable party but you've given that up and you know what we ate their lunch\nIn fact doesn't it seem and I I look I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the the you know the party of the working man and working woman I keep wondering the policies they adopt\nSeemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of folks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the mid sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well\nAnd and so there there is the antithesis of representing that individual worker who's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nYeah by the way that's up from about fifty six thousand above five years back I mean we're we're doing pretty good I mean wages are going up\nBut you know the the thing about the the dams as they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans in a you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think uh from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and sometimes are used terminology ... that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms and one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that\nFor my audience the way you see it\nWell it's it's hard to hear from the dams um\nYou know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on\nAnd uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong race or the wrong gender that does to your your your there they're not terribly interested in you but mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with you know critical concerns like transgender bathrooms\nBicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean that's the only people are really rich you are going to worry about that stuff\nOkay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job where I Know it's out the oil worker who's who's worried about about you know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten invested in frivolous concerns\nOf the people got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you become an all lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with\nOur people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house painted this month of the car payment or can we really afford to take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class and so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily\nAnd then but you have to build in or out in pretend\nThat you care about that coal miner who's being who Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job a friend who running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left this is where the the series justified is said and that's where\nThere was this big old union battled back in the Nineteen thirties and you know Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on I thought the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump\nSo you know but you know talking about the late ... look or you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway\nI'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause I thought these relatives who are working on the assembly line than Detroit and I figured if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently was telephone justice what how does that figure into the whole equation the oil and you\nKnow I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works in Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict pill form of the you know the party boss the old communist days you'd say what should I Do\nRight so the telephone you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result and I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law and Russia and we got too much but here we got\nWe got to search going on for the great Trump ascendant and and you know mostly it's it's just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of the line for the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talk to the right to tell the Russian ambassador is going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI and say can we talk to you about your conversation\nYou should assume that they already have every jot until from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into a into a process crime\nOr you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement as the FBI comes in talks in most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly wherever we are in the country is\nWrong thing to do maybe we should\nI mean I hate said Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents top sheriff's deputies you hate to start acting like when the police show up or the FBI shows up you say\nI should treat them like a treat the G are you if I was a a an an occupant of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party and he hails from George Mason university professor it's good to have you on the program we'll look forward to return\nBut they looked at her and said she is qualified to do the job therefore it's not our place to tell the president who should be there and you heard a lot of that language of the last week well he may be qualified but he's not the right man for the job\nWell the person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president the Senate can say this\nPresident you nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way not mentioned this\nLittle uh it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office today\nAnd Kanye West sitting across the desk from him and Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes and I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know\nThe standard line from the left is what this man is crazy now why did they think he's crazy\nBecause he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy well I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit\nOf ...\nAre I have a conversation that said that welfare of the reason why a lot of people say you know first of all let a lot of jobs are so as far as I say they say we're getting more money for more head\nOff and then we got ... Institute at the age that I had a pretty good just shy\nOf ... which is actually far harder is going down right now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on that problem area and saw the super\nThe ... the\n...\n\nIt gives you power in a way he's talking about the hat that is keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan

had\nMain guy they have to see my dad always high black guy\nIt was ... and they feel like Superbad\nThat ... the era\nNow that's Kanye West saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero [noise]\nKnow that a lot of the leftist said this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively say to young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say that programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them\nAnd you for having me a guy that looks out for you ... you know\nWhat at that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but I I dropped that one out because yeah he was sitting in the oval office Kanye West managed to drop a couple\nOf swear words but his message was all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who is both black\nAmerican and successful it's sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what

Penn is easy to lose your place in situations like this it's simply unemployable you rely on your own local filler standbys\nI'm a former maybe you're just hesitate and stopped talking altogether\nThese are what Michael er regard calls and verbal blunders and just fluency\nOr aren't was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives showy investigator done laid out his findings in his book hum slips stumbles and verbal blunders and what they mean\nOne thing he found out is that we all stumble though some of us are better able to semester than others\nThere are certainly people who you know when they say these things some of them do it well they make a ton natural and they use to fill the pause as a kind of punctuation and I've heard announcers on television do this quite a bit\nAnd there are other people of course who said between every single word and that really annoys me but I quite admired the first instance I don't know that I\nAm quite good enough [laughter] as a speaker to be able to do it I don't know if it's deliberately maybe that's just a matter of style but it is true that everyone does have their own baseline level of this fluency\nDoes fluency is the name for hesitations like oh man oh to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech for our sins you have to know how we talk what's going on when our brain and our mouse work together it might surprise you to learn that we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking is\nThat were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group of smaller or larger units and there's a basic architecture to those phrases and to those clauses that we sat in our minds first\nAnd then we go and we select the words to fit in the architecture and then we associate the sounds with those words so it's kind of a linear process yeah one thing that happened than another thing happening in the other thing happen\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrases and clauses than we say they're simple enough but ... says it sometimes things get a little jammed up on the assembly line of our spontaneous conversations\nNow in the process of planning what to say we can't speak at the same time we're most of us find it very difficult to do both of those things simultaneously and so we plan and then we think and then we plan and then we think in very\nFast cycles fractions of seconds\nBut still they're cycle and we're kind of moving back and forth between\nPlanning what to say and then actually saying it and so the other phenomena are these moments where we are alternating between planning and speaking or maybe wherever you get stuck in a planning phase and so we fall silent\nMaybe or we decide to fill the silence with a little sound sometimes it's an a or um sometimes it's a word like you know or well\nThe ... will buy some time and they'll work the listener that we are done talking so please don't interrupt it also gives our audience a little insight into how our mind is working speaking of insight there's another verbal mistake that's been touted as an unconscious look into the deepest recesses of our mind no friday slip\nCould describe what the flip it and say well these two sounds swaps with each other or you selected the wrong word and\nAsked for say a condom instead of a condiment the forty and part of it is where you come in and you say\nWhy did the person make that flip with that word when it seemed to produce some kind of meaning that we can interpret as having some sexual innuendo behind it or having something slightly salacious or obscene or having something slightly hostile\nThen there is the ... in his book or ride offer some examples saying equivocal when you meant to say equivalent or jam Marines instead of trampolines\nWhen we hear people make verbal ... or use a lot of ... and ... there's a tendency to think they're not very smart or that they're hiding something from us around and says the evidence points to something else\nSeemed pretty natural to want to come to a pretty broad sweeping conclusions about somebody based on the way that they're speaking or they lying can I trust them are they smart enough to do the job that I've asked them to do and things like that and all of the reading that I did which involved\nA pretty massive search through\nThe literature in which there is an attempt to try to link the fluency and slipping behavior with\nCertain kinds of personality traits\nWith pie cues with education level with all the things there's no reliable link between them so what I conclude is\nThat that is lower the particularly is a pretty good indicator of state\nSo someone state of mind someone's emotional state they're not very reliable indicators of traits intelligence character leadership a tendency to lie for instance\nIn the use of this flu and sees in that way really starts to border on a kind of linguistic discrimination where you come to conclusions about who someone is essentially based on the way that they speak\nIn our segments on viewpoints we usually score about all the homes are long pauses and six of the tongue dark estimate for the sake of time and to keep their answers flowing\n... suggested that we try and experiment to let our listeners decide for themselves if editing has any effect on what they think of his speech so Syria's continuing his thoughts on the perception of truthfulness and verbal slips and fluency first the edited version\nThe notion of what is considered truthful is now I think becoming a little more like just natural parking which so we'll have hesitation to it'll have an arms and that as well now those there's a stereotype that people who are speaking\nFluently aren't telling the truth or maybe who are educated\nThere's a stereotype on the other side which is just as dangerous I think which is just because someone is hesitating when they're speaking or just because someone was saying oh and um that they're necessarily more spontaneous and authentic I think that's a dangerous stereotype as well\nBut I Do know that the regulation of private industry has basically over the course of my lifetime I was born in Nineteen eighty has led to a country where okay perhaps we have\nSmaller government but in its place we have bigger business that can be just a potent force in people's lives and when it's geared toward profit rather than the public good\nHave situations like today a moment of historic\nWealth inequality when the c._e._o. of some corporation make like three thousand in time the salary of the workers on the floor and so on so that's one piece of the puzzle I think it's sort of these impenetrable systems that an individual doesn't stand a chance against in many ways\nThe second main issue smart pointed out was how our health care system off in places poor people in positions of disadvantage\nDental care in this country is incredibly difficult to access for people in poverty and actually the Affordable CARE Act that was passed in twenty fourteen as a kind of compromise to the other side of the idol removed dental policies from that coverage as those somehow\nThe health of one's teeth is separate from the rest of one's body and so\nThere are a lot of hard working people who labor sixty hours a week then end up with a cavity that goes on treated and my dad and then this group he ended up with an infection up into the route that turned into ... so essentially he had blood poisoning\nFrom what could have been treated originally as a cavity\nAnd so for somebody like my dad who don't look like the famous shiny pearly white straight teeth the the same and celebrity that we idolize in this country let's say that he did everything right according to the American dream he works\nYou know this man and let it get laid off and then he needs to go find another job he goes into a job interview and because of the person interviewing hair holding classes ... century or ideas about my dad's tape looking like something that they associate with dirty people\nHe doesn't get the job and then says he doesn't get the job they can't afford to get his teeth thick\nWhile her book explores these issues and more it's also written with a defiant pride in her childhood ... society expects up poor girl from Kansas to feel shame that's why she reasons terms like red neck and white trash or thrown around so pejorative fully\nBut ... says those so called red neck tendencies led to some of her fondest memories for instance the time her grandfather rigged a canoe to a pickup truck and drove the family through the snow for some thrills in a flat area of Kansas\nThat's a story that you know I had such a special place in my heart and yet it is something that someone would look at that\n... that portrayal within a movie it would be like oh there are some redneck\nWhat a white trash thing do I write against those words and center in the book because really what's going on when people want to get high on the horse about their socioeconomic status as a period of what else is really just\nThat comes from the same place as any other sort of derogatory term we as a society has a gun at least I think ticket chatted with\nRacial slur at that's about

we're not talking a heavy ... this is just to get rid of some of the flowers to get rid of some of that excess weight and then uh\nIt's the same thing with the roses or get rid of some of the old

hay or something along that that doesn't have the weed seeds um if you can't find that you could always use extra but straw again has those weed seeds\nPut it to the side bringing home put it to the

to the water your structure or get a little bit stronger on their er and continue on their would I Would suggest doing is once the ground freezes\nOr protect where that plant is that you've put their uh by putting some a salt marsh hair some mulch around the base of that plant a fall by twelve area um just have to get ready for winter again that could ...\nWhich probably All right\n... would be fine just realize that some straw has weed seeds in it or some of those weed seeds might be moved into the other areas of the garden um so that's why I like to suggest the salt marsh hey ... usually weed free\nBut I Know salt marsh has a little bit harder to get in the garden centers right now everybody's decorating for fall off so they got straw\nNot ... it's a bad thing you can actually use it it it's going to help you but wait until the ground completely freezes and that might be around the world giving before you put that on there\nOr do you put it around there so you were to put it around there today we get that cold temperatures are rodents are are are trying to find like home for the winter to over winter a rug would actually be\nMaking a home there if you were to do that and then eating the the plant itself and then you wouldn't have the climate is uh going forward no um no so that that's one of the things I Would suggest doing a is waiting again until it freezes to put it around there\nOkay but leave leave the vine right\nThrough I liked it I like to leave it just to to you know some of it might come back for you for the ... you know next year I'm any party gotten that jump ahead um for next year\nOK okay it also gives something far to climb on I guess\nYeah exactly yeah okay so that's that's what other things I like to do\nOkay should I be fertilizing it again now for the fall\nOr I mean at one time at this on line with that that would be fine\nTo know you you know you don't want to go too crazy on it you want to do it at like half the rate um\nYou don't want to go too heavy 'cause you're not trying to promote growth you're just trying to promote heavy like root gross oh\nI'm so that's that's one of the reasons why now you go half the rate because you don't want to give it to much nitrogen or the nitrogen promotes the green promotes a lot of different things so that's one of the things you just don't want to do\nOK well probably about a a about a month\nBefore or since I'd put any fertilizer on it so maybe I just believe believe as it is without for lunch with them\nYeah I Would I Would not put um [noise] I Would put I Would not put fertilizer on if you did it a month ago that would be your last fertilizer for the year I'm OK gets so that you know that's going to help its root system over the winter and that's really what you're looking to do you're looking to help that the the roots versus the shoots\nA so that in the spring headed again with a a plant tone or maybe you know and I'm beginning of April ... that type of thing\nAll right that's what I Would look I'm what I'll do is I'll double check or during the break a because there are some cult of ours of um [noise] climate is that you can cut back\nBut I thought this we bought him from it as he wouldn't cut back but let me just double check it out looking one of my books I'm so listen to the other side are open up with it because we do have an interview or coming up in a minute\nA poker and it's a it's a dollar I keep listening I'll do what I can to make sure I get the right answer for you I mean either confirm or deny that I was a rough [laughter] okay well thank you very much for things they have a great day on them here eight five five and six year old ... six one\n... the company that makes all these plant and fertilize because something new for you this spring due for in one week controls that\nKills weeds grasses market an algae using on sidewalks patio ... and you will see results jumped out was also an all natural it's a control for roses vegetables and flowers staffed acting and killed all stages of insect from eggs to adult and a three in one natural Disease Control for roses vegetables an ornamental a triple\nUm options for people with large and art and then we also had hoses breaking it which covers ten thousand square feet so you know we're getting pretty close to that time where you're not going to need to apply but it's still really good to apply up until the point where it's cold enough where you're not going to have any of these\nUm insects in regard to the mosquito to complete control is a hundred percent organic and it doesn't compromise any plant 'em so it's safe around your garden your flower beds\nOn it's biodegradable and it has like a ... now so the new chemical smell at all\nAnd it's um all beneficial insects friendly so that's really good um so it doesn't harm your be your earthworms\nUm birds or anything like that so we we really like this product and I stand by it I use it on all the time I feel like sometimes the mosquitoes antics themselves take you up and take take you away there's still many sometimes\nYeah it's a you know a lot of people think job once it starts to get cool all the mosquitoes that you know the ticks and fleas that type of thing or just go on a boat if they don't realize is doing in a final application at this time is are going to help get rid of some of the\nUm the ticks that over winter uh the the mosquitoes that type of thing that are over wintering creating over wintering\nUs also with all the rain we've been having any of the stand the uh type puddles um or areas of water just ships um that's where the mosquitoes are starting to come from so we might have some you know wearing that can be sixties during the week up here so it's a good time to be spraying the so uh it's a great one to have\nUm we've talked about ... multiple times um you give a little bit more information on the road allies or form\nYour so sure ... it's actually one of my favorite um products that we have um it's really easy to news comes in like a powder form and it's a hundred percent organic so you're literally just feeding your plant anything which it roots can have ...\nI'm here just feeding your plant full of an official microbes that relief feature root system it helps them survive those you go pick up a plant at your local garden store\nWe always recommends using fertilizer as soon as you get at home and the reason for that is\nHere plant really goes for like a a process when you're transferring in your car back trucked to your house um and it goes through a little bit of a shock um and it's reduced as bad as well as when you're transplanting any plant 'em we recommend cheese teen\n... still it's full of um different beneficial microbes and it's actually\nThe different than official microbes um\nIt's registered with the organic materials Institute which is a great things for homeowners as well as like gardeners that wants to use this product um it helps but that that um grow you're really strong roots and actually speak that's been the on the termination\nIt replaces the need for an eastern side can be used which is a great thing also um\nAnd actually protects or plants against environmental stresses like weather change um temperature change and you only have to either one of the month so one tablespoon mate for one gallon of water which will actually treat a bunch of plant those plants don't take a whole gallon of water\nGreat um so\nYou know this would be perfect to use I Know fall is are the best time to be planting so anytime you're getting in a any your trees and shrubs right now I add enough or ... or to the soil is really going to be beneficial to help get that root system developed for winter\nOr get ready for next year I'm Talking about some some soil conditioners 'cause that's that's one of the things that the fertilizer will help do as well I'm Talking about some Lyman sulfur um that you guys are have so we have\nTo products that you can't find in stores and I really like this um option because our line\nStuff for both enrich to with our fertilizer and again that's a hundred percent organic so not only are you balance the key H\nUm in your soil when you apply you're lying or sulfur you're also I'm Out eat organic matter your soil you're breaking up track nutrients on your any of those systems those nutrients tracking your soil with the use of our other lives there and so they'll conditioners\nDo our line it's all purpose fast acting um enriched with the ... and believe it or not when you have an unbalanced soil\nPh you're actually losing about Seventy percent of your lawn food on TV or a plant fill our products to help break all of that up on steel plants can use that and really strive\nSo I'm not overly stick in your style that you're actually healthiness brat plant or you were on guard and vegetables or your flowers wherever you are applying that um it's also really good time of year to you a soil test you can be prepared for a\nSpring time so as long as you can sit down a soil conditioner before your first brought 'em you can apply that and they'll break down through the winter months\nEnd you can be ready and be more prepared for the springtime because you're really when you start springtime easy for conditioners you're kind of um preparing your lines for next year because Lyman suffer takes a while to actually break down and ... the analysis and they're still\nAwesome is a great uh information there and uh I got about a minute and a half left them saver for last 'cause

I'm over time you know ... of the density of it makes it makes a good solution for that sort of area\nWell because of the way it's made up and also it was about the easiest insulation I've ever dealt with in terms of installing edge you know you break out the old sir rated knife and you're able to kind of carve\nOut the little areas around any a roof supports that you have or any of the plumbing pipes or anything that you have to cut around and in that it can really be a headache when you're using other type of insulation but and the important thing about that is\nThat's important to tighten it up around those pipes as much as you can and ah I've never seen anything easier than ... old and being able to do that very thing\nThat exactly I mean that's that's one of the other benefits because of the friction fit uh that you get out of it when you cut it properly it's sort of forces you to do it correctly and when you get that ... that you get a better insulating factor\nWith a lot of people don't want to you know especially\nContractors don't admit through his is what it is to especially with with fiberglass people sort of push it to shove it ... and you can sit around obstructions which is essentially you're defeating the purpose of the inflation at that point if you've crushed it though it's not going to be a ... it's not going to have any sleep factor at that point\nAnd certainly another benefit of course with the middle do resistance mold resistant\nAnd just you know overall moisture resistant properties to make it great for crawl spaces are just about any place to you have and we want to remind everybody we've got some great videos online at today's homeowner dot com where we've actually installed a lot of rock pool in addicts under houses all over the place\nAnd certainly raw will dot com Lance or any other questions that you may have Dave it's all always great to to have you on the radio show and to talk with is a little bit and I look forward

message through Twitter it's at Danny lifted right now we have Charles on the line from Georgia\nWhere the um middle a deck um improvement question Charles welcome to the today show on a radio show thank you very much what can we help you with today Charles well\nI've got a I've got a little project I Want to a\nCover my deck okay and I'm On a low budget All right and I thought a building some momentum sales huh what a hang in a way to where the water or\nA drain off of the sales and brain writer for what and I have to worry about any build up okay and I was thinking of a constructing a cedar\nFraming type system to where I could either utilized both the a curve Plexiglas or plastic type things that they sell at home depot right to divert some of the rain\nOr just hook up\nWith like corrugated acrylic acrylic\nOr or just set up with a third of fabric that they sell it I see it that were killed some of the water right not get set up with wires are touching the wires on the eve and post better on the deck and have a mangled as they come off right\nSo is it is it son or rain\nBut it's not so much as the sun but also the rain to okay so so you want to block San hammering well someone in the rain it got assigned\nIs most important because that dries out the wood and\nWrite write dries out the people on the deck to yeah\nThat's correct [laughter]\nWell the ... the first idea have our sales cloth excuse me you can buy you've probably seen these sort of triangular shape sell ... yeah I have not\nGotten square wins from my key okay and those same to work quite well\nGood as those are great they they they will um divert some of the water and a great a block and a son but more importantly for your\nUm point of view there really lightweight they're inexpensive and you can you need very little to clip them up to the eve of the house now they want to come under these so as water lines off you know it it catches it\nAnd then you can use 'em cables and turned buckles if you need to to attach derailing now you have post that stick up above your railing high enough to catch the other end 'cause that's all well and you might have already\nPut um where they're railings we're right on the four by four is coming up by remove those and then they extended with no good posed to come up\nTo eight feet so that I could attach from the top of those and string 'em to the uh hooks\nOn the eve that's why I think I think the most affordable and probably affect the way would be to put up depending on the size of your deck put up two or three of these cell clause\nIn essentially the same level and then with the space in between you put up two other cell ... above it and the ideas as water rice as rains you know the rain will hit the top\nTwo and that will drain off on to the bottom three and drain off if you're just worried about the sun than you probably wouldn't need four or five of the like two or three would be bribed because obviously you're going to put them where the dining table is where the lounge chairs or whatever [noise]\nUm so I think blocking son would be the easiest way would be the easiest thing to do blocking the rain will be a little more difficult either way I think you could do with just a sale cloth and if you go on line I think you can get um really affordably\nToday's homeowner was very lucrative produce each week ...

Eighteen thirty so they know they're marble business down there\nBut that is not the most interesting fact about silicon really it's also the site and the first documented case of an object from outer space hitting a person\n... where do you where do you dig these things up so that you hear and see what I did\nDig that I get it for a bigger the incoming marble had to be a marble it is\n[laughter] in November in November of Nineteen fifty four nine pound chunk of a meteorite a roof of a home and bounced off radio instruct\nMisses an Hodges ... on the couch taking a nap\nWhile I'm Still not in fact they named the media right after Mrs Hodges in his has forever been known as the Hodges media right wow there were some of the first documented case of someone being hit by a chunk of outer space junk is to look out if you're up there and look out here\nI think it is a is a bit skeptical of no no I'm not none of none of the lease but I was just wondering if we're not going to mention the other famous residents per of of silica go or or a former resident of silica not that not aware\nGod oh my oh\nIs that right Jim ... wow that's great\nFor just passed on there a few months ago and a hearing a lot about his biggest state out in Hawaii that he's selling this little ... quite a state that if you're thinking about getting a bomb is only eleven or twelve million you know and\nAnd I got into an eye out 'cause I Love macadamia nuts so it does it but they may have grown Hoover's yeah [laughter] so while we would all over with that one right there but uh uh anyway we really do appreciate all of our listeners and especially this week those in Silicon August so I'll tell you right now let's see if we can\nHelp out a Susan is on the line right now from South Carolina Susan welcome to the today is on a radio show\nAnd can stay very\nGood I Hope so I Hope so here you have a kind of a mystery there which is often the case in in homes but tell us about what you found out\nWell if I had to have one that never asked for aspiring think I had to find a way it's a lot and so the other night out and cut it in and it's looking down in LA there's hot outside the door is that any bank\nSolve I there's no water and there's no water there's water at the entrance of like where the doors and ah and then I felt up underneath\nThe day and then the base and that question\nIt just call gang or a way a tank separating the shame of it I don't know what's going on\nAbout what type of countertop be your hands Susan\nPedophile ah [laughter]\nI used to have one of those [laughter]\nYeah I'm taking it out and it looks like he may not have a [laughter] yes it was\nWhite flour and then\nFind that land on top with by thank I couldn't even get into that define\nPlastic laminate yeah but that's okay\nYeah that's okay well you know I'm of course I have a sink is something that you have to be aware of you know that sometimes you know an older counter will flex a little bit but that's okay um but the the sink definitely it's always better when a sink is installed if you um you know are able to put a ceiling a good\nUm kitchen bath type ceiling around the opening and then set the sink in that wet caulk\nUm but without that is still very easy to go around the perimeter of the outside of it and it does need to be done because you know when you wash your hands or you're doing something they're in a little bit of drift get here and there is going to go running behind it\nAnd a matter of fact just last week we removed a kitchen sink\nWith the countertop and so forth it are we still renovation for a TV show that involves\nPutting a um an inexpensive granted in in place of it and as soon as we pulled that top off that whole thing just\nFell apart because the exact same thing just a little bit a bit of a drip of water has been going into this over the years and us it was in place they didn't know it but the minute we touched it just fell apart at the back of the sink so the same thing could happen to the front of your saying so\nIt's pretty easy just to uh basically clean around that lip\nAnd you don't have to take it back out and then just ... just like you would any um

another guy aim and Samantha be both fortunately landed than on another channel and uh her program full frontal is immensely entertaining\nAnd smart and I love it the only problem I have is that I'm never sure when it's on a sometimes just on Wednesday nights and then sometimes it's not I don't know I keep looking for it anyway\nA and I was kind of I boycotted the the Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nNothing is a drug or not but just like oh my God another late night show with another guy how many kinds are there on late\nNight let's see there's a Jimmy Kimmel there's Jimmy the other one from NBC than just even called bear and then there's Conan O'Brien and then there's the mar\nWhen there's like so many in fact and now another one [laughter] no but the other day I heard something and listen to Trevor Noah speak about a ... you know just caught on our time this Trump time and\nI realized well I've been missing the law because he's he's funny sure and he's also insightful and that's something we don't have a lot of on television is insightful\nWe have a lot of the the drama that plays out on all the cable channels where the same old same all analysts get you know they get via lead from one program to the other one to the other one sometimes in one day you can see I don't know either on your on four different programs\n... and ... and\nLike that with everybody and it just becomes echo cynical chamber um yes I we agree Trump is crazy and what else is like no Trump is crazy just keeps going on and on and on\nSo when I listened to Trevor Noah and I'm going to pay a little bit of what I heard I was very encouraged and the I really like him now and I was wrong to discard him just because he was a guy yet another guy I should say on late night\nJust doesn't mean that there shouldn't be more women on late night if somebody does mean that there should be more women unlike now because I'm sure there are tons of women who are funny and also insightful that should have their own program\nBy name\nBut I thought this was very good in this era of it's just a voucher rage because of what Trump has been doing\nAnd then what can I Do and he's not one of the Supreme Court oh my God a second second uh second sexual\nPredator is on the U.S Supreme Court no wonder we're also upset\nAnd some in some men are just ... are starting to figure out oh I get it I see now why are so upset I I didn't realize that the world was so unfair to you I mean I kind of know what but I just didn't know just how much and I didn't know how many women I've been sexually assaulted\nLove all the lord so ... she's talking about the essay at the essays called the ah the uses of anger women responding to racism and she's talking about anger as a political tool\nAnd she's talking about it being precise like what are we angry about and how are we going to use that anger so let me see what I'm On it this is my favorite quote\nI have settled the wolf lip\nHuman nation laughter protection fire in places where there is no light no food no sisters no quarter so she's basically saying that anger saved her life\nThat so I feel Arlene I feel that anger is what strengthens me right and even though we are taught to not be angry that also makes me angry and that\nGot me strength to sway I called you and said I Want to talk about anger yes because I feel like um well I grew up in in the middle east and household\nUm my mother was a survivor the genocide the Armenian Genocide and my father experience a lot of these locations although his financial situation was better when he was a young man came here to go to Colombia um but my parents especially my mother wanted to control me\nAnd how I Survived was rage rage I Would scream hate you\nAnd I was energized by that and talking a lot this week and last week about wins anger\nI realized that my mother was very angry ... and this is one gift she gave me her anger it hurt at the time and it was I I shouldn't have been the object\nOf it but it allowed me to be angry despite all of the other messages that said don't be angry be a nice girl\nAnd I thought last week\nWhat if Christine Blasey Ford had been angry and I'm not criticizing her I Am not criticizing her at all but what if she had been angry and then friends reminded me that probably it would the outcome would have been the same\nHowever I Would have felt better if she came in there and said you know what I Am really mad I've kept this all these years and now this man who had bused me is going to be sitting on the Supreme Court I Am furious\nI that's a very interesting question and as you were speaking of trying to imagine what you would sound like angry especially with that voice of her said it was ... it was a surprisingly young girls\n... it was a young girls with a very interesting observation\nAnd so but I also think yeah it it doesn't matter if the the end result would have been the same kind of and I would become a it doesn't matter for\nThe result I don't think because they decided this you know and and their display of anger now so that's what's different you know Trump said be angry and he was I didn't watch it I I was busy\nIsn't that something I I I could not watch\nKavanaugh speak only in a small pieces I I I've only watched Trump at his rally in last week and smaller pieces now I Can't do it and Lindsey Graham on so I watched that did you see Lindsey Graham and no no no I didn't channel and goodness they it says if\nThey were they were mocking doctor for ... and all women who have been right is sexually assaulted well\nWorse than mocking worse in ... so when people say women aren't allowed to be angry it's this it's this response which trivialize and were attacks you know and somebody said to me yesterday you know\nWell the response is so bad okay the response is bad but we need we need that anger and\nSo when I saw it again about Christine Blasey Ford and what would have happened if she had been angry I think about myself and all the women outside who are angry and we would have been\nThat anger would have been validated yeah you know yeah and again I'm not criticizing her I no no no that's that's that's what they are very difficult thing she did and I don't know what I Would have done but she was making nice with them and joking and\nIt was kind of like Patty Hearst to the Stockholm syndrome any type of thing in terms of she was very soliciting us of the very people\nWho ... who were going to disregard her completely right she did everything she could to survive right\nIn that way but in a way like how does she feel now how would she feel if she had been screaming at them\nWell what like it I was having this conversation yesterday and I'm interested to know what you would you would would you would say like if she were in my family what would I tell her so she where your family if you had a way of speaking to her like what what could you told her my response was\nDon't look at the news right yes he got appointed you did everything right\nThis is just and this is just yet again\nA another example of how we as women are desired I Would hug her and make a really good meal [laughter]\nA delicious meal to aim and then what are the rest of us do though like ... I might it might cortisol levels are way up here they're very high\nThey'd been high ever since Trump kind of a White House they just shut up even more and I feel actual along with my anger\nA sense of the what is it doom and\nDread dread [noise] I'm not sure that everybody's gonna who needs to come out on November six is going to vote [noise] yeah\nI I Am for the last six months [noise] skews me I had not been watching television news and I feel much better than the way you find out because if you read I'm informed ... nobody yells at me mhm I don't have to listen to these horrible people who are in power um\nI Know what's going on I informed but I feel much better and I try to do things that I can do um you know I write posts cars I make phone calls I you know I'm I'm a member of a circle of care for refugees\nYou know I Do that stuff and I try to take care of myself and my friends mhm because I think that you know and and I've been thinking oh this is really terrible this is really terrible\nBut um when has it not been terrible well yeah I mean in in your own family or the Armenian Genocide is cited personal you know in your own life in your own life but yet when it's always been terrible we had this conversation sometime ago it's always been terrible right\nFor then why does it feel so in the end of days terrible now [noise]\nBecause I think we are diluted to think that this is a very strong democracy but when you look and see who who is a democracy for women didn't get the vote until Nineteen twenty you know African Americans now the voters being taken away\nNaturalized citizens are being in danger of being the citizen eyes I mean settled or no separated from their parents have already lowered our parents you know but you know when when people say oh the Supreme Court\nIs being politicizing this has had never happened before again\nTaking children away from their parents excuse me the Supreme Court has always been politicized will always be politicized because the justices\nAre nominated by the president and they are um but has not confirmed by the Senate and look at the Supreme Court after the civil\nWar every single law they came before the Supreme Court after the civil war ...
