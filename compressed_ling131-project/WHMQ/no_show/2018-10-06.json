commentators I've learned\nThat the weapon of choice that the U.S must prepare for is a is not just an anti ship weapon but a hyper sonic ... an anti ship weapon anti has a piece up that indicates that China right now is testing a hyper sonic glide vehicles\nA tie do the Chinese want us to know this is that why we have this photograph\nExactly the Chinese don't let us they don't just step out there and the better Edison's post willy nilly on the Internet about their military people that they want they let us know happy what they want us to see\nA minute this case ... we're seeing a the shapes of ... vehicles\nThat are being locked in a way up in the air probably up above a hundred thousand feet by a balloon a like a weather\nAnd in a in a terrier that can drop them and if you think about it there that's really a low cost effective way to get data on how these vehicles or in the atmosphere a\nOperationally they would be watched by was the goal to weigh up you know at the edge of that fear that once they get high speed they would be released and then they live a high percentage speed\nTo their target um allows or just your basic like a tree understanding how that works out but like I point out the peace John\nThis very well is taking place in probably it take place ... years ago um we know that they're testing these weapons actively beyond just like testing you know a with a little from every indication they're looking for an initial operating it go rather first episodic\nWho is quite type weapons right about\nThe uh big system as I understand it is designed to stand off the fleet\nStand off our fleet especially our carriers\nAre more than outside the first island chain which is which means our allies Japan and our ally Taiwan\nAnd also deny the U.S Navy's capabilities of striking China or striking the bases of hyper sonic live vehicles can we defeat that now ... do we are we preparing to defeat what the Chinese can offer from their bastion sees\nRight so when it comes to hype assault weapons actually these types the goose idea called ... they're\nNot like a ballistic missile that is pretty much out of a strict ... track at a potentially engage with another missile of these are very hard to defend against at DARPA has watched his ship just a couple of weeks ago we reported on it called the glide breaker program\nAnd that is a good a built an

couple of thousand miles or other stores\nAnd a barrage her basis at our existing in that area there within that bubble lifted missiles meaning that we cannot strike at will how that's how high\nMaking access inroads toward the mainland China\nSilent shame so their strategy is multi full but also it's clear\nAnd we're filing what the ... coming to terms with this and realized that we have to it that that we want to have called the building that theater under those circumstances we need to ... that that's just in the high end capabilities the high end weapons herself but it affected the\nDefenses against the hypocenter glide vehicles yes writers and right now just as of twenty Eighteen we have less than a minute chai your opinion is the U.S navy are capable of striking

and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together into meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's suggesting brown a suggestion is that uh maybe it's time for the United states to begin to match from a government funding perspective some\nOf this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects are\nTowards some of these areas hyper sonics and we are investing run hyper sonics but it's a it's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are surging very quickly to a head in some key areas artificial intelligence and we are standing up by the Pentagon is standing up a a new\nCenter for artificial intelligence research but that's military specific and we can bring in a commercial entities that also have their uses out of that and when you signed up to meet those names you're going to have more success in in a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interesting or even though\nYou know uh it's it's now the Trump there he actually a structure very on Trump Ian chord are talking\nAbout how are the most recent round of tax cuts is probably not going to be in line with a stepping up to meet those new challenges because it increases the deficit which makes a more consistent funding for those new research and development priorities a little bit harder especially as you go forward and future budget so\nHe wants are in the money he wanted now he doesn't want it in the future he wants it right away even though the defense department is now loose again because of the budgeting DIE you things at once more and in addition the controversy over remark that he makes and I agree with him immigration how does it work for and what does he want\nRight\nNow and this is also a something that\nRight now you see a big\nSort of pitch battle happening within the executive branch and and really across government where you have a you know within the executive branch voices like Stephen Miller that are looking to curb a not not only to deport undocumented immigrants by the uh hundreds of thousands but also to curb the amount of legal immigration that can take place and browns\nPoint as a you know this economy ah works great and it it serves the national security purpose when it becomes a magnet for a smart scholars and students from around the world to come to study and most importantly then to stay and start businesses here that's actually a big part of why\nA pure competitors like Russia or China because we have an attractive place that only to come and study but also potentially to start to make money and to really tie into the system uh so ... the one of the best things that he advocates that the country as a whole and against that actually\nGeared entirely towards the defense department it's really a holistic look at you know how to begin this competition\nOut one of the things you suggest as making it easier for folks to come to study it and and to stay or if they're these you know folks were especially working in these in these technological fields or so that they can uh\nYou know tied into the system and contribute a solutions to\nThis ... that the H ... visas that silicon valley's talked about for years he wants more stem

immigration yes so brown doesn't feel that the doors been shot on him on in his face he thinks that there's a ... there was a dial up\nRight but you know at the same time it or if you watch the perception if you look at the optics if you look at that that the rhetoric or that sort of surrounds this debate\nOr he's very clear that a ... and he used the word liberal immigration policy

important that didn't lend themselves to the other ways I had of expressing myself which were very different and very immediate like treat them videos but I made the day before apple at them\nThe result of this need to work through a lot of stuff is greens debut novel\nAnd absolutely remarkable thing the book\nTells the story of April May and average girl suddenly thrust into Internet fame and global politics\nThe book is a sigh fire adventure and also an urgent reflection on our culture on line\nApril's Internet fame in a lot of ways in this book to be a long time to write was a way through which I helped myself understand my situation and that was weird because she doesn't she isn't real though it is strange that she gave me insight when I made her up I guess\nBut honestly like reading the book changed a lot of my perspective on you know how we're giving I should be of myself and and what mistakes I see myself making and what the things I should be most scared of our\nAnd ultimately I thought starting the book probably like in the back of my mind some more of the thing that I should be most scared of losing my job and my audience than not having that stuff anymore and now the thing that I'm most scared of is losing my health and my family and that is so obvious that that should be the thing that I should be most scared of\nIt has helped me realize watching April make our mistakes within a lot of ways me making that mistake on paper so I didn't have to make it in real life\nThe unforgiving nature of the Internet is a focal point of a book ... says the permanence of our opinions on line has in some ways this allowed individuals to evolve and change their thinking\nSnapchat first came out and it's like oh so you can send a message but it only exist or Fifteen seconds that sounds like it's being used for new D pictures and yeah sure maybe sometimes but like isn't this obvious that young people would want to wait to communicate that didn't last forever\nBecause that's how we are communicated and it's interesting to watch as these services are being created to allow for precisely that young people are on the lookout for those systems so that they can like\nUnderstand even if not super in the front of their mind that they're not done yet their opinion might be different in six months than it is and that's something I worry about we should all feel comfortable with that that maybe I'm going to get more information and I'm not going to agree with my perspective\nBut in this world I'm more worried about adult frankly where everything we've ever put us on the Internet\nPeople can find it then we feel like we have to defend the perspective that we once held but don't anymore and if you feel that way then you never will change your perspective because you are constantly defending yourself\nWhich is the main way that we prevent ourselves from changing our perspective as soon as we're on the defensive that's when people's minds they stop changing I'm more worried about adults\nIt out I'm very worried that we are we've all gotten as adults very caught in our perspective then and didn't capable of changing\nAnd absolutely remarkable thing also highlights reel concerns over our cable news on social media news cycle are cycles that can often seem devalue immediacy and debate over anything else\nIt's not just them it's all of that\nWe are I think and not everyone but if you are active on social media and you are an active political Lee minded person I think that we all sort of decided that we would all be pundits and that we would all be professional argue ours\nAnd that that was a job that needed doing and we're all going to do it in our own little ways in our own little part of the of the world and what part of that to me is maybe that's good maybe\nMaybe we should have strong opinions and maybe we should converse with each other to try and get to a place where we all agree on or like groups of people agree on you know perspective\nBut also maybe it's bad because most of the time when we do this\nThe right after something happened when we have the least amount of information when that is the worst time to be talking about something and that is the only time that the new talks about it when it's happening a day later is or even two weeks later is when you actually know what happened\nClearly the Internet has some problems but green also uses as novel and is online platform to stress the unlimited potential for good that the Internet holes so in the end those green sink the Internet is more good than bad\n[laughter] that's a big question I think I'm much more ambivalent that I was say five years ago but yeah I think so I think that it is a tool that we do not yet quite have the tools to handle correctly\nAnd I think that we are finding the weaknesses in the system daily ended so little terrifying and we're not sure if the you know how it's going to shake out which is why I'm being lawfully here but I think if you look at that connection with the understanding that it has brought the information that it has made accessible\nAnd I think that it provides a tremendous value\nAnd I think that it provides a social value and an educational value and the cultural value I think that it's been a great force for cultural mutation it's just that has made culture mutate very quickly and that has been a comfortable and also now we have tools for manipulating that mutation using\nMoney and marketing is getting a window of it and so our professional propaganda people and that\nIs scary and we don't know how to deal with it and we're going to have to figure it out and I think that that is gonna be all of our responsibilities together and that's scary\nGreen says the Internet there's incredible too has provided us with the endless examples of its positive social unity\nIn the moments when we're open to it it is allowed us to be into other communities and see the problems of other

know how did she pass among her comrades here she's\nSleeping next to them and in close quarters with them all day long and marching beside them and I came to the conclusion that it was mostly because people had no idea what a woman would look like wearing pants\nShe says that there were plenty of Manohar each and the ranks as well women who used their while to price sensitive information from the

simply because an infant gall is very soft\nSell is constant pressure as applied to the same area it can cause this call to change\nShape that can lead to a condition known as flat had syndrome\nI wouldn't actually call it the syndrome is a deformity if the skull and in the Nineteen nineties the American Academy of pediatrics came out with a statement saying that children babies\nShould probably sleep on the backs of their heads and the reason for this is that there was a higher incidence of sudden infant death syndrome or see it when kids who are either sleeping on their sides or their stomachs so they felt that kids would be much safer if they slept on the backs and we've been continuing to do that since the nineties\nAnd the sort of this the side effect of that as a kid just come in with a flattening either in the central portion of their skull or in the right or left side of the back of the skull\nThat's Dr Peter child professor of pediatrics and neurosurgery at the Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City\nIt can be notice very early on such that the child is born because there are cases\nSometimes when the child is I have so much into a strange position in the pelvis is delivered with some kind of cranial shape abnormality or the Kurds are within the first several my life when the child is sleeping you know crap or on his back in about ... and the softer skull tends to form somewhat\nMany parents panic when they discover a flat spot on their child's hat Kalb says the number one question moms and dads ask is will my child's brain gross our cognitive function be impacted by a flat spot\nI tell them that no this should not affect brain development because generally if you're pushing and one portion there's usually some compensation portion most of the consequences are static you know the way the sharp look\nMeant a lot of times a lot of clinicians will sort of just continue observing it and if it gets better gray and if there is still some asymmetry it's probably not going to be to noticeable\nSometimes you know babies have very little air very commonly and very easily when the baby in the shower and then the hairs are mad it against the skull\nAnd you can see it for me very easily as children's short to grow in their faces develop that becomes a major portion of their overall look and they grow hair she's the lessons children get older\nBut while flat spots are typically adjusted cosmetic issue that often goes away many parents want to fix the deformity one way of doing that is by having a child where I touched him made helmet\nTo helmet is basically much like a bike helmets for shell on the outside with some soccer but still somewhat from petting on the inside and the helmet the child comes in tornado sawdust artist take some kind of mold or impression either laser capture or with plaster ... and\nThe helmet is created from that that helmet and can't be recess or some of them can be taken away ... areas where you want the child to grow in a little bit more home can be put on where you want a little bit more impression of areas that are more prominent\nSo when the child may helmet they're wearing it for about twenty three hours a day you hear about sign I many many of our kids are in the hell that for about four to six months and they're allowed to take the helmet off anytime they want we usually recommend taking it off either for pictures or for bathing and I'm getting right back into the helmet\nBut before parents say yes to the helmet it's important for them to consider factors such as cost upkeep and potential side effects\nThey run about three thousand dollars in that ballpark I think many of the insurance to cover it some do not there's a little bit of work that goes into it on the part of the parents I told them I like a bike helmet\nDon't sort of purchased one in alone this requires like going to the doors Adonis you have to\nSeventy four hundred and our email job at

Brian thanks so much for joining us thank you for this book\nLet's start for our listeners who don't know the story let's Kevin outlined new please\nSure well this story is is one specific\nNarrative about women fighting for the right to fly and the right to race\nAirplanes in the Nineteen twenties and thirties and it's simply followed one group of friends really uh who who are who are rivals in the sky but really quite close on the ground and and those those group of a a deck of a friend includes Amelia Earhart\nA belief eight and a roof Nichols\nRoof elder at Florence clinging stuff\nYou know probably two to most listeners ... the only name there that rings a bell is Amelia Earhart but in the time that Earhart was flying other women were were right there with her and they were\nUh all brave they were all told they were all quite famous uh and and really\nBy the early Nineteen thirties\nIt it was not merely Earhart who was the most accomplished or most famous female aviator in this country\nIt was it was Ruth nickel and and in the end and this narrative of women fighting for the right to fly in the right to raise airplanes\nOne of them ultimately will beat the men at their own game a feeding the men in it and one of the most celebrated races of the mall in Nineteen thirty six\nUh and and it will not be a millionaire\nBut all of these women were more ridicule than they were praised for these efforts they were portrayed as\nMorning you know on a man's profession and I know of course you're taking jobs away from it was the claim but certainly taking the procedure and being in a place they didn't belong\nTo us about that aspect of their find\nSure so you know in\nIn the late Nineteen twenties when when the story begins women have had the right to vote in this country for for about eight years um but they're still denied many basic rights\nOf women in many states can't serve on juries can't file a lawsuit\nCan't work night shift a all kinds of basic rights that we would find it just shocking today at that are not extended swimming in the Nineteen twenties early Nineteen thirties and so\nYes I mean the the few women who dared to fly were were were really quite radical and and the numbers are stunning here you know and\nAnd it was here as a social worker in Boston she was discovered by wealthy east coast business and including her future husband publisher George putting them\nIn and they would put Amelia Earhart on a plane\nFlown by men across the ocean and and it is this flight this flight flown by men across the ocean where Amelia is essentially a passenger that\nShe becomes famous\nAnd and and every ... well no\nAnd and that to me was was stunning a again this isn't on reported it wasn't something that it's this is that reported in of course all the the biographies written about Emilia but I didn't know that and I and and most people do\nNot in a little bit more about another part of the story which is the races which is not part of aviation history than I knew knew can you tell us how that became part of American culture folklore history\nSure so first we need to forget about what we know about our modern day or shows these\nRaces in the Nineteen twenties and thirties we're ... we're real sport like baseball and boxing and just as popular as each of those um it it can\nAs a really a marketing ploy ah in the late Nineteen twenties there's a lot of interest in aviation driven mostly by Charles Lindbergh and his flight across the ocean in Nineteen twenty seven\nAnd and because of this people are very excited about this new mode of travel but it's a very dangerous mode of travel at the time planes crashed with regularity or a rare for reasons that we would find horrified today\nAnd mediation industry knew they had a had a perception problem ... and the races were really borne out of that they they knew\nThat people want it to the planes and they and they gave him essentially a show at ... and and drove people to to primitive airfields around this country to see planes race\nAnd and the crowds were massive you could have a hundred and twenty five thousand pain and in a single day just as many watching for free\nHalf a million than the single weekend just huge crowds and the races were were were\nExciting but also very dangerous and and there was a lure in danger\nAnd it was there was some

I guarantee you there's no problem I ... button\nTo do our dogs lie to try to show how big they are to what don't you Monti really\nSometimes I Try to stand up straight for just dogs are concerned about science because as we know size does matter and dogs will live out their size they do this in terms of sent marketing\nYou know have you ever seen those dogs tiny little dogs like little poodles and you see the blood thing they're lagging they're picking and they kind of\nJump in standing on the east coast is that why they do and that's why they do it apparently they're trying to get the pie higher up on something for the bigger dogs you may this is where the big dogs roam everybody wants to be a big dog when I publicly yearning now I'm going to end up\nPeople thinks like a giant that when somebody comes along and that's it they say Ollie smokes I'm not messing with the guy that person must not have been five ten they must have been seven three\nYeah it's about ten marking it's about dogs and how big you are and of course this didn't happen in this country we long time for this kind of stuck because we're busy worrying about how we pronounce things like a non ...\n\nWere busy not accepting the science that we are finding here but this was done of course in Canberra, Australia mate Australia was going to be my first yeah of course Linda Sharp as an ecologist their sharp who studies dwarf mongoose says\nMonkeys and what she found actually this is really cool is that these ... ... ... the small guys we sent marking singer in a band and you know how they do it Monte\n... no I understand oh okay All right because they're divorced right they will do handstands so that these small males can lead deceptively high marks for when the female comes by don't they say like\nThat's the way it's not terribly for the females it's for the other and oh they say oh we better why there is a big mongoose uh-huh is that why dog ... to ... what is it for the nation is sometimes right you'll see dogs mess and they're like a\nGrand piano to just show them who's boss and other times you'll see them sniff and it's like well I'm going to keep them you know I Know what they're afraid that if that dog comes back and noticed that there\nUh they're mad at all of that or I'd better to repeat often beat on yes it is weird how they used to do this but what else are they going to they can't write their name and you know with it I guess they don't have flags\nYou know\nI guess this is about ... feet on the moon instead of playing to the flag that would have been incredible and pretty darn near impossible I think it would be true\nIt's the law of France or Brazil or Germany and he conflate the two\nNow that he's been on the court of appeals and during the Bush administration's so\nCalled war on terror Kavanaugh almost always deferred to the president on executive power now the Supreme Court during the Bush administration did check and balance the executive the the president\nAnd said that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear ... corpus petitions by Guantanamo detainees they said that a U.S citizen\nWho's being held as an enemy combatant has due process rights to contest his detention and they said that Bush's military commissions violated the Geneva Conventions and the federal uniform code of military justice now\nIn two thousand eight the Supreme Court ruled in blue median versus Bush that Guantanamo detainees held as enemy combatants\nHave the right to file a B as corpus petitions in us federal courts to say on being unlawfully held but after ... end Kavanaugh on the court of appeals did his best\nTo try to neuter these habeas corpus rights that the Supreme Court has upheld in blue median in case after case and also Kavanaugh\nHas a at a record of dangerous difference to the president not withstanding the case of Jones versus Clinton the Paula Jones case which said that a president has to answer\nTo at least a civil case that didn't involve a criminal case Kavanaugh doesn't think that a president should be bothered to answer to a civil or criminal case while he's in office and under us versus Nixon a unanimous Supreme Court said that Nixon had to turn over the tapes during the Watergate scandal\nAnd that led to Nixon's resignation and yet although that case us versus Nixon is this\nIs a settled precedent cabinet has said he thinks that should be reconsidered and one of the most disturbing things Janine is that in a law review article Kavanaugh wrote in twenty four teen he wrote\nThat yes that take care clause of the constitution requires the president to enforce the law says\nThat the president ... take care that the laws are faithfully executed but then cabin all went on to say yes the president has to enforce the law quote at least unless the president deems the law unconstitutional in which you then the president can declined to follow this statute\nUntil a final court orders says otherwise\nUnquote soak Kavanaugh would create a dangerous presumption in favor of a president who refuses to follow the law that is very worrisome\nAnd it should be worrisome I should think two people of any political strike you know allowing the president to make the law and there are references also well we're in war time but of course given the war the war on terror it's like we're always going to be in war time so we can't really think about it as a as a temporary data\nYet that's the excuse for whatever the president wants to do oh we're fighting terrorism the war on terror\nThe war on terror is a misnomer terrorism is a tactic it's not an enemy and yet under the guise of this so called war on terror\nBush and Obama and now Trump are decimate in our civil liberties and Congress ah unfortunately not in every case and in some cases there's push back\nBut largely defers to him and the courts or the last resort to check and balance and out of control executive and yet with Kevin ... on the court that checking and balancing is not going to happen\nIt seems important for the conversation to kind of\nSeparate aren't concerns about Kevin on particular and then also this process but it's happening that's allowing him to advance in this way you know I mean there's the lack of Anita Hill pointed out in an op ed the lack of a\nProtocol for vetting charges of harassment or assault and confirmation hearings which should have been put in place before Clarence Thomas certainly after\nThere's just weeks saying\nWe're going to have an investigation by the FBI to laugh no longer than a week what kind of investigation decide how long it's going to last before it starts the process I think just seems so broken to folks and I know that we knew that the Supreme Court would subject\nMean Merrick Garland George W. Bush is not a new thing but I don't know it's hard to see how anyone can going forward see the Supreme Court has a check her balance at this point\nI think you're absolutely right and I think when cabin on I say when because I think his confirmation is a foregone conclusion especially because\nThis so called FBI investigation which didn't even last week this perfunctory investigation which ignored many people coming forward who had evidence including a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary who would confirming corroborate the allegations of Deborah Ramirez\nWho said that Kavanaugh waved his penis in her face and forcing her to touch it\nIt really is a farce but Collins and flake at least the two of them are getting political cover from this so called week long investigation\nUh saying there's no credible corroboration it was a thorough report whereas many many people and this is detailed in Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow is New Yorker article came forward and tried to contact the FBI saying\nThat they had relevant information and yet the FBI did not contact them they gave it a lick and a promise\nAnd evidently you know a during his testimony Kavanaugh said oh I've been through six FBI investigations and there's never been a problem well actually during the FBI investigation for his appointment to the court of appeals\nThe American bar association reduced their very qualified rating to qualified because there were problems with his judicial temperament and we saw that on display\nIn the hearings terrible judicial temperament I mean he was having tantrums he was aggressive he was acting\nA you know I Know you are but what am I with the senators which is just on part of and I I'm proud to say that I'm One of more than a thousand law professors who signed a letter\nSaying that he should not be confirmed solely on the basis of his judicial temperament which is really really beyond the pale\nWell I understand that Chuck Schumer is asking for the FBI report to be made public along with the White House directive\nI imagine that many folks who see it will never would think well you know this was a sham but what does that outrage translate to you know what what can we do and is this a tipping point potentially for making actual structural changes to the court itself\nWell I don't know about structural changes I mean that's that's a tall order but you see people in the streets today yesterday probably tomorrow and Saturday\nThe me too movement has really galvanized the whole issue of\nWomen and men and in some instances being afraid to come forward to report sexual assault because of feelings of humiliation or the ramifications and because of this time in history where Kavanaugh has been accused of these things in the wake of\nThe me too movement this has galvanized people all over this country and these people are not going to go away we are not going to go away we're going to continue to pressure the branches of government and the fact that there were two courageous women survivors of sexual assault\nIn an elevator with Jeff Flake in his face\nChallenging him is the only reason I think certainly primary reason that he agreed to this investigation the so called investigation so political pressure and I'm Talking about people pressure really does have an effect\nAnd we have to keep it up and people should be sitting in Collins' office and Murkowski and flake and mansion where the swing voters and they should be around the block and they should be demanding that they vote no on this confirmation\nWe've been speaking with Marjorie cone you can find her most recent piece five reasons why the GOP is rushing to confirm Kavanaugh on line at truth out dot org that an other work at Marjory\nCone dot com Marjorie ... thank you so much for joining us as we can counter spun thank you so much Janine\nAmazon got a PR boost from its announcement that after considerable pressure it would raise workers minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour\nAfter we learned that the company would symbol tiny asleep be cutting monthly bonuses and stock options such that many warehouse employees have said they'll actually be getting less money\nThat sort of maneuver as one of the things that rubs many people wrong about Amazon now one of the country's largest employers along with responding to charges of abusive conditions by having select staffers maintain Twitter accounts in which they explain step for like how glorious it is to work there\nBut maybe most galling is the this juncture between nickel and dime to employees some of whom report being in trash cans because bathroom breaks are recorded as time off tough\nWell just be those is Richard ...\nAnd how is it that a company with paid employees who rely on food stamps and that demands tremendous subsidies from communities just to locate there can be held up by media as an exemplar of success\n\n\nDonnie ...\nWhat do you make jewelry so many more

actually business that keeps the business of the United states of America\nIn business and you Democrats yeah you all have your you know dream with the little a what is that the castles and this guy and think about you know the community of people I thought that's what I thought that's who the Republicans were I thought that's what they had become\nBut in actuality they're they're they're mean\nThe races there that's their massage one is\nKamala Harris the senator from California said something recently she summed up\nTrump and the ... and his enabler as well but especially Trump he was at a rally this week and he made fun of the woman who is accusing the Supreme Court justice nominee\nOf sexually assaulting her and she said that one of the things that she remembered from the assault was that he left that her he and his friend were laughing at her as as he was as he was trying to rip off her clothes\nAnd senator Kamala Harris said\nWhat Trump did this week was whip up an entire audience of idiots basically she didn't say that I'm saying that into laughing at this woman again\nAnd then you you know and then people ask well why don't woman come out and say that this has happened what do you see what's happening you think this is new this is not new the only thing that's\nNo about their reaction is that it's happening at the federal level by the president and his happening by Republican senators\nThat's the only difference that's the only difference but otherwise it's the same old same old same old\nI don't even have I just don't have any patience for people

something else I Swear these people think the world is flat I just think they must think that the world is flat it's not flat it's round\nThe who who\nWhen a politician said oh this is normal you know sometimes it's really hot sometimes it's really cold or look it's knowing how the global warming\nHow do we counteract those arguments to really just a raise people's awareness of this is this is Lisa ... at the ... were on a road to to losing everything\nUm I think that everybody can understand the science in its most basic form um\n[noise] the pollution that we put in the air by burning\nFossil fuels and to a certain extent lumber but much more so a fossil fuels and some of the other chemicals chemicals we put in the air like methane which is called natural gas but it's a natural\nUm that pollution stays in the atmosphere and forms a blanket over our earth and since the beginning\nWe had been putting more and more and more and more of that pollution\nWhich we called greenhouse gases and\nWe are blanketing our earth and causing it to heat up\n... ... look what's happening in Florida with the fish and the alligators the bird\n[noise] yeah and what is ... ... they they becoming hotter quickly\nAnd this is very clear quickly in\nTerms of a geological timescale in terms of the time scale of the earth as a whole\n[noise] uh ... were heating it up very quickly and things cannot animals and plants cannot adapt I'm at the same time we were doing other things like in Florida there's huge runoff ah from\nThe fields that have been applied\nWith way too much synthetic um a fertilizer and so that nitrogen at going into the streams and rivers and then the ocean has allowed the blooming of algae which\nIs itself it it you could say that that's natural shove it okay\nThat is is feeding this\nFeeding this algae which is poisoning everything\nAround it [noise] um and those kinds of coalition of the changes that humans have particularly rich northern capitalists humans have made 'em to the earth\nAnd and the air\nAnd the water the collision of those things is causing massive extinction and threatening human life as well\nSo this is Kim Jong short\nOf a whole lot of things\nOut by the main the main thing is climate change I just read something or the other day which just made me very very sad and I felt like not getting out of bed I'm One third of the great barrier\nReef is dead [noise] um [noise] because of a stern yeah off of uh Australia and the coral\nReefs around this world ... are the the the aquarium for all\nFor so much of life in the oceans and when they die they are the bottom of the pyramid and the ocean and we lose so much of what is important um in in our oceans on which we depend\nNow that's due to climate change small changes in the uh\nAnd the temperatures of the ocean have meant that that corals can leach\nBut that is also added to the trauma to those corals by development in by shipping has also been added to buy that\nToxic dumping that we've been doing not just of plastics although plastics are huge but just of the toxic chemicals that we create in order to to um meet needs that we also created\nAnd then have nothing to do with ... and then dumped him in the oceans as a\nA reservoir of last resort\nBecause of the great white sharks off the coast of Massachusetts because the waters of so much warmer\nYes and then I read that my twenty fifty this is just going to be it's going to be like Armageddon and so it took me awhile to understand\nThat than we are on track to Armageddon we're on track to the end of the world as we know what can we turn this around\nReally we can turn it around but it requires\nA will of political will that starts with every single thinking person who can understand and\nEverybody this basic physical fact\nThat we are blanketing the years with our pollution and\nWho says I Am going to stop that published\nIt's simple in a way but it's actually because human lives particularly privileged northern human lives are very complicated it is also complicated\nWe the main thing that we must\nDo is to fight for our leaders to implement\nNow massive policy shift towards conservation and renewable\nEnergy okay break it down then so I understand what can I Do [noise] what\nCan you do is vote for people who say that ... that climate change and a and environmental\nUm disaster are the single most important things in our world right now particularly to the poor to the south to people of color and\nHow do people find out more about mass energy if they want to think about changing where this was the source of energy comes from\nUm go to mass energy consumers alliance on the Web\nAnd you can either do it through the website or you can call the folks who are who are indicated that on the website and talk it over but you can switch your energy you can switch or electric consumption to a wind through that\nDoes that what you have if you're at your house we have a combination and don't ask me how we do it I'm not very good at this uh we have a combination mass energy plus we have bought into co op power\nThey're they're a community shared solar they have an array in Massachusetts and if you buy and you get\nTwo things you get solar are produced electricity and you also get a Fifteen Percent decrease in your bill\nA they have an array of was I don't know what\nAnd they are a solar panel oh I'm Sorry and other you know like Harvard, Massachusetts I Can't remember where it is ... is\nIs less than because you're ... or ...\n... and in order to a follow up on that ... people please go to co op power and eat again either read through their Web site or call them because they're wonderful\nIs a complicated is this like now I got an I become a science major and I know they they take they take all the complication out of it I don't know how they do it because this is not fair yeah they they perform the magic on there and and we now\nActually we have bought our our stock of what we use off the grid is coming from the places where we want it to come from and what we need to do over\nTwo weeks that action from renewable does\nAnybody to get that I liked her a city that's come from coming from a new what do you notice\nA change in in in your house in terms of organize your gaze resented you know in order\nNot to say that you know that you've lived just wishing you still have a we\nHave electricity all this time we're very happy and energy him\nOr her [laughter]\nAnd we fly you know a little\nFar every every night or so and and then we rented around it and it acts just like any of those cards and then\nThen you will that you're hearing\nNow is Marty's husband Eliot crunching of bag [laughter]\nThe so okay that doesn't mean I went and then there's energy people can look at our ... our people can look that up and think about buying an electric car\nAnd was it difficult to set up your your plus you\nKnow we did have to install a higher voltage\nI took my husband with me on one interview in Louisa mhm he could translate and another person out on the nearby was perhaps I don't know where\nSomebody a friend of mine who live there and spoke Spanish interview that person the rest of 'em I did an English\nBecause I found out something interesting that I had known what\nI'm from the time the Americans came in and started public schools there had not been public schools um let's see we're I mean there were school for the wealthy but not for the uber also not for anybody else [laughter]\nAnd when the Americans doped up their schools they brought teachers down from the states mhm spoke\nEnglish so the language of instruction from like ... I don't know Nineteen hundred until I'm constitution day in Nineteen fifty four\nFifty two fifty to thank you ... where you saw was English\nTo well you know some ... my grandmother was one of the public school teachers who testified before a community from the ACLU or what that meant to bring in ... in Nineteen thirty to thirty three I think\nToday they're making a teaching English and a lot of them don't speak English and so that people should be taught in their native tongue and because she knew that my grandmother mhm [noise] so I'm ... I'm On there really isn't very quickly\nShe was fired from her job as a teacher and yeah and then she appealed to the first lady of the time Eleanor Roosevelt I have copies of the latter\nWrite him where she asked the first lady who as you may know we used to have a column in the newspaper right my day I have a\n... I have a book with with all the columns\nAnd so ... she was much more you know first ladies I I I guess we're much more comfortable then because my grandmother went directly to her\nIn English telling her about what had happened and then Eleanor Roosevelt wrote her back and said no you weren't for independence and Puerto Ricans need to be taught in English does nothing I can do for you essentially that's what you said\nOh and it was crushing and ever since I read that letter every time people want to create some sort of a large you know named after Eleanor Roosevelt I think of my grandmother and I think that all of us are people of our time and maybe didn't today on a Roosevelt would have responded differently\n... she was had a hard time in some ways but another way is not so much\nWell I I think I think now people are much more politically correct than they were then I mean a\nLittle being politically correct wasn't even a well as your grandmother found that wasn't an option but it wasn't even considered\nIt was like okay we're here now we do what we what yeah yeah and some right over the your grandmother and I'm sure many other people probably said that's not right right but and the stories that I got\nFrom people they told me how they hadn't been able to go to school before and now there were schools the schools were taught by Americans and I think I I was sort of what I think Spanish\nAnd all this delivery language\nRight no that's exactly what it was say when like if you want to take it you can take it you're not going to learn anything in Spanish so that was that you know help for some people that worked out to learn\nSubjects that way and even to learn English my way for the vast majority of people they could not imagine you having to learn Spanish any subject you know\nThirty five years still speak Spanish\nLike well because I think that I think that knowing languages it's like knowing music is it like you have a gift for it right you have a knack for it that's right and word person yeah ... ... for for our listeners tell us a little bit about yourself\nYou were born in raised aware and how old were you when you first one to when\nI was born in New York I was raised in Baltimore, Maryland I was a young mother when I moved to Puerto Rico with my family in the summer of Nineteen sixty\nNine and a researcher uh right after we did so I remember watching the moon walk from a um rented apartment until our furniture that we can move into a house\nI remember watching the movie was also from a swimming for who I was taking\nClasses on how to swim

children ... and you got to talk about yourself from the thinking of\nAll the things you say I'm thinking to myself while but I really do\nAll you know and I must say\nThat if it wasn't for having wonderful editors ... who encouraged me all along the way and you were no\nNo no okay yes yes yes let me tell you that yes yes in any event let's move forward\nLanguage papers and whatnot that after I started the tables magazine that I Will no longer with the papers\nUm they um Spanish language paper oh dear uh-huh meet your right restaurant reviews for them and they I wrote them in English and they translated them everybody knew I was terrible speaker [laughter]\n\nBut it was so so I Would say I happily gained about thirty pounds\n[laughter] trying to get rid of [laughter]\nBut anyhow um yeah we we had I did tables magazine which was a ball and I did a book called kids in the kitchen which has a recipes\nFor kids not from kids with four kids and one chapter are on the kids from Puerto

CBS News radio he's resource for a regional reporting on the radio and online\nThe western mass business show a Jim Hi this is Ira Britain and I can watch this show we\nExplore the or thoughts feelings the business the product the process of somebody that is doing something business see in pine your belly and today I'm Glad to have somebody that I've known for\nSeveral years Amy Wolfe who was a color consult my stuff is Uri Thanks Ira it's good to be here so why don't you just start off by describing what it is that you do for people\nSo I'm an architectural color consultant a that distinction you know I don't don't pick clothes for people [laughter] ah what I Do is I help people basically to paint colors ah it does expand into\nAny kind of color selection for the built environment so I Am involved and a lot of construction project ... people are doing kitchens\nHelp them with colors for things like flooring counter tops cabinets you know anything that comes in a color for the built environment that is basically what I Do for both a residential and commercial clients\nSo who is your customers that the homeowner of a contract or a little of each\nSometimes it's the contractor uh but the contractor will bring me in on a job muffin when progress me a need to be\nBoosted a little bit of a so if the homeowner and the project is is having a hard time making decisions I'm often brought into kind of streamline that process and keep the production schedule\nOn schedule a it many times however uh the client a homeowner the person who's either building or remodeling in those larger jobs will uh will find they just need a little extra support beyond what they're being given by the rising from\nAnd said they mostly I Would say eighty percent of the time bring me in themselves\nSo so how did this start it would seem like a you must have known that you had some special talent for seeing color that cetera\nNo actually it was probably born out of\nWishing I had more talent I grew up uh you know one of those crafty kids you know always into things and so uh you know I was familiar with art and and ceramics and you know it was always involved in those kinds of things involved in color\nBut actually a mining came out of my own renovation I was working on a a whole house remodel\nBack in two thousand five and I knew color was important and it was kind of almost a good enough at it and know how important it was but not quite good enough to get it exactly the way I wanted it on my own I needed to close that gap\nColors that you were considering we're just not making it somehow\nUm yeah there were [noise] you know ... there's theoretical color and then there's actual color and you can have a great idea and then the ... the steps between taking that idea and converting it\nInto something that ends up on all four walls is much different process has probably most of your listeners you know I mean there are so few people I run into who don't have a story about a parrot color going wrong with a pinch\nOr might be gorgeous exactly you know hundred square feet of it\nIt gets big changes and so you know here's an example I put in bamboo floors in the house in Florida in two thousand five\nBamboo it was very popular at the time it seemed like a neutral to me but guess what my band blue goes down it's yellow suddenly you have a huge amount of yellow and you're ... so it was probably one of my first color lessons was your you know would is not a neutral you know we think of it that way but it really is and\nI bought a green couch I was so sure it was green I mean it was like a light to green yeah and we got him and my wife was like a ... as long as it's not the ... put it in the house it's a huge and and I told you about that and you said is it in front of a blue purple wall or ...\nRight right well I mean there there's a couple of things going on there one is that we all perceive color differently you know we're all somewhere on a continuum and everybody's physiology is is different\nAnd the way it registers in our brain is different in the way we talk about it is is even different but really what was happening there was you know colors about relationships I always say color is what it is because of what's around it and so we can use that to our advantage we can manipulate colors\nA and colors can kind of check to us\nBecause of that so you you you got into this because of your own need to be better at finding color and then what was your training to actually become a ...\nSo as as a homeowner who was remodeling um I just did a deep dive into researching color I read everything I could get my hands on I was in the Internet you know a\n... on chat boards you know talking about design and color and then through all of that I discovered the international association of color consultants mhm and\nI flew to San Diego for a little less than a week to do my first round of color training I've actually been out there for separate times for force separate models of that\nSo I Am on your Facebook friend and I see but you travel a lot and I see that when you travel you also seem to notice the you know vivid colors of Cuba or Morocco and things like that like how does that informed your work\nWell it it I Will say my work informs my travel choice oh for sure [laughter] go through the country yeah just or just you know I mean I'm drawn to\nThese famous I'll be vacationing in um well instead carousel or next year and that's also one of those\nAnd most colorful cities so I definitely feel a poll and\nI think that one of the things that helps me a in design is you know keeping things fresh and taking in as much visual data as possible I mean I'm doing it everywhere whether I'm walking around in North Hampton seeing what's in the windows\nOr you know I'm off to New York tomorrow and you know clearly I'll be I'll be watching and looking and and feeling and noticing my own response and I I think it all goes in you know in a deep way\nAh and then you know gets a brought back out on its needed right so I call it feeding the high uh-huh I like to keep my eye well fed\nYou're okay imagine I mean if you're a dentist you walk around with new people's chief and\nFar right All right yeah you must just notice everybody's color every so hard [laughter]\nIt it can be painful actually you know there's you know you ever watch walking which fella version just for a little room [laughter]\nNo but that's probably a good idea now mostly it's um you know my roots around town go driving here and there is as the places I drive frequently you know there is there a couple of they're they're my favorite ice or some actually things that just makes me cringe every time I see them\nAnd I can't really an see that stuff you know and and likewise there are there places I find beautiful and I find their colors inspiring and\nAnd and that informs my work I'm working for a builder and Newberry port right now\nIs doing a lot of houses and doing all of his color inside and out and uh I chose the color of based on something that inspired me on them straight mhm uh here in North Hampton house have been driving by for years and a sort of ... a little riff on not for this house and Newberry port some it all goes and\n... so how much do you serve the customers face versus you'll be happy if you trust my expertise\nHundred percent customer taste I mean my job I'm a coach I'm I'm I Know that words a little overused but I'm I there are decorators end designers who when you hire them you're buying their look you're hiring them because you love the look that they create\nAnd I see my role really as more of a facilitator I Will exert my own opinion uh when I think my clients making a decision that's not the for the best uh for the overall look up the project and I will always have a reason why\nI never say just just now you know I I work hard to be able to articulate why I support is an idea or why I I think we should keep looking ... um so yeah I my job is to really unravel\nA client's relationship to design in their place and and and help them not assessed what it is and they really want mhm\n[noise] so does it ever happen that you paint a certain color and then the client hates it or you hate it and then there's just a matter of time to let it kind of just ...\nI usually tell people to give it three or four days I think any time you have a big change particularly people who've gone from you know rental you know white to something a little bit a little more verve it can be a little shocking\nSo I like to give people you know I say just just let it sit right ah I find it happens less and less longer I've been doing this work but yeah absolutely things go wrong it's often due to miscommunication mhm I think if a client is hesitant to give me full feedback\nAnd they kind of thing to themselves oh I I Know trust or you know and they don't really want to talk about it right that's when things can sometimes go wrong\nAnd for some people have imagine if you have a party and everybody comes in love with your your most struck delivered all too\nYeah you start to see the beauty of things through\nAnd then there's the nature of color like we just my kids are out of the house and we're considering turning him to be or be a beer with him and so I just let my wife I said if you if you're if I hear your final choice will tell you but\nSo my daughter's room is now with this very bold red which after she painted it well the painter told me\nRead ... kind of streaks black a little bit so what do you put it on me so this is going to need a second because you could see where there was just some you're looking at me like you're going to cover yeah it doesn't cover uh-huh\nAnd so if there's a different color underneath it will often show through depending on the kind of paint you use and what the paint chemistry is\nI mean ... while he Irish what squash berries\nTen or Fifteen Years ago before there was a big evolution and paint chemicals and prior to that painting of wall red would sometimes take five codes mhm round so\nYeah but then again in the end or I look at it in a string of it's pretty good and then my wife works out and says oh my God how did they forget that my childhood bedroom was this horrible road that's not far from\nThe wild yeah people have those childhood triggers for sure yeah so so how do you\nGo about getting business [noise] [noise]\nWell ah I Am on social media and um I don't advertise at all anywhere at this point it's largely word of mouth I'm when I first moved to the valley ten years ago\nI put in just a ton of legwork you know in terms of face to face in person networking\nOr somebody said how did you get successful I said you've got to be in the right place at the right time and I was everywhere so I was you know doing luncheon learns and chamber of events and I ... I was just everywhere and then about four years ago I realized I had kind of\nGotten enough traction and I I I'm ... to admit this on a business show but I went full stop on networking I just I just was ... and so now secret\nAs most people either have to the door or ...\nI'm good at it I enjoyed it uh but it's exhausting it said it ... it is a part time job [laughter] in a way\nSo I did that work and um you know I keep a very steady presence on social media and I don't do a lot of pushing of services um like just like to keep the word out and keep the conversation without color going I have a ton of repeat business I get a lot of referrals\nUm I'm On a site or online dedicated to designers called house in ... you can find me down house and see some of my projects and read some reviews that's been a big driver I'm somehow I have\nI seem to have good CEO people say they find me on Google I don't know how it's one of those mysteries of the international modern a competition\nThat would be some confusing\nI Do know people call me from you know again huh and I say how did you find me I Googled\nUh-huh did you work for the most we worked I yeah I Do work all over the country I had I had my first international council\nStudent of Detroit I the way it shows up on your screen as if it works like the same screen\nThere's a there's a way we sort of establish a baseline of color um I can either look at a photograph and they can tell me what the current color on the wall is ... and so I can kind of extrapolate from there and because everything will largely ...\nAnd ways we can work around that yeah\nSo I'm surprised to hear you say word of mouth I mean I'm not surprised because I Know you when it's ten people have told me about you since I've known you yeah oh that's not what I'm saying why would you recommend that how do you know that I'm looking for a color is or not right\nBut I've heard from people like in kitchen and bass that people don't recommend because they don't want to give away the secret of who fix their house so it's interesting to hear that you know it's ... wouldn't another word\nThat's that's weird [laughter] that's really interesting I don't know about that\nYou know one of my very first clients here when I moved here swarmed me to secrecy mhm I think there may be a certain element of Yankee PI why that we can do it ourselves here in New England you know and we don't need to hire decorators anyway I don't know ... decorators redness gracious\nSo um he's wanted me to secrecy is also become one of my great champion has has referred an awful lot to me since then but um so there may be some of that and their inhibits people obviously that's not going to work with kitchen and back 'cause nobody is expected to why they're\nSo this might be my last question okay the children's clothing store and I had one woman that came in she was a color separate or for her job so she really needs and then a printing industry yeah yeah\nAnd so she'd say I need black pants for my son and I had numerous black pants she'd say those are two yellow those are two green those are two red in all these black pants\nTo some people just see color so well in your career that you need to deal with them differently than the average\nAbsolutely I mean again you know I talked about that continue on that one day and the other continue and we have those who are colorblind and at the other end of the continuing we as catch will come out to sea more than ... than anybody else you know there are certain\nRight animals in insects that also seem more colors well there is news humans like that too so I think there's two things going on\nOne and basically the seizure where people taste cold\nWe need to run the Congress professionals if we went and we need to be willing to bring ideas to the floor big ideas and small ideas even some ideas we may not agree with\nAnd let's let's debate them or let's vote on them and let the chips fall where they may but that's the way the Congress is supposed to drop\nOne thing the other chamber of commerce might get done as soon as tomorrow is a vote on a new Supreme Court justice to the FBI report was delivered last night it's a top secret only the Senate Judiciary committee right now has it what do you think the odds are that Brett Kavanaugh become the next being court justice tomorrow\nYeah well I Hope not but I mean I I have to believe the ... metro card of wouldn't be rushing to the floor if he didn't feel you had the votes\nLook I I think it's disgusting\n'em and you know no matter what people feel about ah the the charges that have been brought forth by a doctor forward I mean I think one thing is clear this man does not have the temperament to sit on the Supreme Court\nThere he lays lied too much during the confirmation process and um and I get the sense that\nYou know or that if he becomes a a member of the Supreme Court\nYou know he's going to be vengeful [laughter] I mean we all talk about you know we worry about whether roe versus Wade will be overturned we worry about you know the future of you know ... ... us Citizens United types of ah of decisions we worried about voting rights protections in labor rights protections\nI I I get the sense when I listen to\nA Brett Kavanaugh testify that if he gets on there is there and make it his business to go after the things uh the progressive than Democrats have a ... I think are important and I don't I think that would be terrible for our country\nIt will be terrible for the Supreme Court with all\nThe talent out there I mean this is the best we can get a it was all the questions that are have been raised about him I mean the FBI investigation is not going to be conclusive I mean as we've learned the FBI when they do these investigations actually work for the White House I mean this is not an independent\nInvestigation at the FBI designs on its own it's a direction of the White House I don't think there's going to be anything earth shattering that comes out of it this morning probably maybe raised a few more questions or but again this is not a quarter law this was a job interview and if somebody were wanting to work for your a radio station and they had all\nThis these questions my guess as you probably wouldn't hire them\nThe only thing we like about him at this point is how much he likes beer 'cause he would fit in I hear in that regard only I think\nWell we we we know that for sure because that's the ones that you were about right uh but uh but I mean I just like you know it's really sad that were at this point um and you know I mean and and the and the goal\nRecord but this guy I I I I really I think he's had some character flaws and we're seeing even people who originally came out and endorsed him classmates or ... you know the ... the American bar association I mean they're ... they're all having second thoughts and um and I think they ought to pull this\nAnd the either continue with the FBI do a more thorough investigation\nOr just say you know we're going to find something else this is not worth dividing the country over\nUS Congressman Jim McGovern joins us every Thursday at seven thirty you can ask a question of the congressman all throughout the course of the week email me mafia W.

electronics\nWorks equipment the list goes on and on but our increased dependence on plastic has taken a toll on the environment and the it's only going to get worse most people don't know that much of the plastic we put into recycling goes to China\nThey've been importing forty five percent of the world's plastic waste since Nineteen Ninety two but at the start of this year China's said they weren't going to do it anymore\nOverwhelmingly high income countries have been sending their tactic way too low income countries primarily located in East Asia and Pacific region\nAnd so what this means is that now that China has been or has implemented their new national policy the question is where the waste now going to get them\nLet's say me Brooks of the University of Georgia is new materials Institute she's coauthor of a study measuring the global impact of China's Bannon plastic waste imports the study estimates that a hundred eleven million metric tons of wage will have to find a new place to go by twenty thirty but where\nWe definitely been seeing reports since the ban was implemented that waste is starting to accumulate and places that have long depended on exporting and so that way to the landfill maybe and center aided\nCosts they're probably going to be passed down to consumers another thing that we're seeing and the news is that other country near China also in Southeast Asia are seeing rapid increases in the amount of plastic waste that they're importing and so the problem is that\nThey don't necessarily have the waste management infrastructure to adequately manage that way and so I was actually just in Vietnam and June and they were receiving lack of plastic waste and it was trying to clog up their system\nAnd so funny enough Vietnam has actually talked about implementing restrictions about importing plastic waste as well so this is having huge cascading impact in all over the world\nSo we're all the waste will go remains uncertain and in the United states and elsewhere were already feeling the effect but why did we start exporting plastic waste to China and the first place\nBack in the nineties markets and marriage for a need for plastic waste in China so they had a really rapidly growing population which meant more ... than a need for material so\nPlastic waste and recycled plastic waste became something they could use to diversify their kind of material back to produce items um at the same time countries like the United states had implemented what's called single stream recycling\nThere a large supplies of recycled materials and so it just kind of became a supply and demand where China needed the material country like the United states had a lot of it and so it just became an official to start sending it elsewhere\nBut Brooks says now it's time for countries to manage plastic waste on their own and some areas of the world are not prepared to handle it\nEconomy and places like south east Asia and even Africa than are developing really rapidly\nMiddle class is growing there on U.S companies going and unfortunately waste management infrastructure can't keep up and so interestingly like Vietnam for example has happened much per capita waste and ration as somebody in the United states\nAt the different than that we have infrastructure insistence that collect and manage it and they don't necessarily have that\nBut even with existing waste management systems in the United states we still face additional problems even if we have places to put all of it in particular Brooks says high levels of contamination pollute or recycling stream she says if people would learn how to properly recycle our waste management would improve\nAre things that you're fulfilling he can and cannot take most later can't take Styrofoam but people fail it ended up and all that and so that actually caught their ... and that material usually end up being landfill which means that the cost is passed down to consumers by the recycling facility\nSo that's kind of an example of people just don't know and they throw in the wrong things they don't realize that that actually cost money and they're the idea called wish cycling or west recycling kind of feel good thing that people get where they think they're doing the right thing\nAll that stuff and the recycling bin and they're actually showing all her own thing and again that that has to be dealt with\nSomehow rock shows the simply having a reusable water bottle are refusing to use plastic straws can make a difference\nBut there were people out there taking much more extreme measures to eliminate waste people like be jumps she's the author of the book zero waste home and founder of the zero waste lifestyle movement\nYou waste at home aims at a meeting as much trash as possible\nFrom your household what he does do a study leads to a pro life or one that is based on experiences instead of things too old to mention you discover life that is

but you can fit your annual trash into a pint size jar or at least jumps again so now you're probably wondering how is that possible\nTo eliminate trash from your household all you need to do a follow

think to do a really good study you'd have you'd\nAnd drink one side with it in one side without it it's hard to say whether the children that those who do get better with a helmet and we do have you know eight of showing the kids\nDo get better but it's hard to say in my mind whether those kids would have gotten better with just leaving them well enough alone certainly I think if you're able to sort of keep a child's head off it all the time twenty four hours a day seven days a week there's some evidence that you know that should work but we can't do that all the time so helmet use one at night\nAnd it prevents that Charles from sleeping in any one position where you might not allow that hit to improving the chick\nTop says he prescribed how much to about twenty five to thirty percent

moderate to severe to form any or whether it's a mild to for me\nAnd then the the flip side of this is also discussing the case with the parents some parents are very traumatized by this and this is a big big problem for them or their parents are very casual about it and don't feel as a problem at all\nSo I sort of have to balance the two\nSo if the child has a sort of a a a smaller to for me but the parents are distraught over this I might lean towards that child and a helmet conversely if the child is a sort of ... a little bit more severe to for me but the parents just aren't bothered by it they really don't care for the helmet therapy than we let it go and we see how the child does\nSo helmet may be good for some in fence and bad for others but we can all agree that no one wants to wear a helmet for twenty three hours a day so are there ways to prevent a flat spot in the first place\nShape of the ... when the board\nIn the universe or how their position in the U.S wants to deliver

playing dirty pool with your wallet [noise]\n\nIt's just a moment [noise]\n\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this outrageous fee added to it if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets and hit a point of critical mass\nWhere when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all to the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly pass through and it's why I despise monopoly so much\nAnd you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about the insiders\nTicket master ...\nSpill the beans that ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money votes on the fees up front and the fees when the tickets resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks and when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets directed not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because\nI Will not pay the ticket master rip off the\nThe good news for you

the seven days all next week I'm Denise ... on one on one five and one of seven five WHM pay [noise]\nWhich brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at how much a month for I'm already\nDollars a month now and that's ... plants are Seventy five ten Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month the taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones\n... name is not anywhere to be found around visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not as that is that it's their network and so it's at forty one gotcha with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the booze is how many stores as the invisible and all they really are invisible there is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service has done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes yeah\nUh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great type price point or fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know junk food so no all included a now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteenth T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween a TNT and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other Eighteen he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nYou've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four\nForce plants to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plants and now we\nMoved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service there's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies\nAnd so you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month for bona fide real cell phone service with I'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how do you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone right plans don't change no they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all the time clock dot com thank you very much\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show how John\nPike lurk how're you doing I talk to you great to have you\nBeen doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um had a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um well\nActually I Am [laughter] I have favorite children and so it's hard to pick\nYou know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors zero [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so\nTell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFatality you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out they have\nA ton of really low cost transaction fee each yes or no minimum ... minimum wage to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign around the fatalities zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about ... had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there\nSo fidelity coming up with\nThe new product development zero\nHas set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else and so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks oh free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWhich\nSo Fidel they used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds and now they have two flavors up them they are an extremely low cost series\nOf a target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high costs will not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering so they have become much more aggressive on the front\nAnd so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talked about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with fidelity and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystems through the ... percent cash back card\nGood for you explain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nAre they two percent cash back on every every purchase he runs through and I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but um you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your ability account\nSo that he has managed to an account or they're going to be an IRA right or a college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when fidelity is doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFidelity 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower cost but vanguard really set the pattern and set the tone and took the market share\nAnd that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening

gone wrong this is the problem we have these operating\nSystems we use today are so hideously complex\nThat things can go wrong in so many different places it's not always easy to figure out what's happening is a certain amount of I think there's a certain amount of intuition that goes into solving problems like this\nAnd that intuition is built up over years of of solving problems like this I
