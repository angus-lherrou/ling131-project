Jim be [noise]\nI'm John ... and Tom Johnston of the foundation for the defense of democracy they are senior fellows they keep the long war journal which is an excellent way to watch the transformation of Afghanistan in the coming months\nAnd years the U.S has been bogged down in a combat that is very difficult summarize since the attack on New York and Washington within a month\nBut here we are asking ourselves how is the Taliban doing as it advances district after district\nBill you have a a report that have the Afghan population lives in districts that are no longer in government control\nThat is a way of talking about how ineffective the central government is in ... uh in alliance with the U.S and our allies are partners there\nAre articulate a little more what does that mean they're outside of government control what does it mean for their lives and for the future of good evening again\nGetting job yet at first to break down the numbers mean we we estimate that ... percent\nOf the population lives in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in areas that are at the end\nIt tested may mean a certain percentage is controlled by the Taliban and its percentage controlled by the Afghan government\nThese are typically the district that where most of the fighting hers because this is where the Taliban and the Afghan military or going head to head off what would it be like for that we want to be a wouldn't be very clear we can't say that the Taliban or you know in a contested area that that is we kind of consider a no go zone\n'em again this is this would be the most difficult probably even more difficult than in air that are in areas\nUnder Taliban control um areas that are under Taliban control you're going to get their harsh version of sharia you know whipping and you know they're they're all the craziness they're Islamic law that we've seen over the last several decades I'm In the areas that are contested\nUm you know you could be living in a town in in a contest that area that may be under government control or influence and the next town over a thousand is Alvin troll there's often a lot of fighting in between these areas you're ... if you're living in one of those areas that might be government control\nYou're fearful that the Taliban could be coming next the next day that the Taliban are coming to tax you that the Taliban to come to do all of those horrible things that the Taliban does\nAnd you know what we're trying to show people here is\nLook at the situation in Afghanistan is far more dire than the U.S military the U.S government is trying to tell if they're trying to paper over this situation so they got a peace deal with the Taliban but the numbers when we analyze the situation we can't come to any other any\nLemming underline that bill that President Trump made a speech I Believe it was the spring of Seventeen talking about his commitment to Afghanistan and\nAt that time we believed they were going to extend their ... extend the deployment of us troops and our allies in Afghanistan does it still look that way given these retreats\nNo it it does and what happened is you know the president said we're gonna we're gonna make the Taliban were in a beat them to the negotiating table by eating them into submission to the negotiating table instead were beating them or is it running quickly to it or within six months they they basically dropped\nThe idea that we can cause a military defeat the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations\nBy all the indication Trump was out of Afghanistan before the next election next presidential election and I suspect that's what we're going to be and you know I just think if that's the U.S policy we need to be very clear about what is going to happen to Afghanistan when the U.S leaves\nYou have a map long war journal I recommend everybody go to the map you get it right away they break it down into government control contested Taliban control and unconfirmed mobile\nAnd it very much looks like they're surrounding the mountainous center of the country I see them particularly dominating the area around ... that's the way to read this man\nYeah that is I mean look the Taliban controlling contest numerous districts in the province just south and east and north\nOf the capital and I said look if the if the if the U.S wants to cut a peace deal with the Taliban let's let's say the Taliban you know decided hey we'll make some agreement as soon as U.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they will share power and I think when you look at the geography and you look at this map\nU.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they will share power and I think when you look at the geography if you look at this map they see all the upper hand here in Afghanistan\nYes uh and it's not just around ... certainly dominated around Kandahar which is the main uh trade route and also smuggling route from Pakistan and the Baluch area\nAnd then all along the Iran border look at that they'll all on an around Iraq all contested by the Taliban has had a lot\nOf effort in the west and even shocking is the north in the areas that you know really should be the former northern alliance strongholds right up these areas are congested it's it's very concerning when you look at the end it hasn't changed for the last year was the Afghan military has not been able to be back\nThough Tom I Want to go back to Iran because we talked about Iran working with the Taliban does that does that leave out al ... or as al ... an agent some ... in some fashion about this around the Taliban relationship\nWell two things were quick John you just picked up on something that's very important what you noticed that the the territory along the Iranian border and part of the explanation for that is that Iran according to multiple pieces of evidence now it's actually hosting called on training camp to sending fighters into west or Afghanistan takeover that turf\nAnd part of what you've seen these ... these designations that came out last week we were talking on the first segment is that Iran is actually even given the orders of Taliban commanders and some of the in some instances according to the U.S Treasury Department this is very interesting in an amazing development they had already see that her twice for the call bonding these operations but it does involve okay that answer your question\nBecause of course the top armies closely allied with al ... and then I'll kind of has its own agreement with Iran that allows 'em a kite fighters to sort of trends that Iranian territory they move funds communications\nAnd other sort of white off distance reliant territory in a kite is imbedded in the Taliban insurgency so they are also deeply and\nCentcom speak of this Tom when they put out releases about a as the Taliban working so closely with al ... did they talk about Iran al ... and the Taliban the trail\nYou know very rarely will you see anything like that they they ... US military is not exactly forthcoming\nWhen he lived there for me I was going on it's left off the to connect the dots and also other department for the U.S government queen U.S Treasury department US state department they regularly report on that's\nWhy you go to the long war journal to connect the dots Tom jobs and build a road show the segment of the national security report scala leading marketing technology company visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience I'm John ... [noise]\nDifferent than Hu Jintao who was this middle of the road bureaucrat who you know it was just going to get along and play along and let everyone be happy things are very different now\nI just to note here garden you just reminded me that there's an article in foreign affairs right now I'll get the author in a moment that argues that are US Navy because it can demonstrate authority so close to China\nOr is likely to\nAh encourage the Chinese to kill maximum in any in any exchange of weapons because we can strike at their nuclear forces and they can't strike at ours easily and so therefore the situation in Asia it's far more unstable\nThan it ever was during the first Cold War when we were balance with submarines a land based ballistic missiles and bombers between Russia and the United states that is not the case with China it does not have\nThe the tri ad that Russia or a created and it has a limited amount of whatever it does have to strike back at the U.S\n[noise] yeah I I've got to read that um peace but the point is when you show weakness when you don't show I'm the U.S navy the Chinese feel embolden and that was the lesson of letting them takeover Scarborough show so you know the point is China will get aggressive when you show strength\nChina will get aggressive when you don't show strength the problem is the nature of the Chinese regime\nAnd as much as we'd like to think that we can sort of engaged China and that we can have happy outcomes\nI'm not so sure that we can you know what we can do is just try to contain China and hope that we can deter it you can't deter with weakness and unfortunately that has been the foreign policy choice of a series of presidents Republicans and Democrats and that's the reason why Trump is in such a very difficult position right now\nAnd that no matter what he does is going to be in some sense\nSome Democrats and that's the reason why Trump is in such a very difficult position right now and that no matter what he does is going to be in some sense dangerous\nThat is there is no way to re institutionalize any of this procedural safeguards on the on the president for life as communist China is there is just the nature of the regimes this was found to happen isn't it\nI think that is that it was bound to happen of course this is one of those things that you can never test 'cause you can't devise an experiment\nBut the point is your first your first statement was absolutely correct there's nothing there's nothing that the United states for any of outside power can do to ... institutionalize the Communist Party that's something that the party has to do itself\nAnd we're just in no position to influence that debate inside China\nIs is being driven by the terrorists to view the trade dispute is this being driven by the fact that Xi Jinping sees the window closing for strength because his economy is weakening into Nineteen\nYou know that is a aggravating factor John but it's something we had to do anyway because we couldn't allow the Chinese to steal hundreds of billions of dollars of us and electrical property\nThe Chinese economy was weakening already what the trade dispute did was to accelerate certain trends and certainly what we saw for instance just a few hours ago you know the Chinese currency is flirting very dangerous lead to the seven um UN to one dollar to ...\nTo one dollar mark and in the black market John you cannot get seven to one you get something like eight\nTo ... I saw that that mean that that sounded like panic garden\nIt it sounds like panic especially because if you did this a year ago you'd have a one point five percent transaction feel the black market today that transaction fees five percent five percent John that is\nA garden there is no way really the only alternative is further west the United states to prop up the Chinese economy has a very time they're stealing technology they're putting in barriers against free trade and blaze\nAnd basically Being American tell us country and they will still continue to put forward threats such as we've heard correct\nYeah I I think so if that is in a situation where you've got an hardline state you know China's moving from authoritarianism to totalitarianism you've got a leader who is in secure who is got great ideas like Mao Saddam\nThere there are no good solutions they're they're innocent nothing that outsiders really can do except to try to contain and to tear apart from that um we are helpless to you know we're ... we're we're just witnesses watching a slow motion and sometimes a quick motion tragedy in China\nOne more detailed garden about these threats from she and why way are they sitting at a tone a scene for everybody else as they speak around the world are we going to see\nThis kind of bellicose tantrum from every trade representative every diplomat are they all on a leash now does speak poorly of the United states and Europe\n[noise] yeah I think that uh the tone and see jumping is set really means that every official is going to be really difficult to foreigners because\nI'm to actually have a nuanced conversation or a friendly conversation with an American or somebody else\nIs very very difficult in these circumstances especially when you also consider that see jumping is tightening gun control in turn away so you put all this together and it just shows that China is going in directions which are extremely disturbing and the best that we can do is just pay attention to this because if we don't pay attention John\nI'm the worst outcomes will almost certainly occur\nThat is one more question how quickly does the rest of the world seem to understand us finally\nI don't think so that is I think we're coming around to a better understanding of China but we are still woefully behind developments internally which are getting worse really by almost the day but certainly by the week\nIs Caitlin how much garden that's who wrote the piece in foreign affairs which I recommend do everybody Caitlin is an associate professor of\nCable TV associate professor of security studies at the Edmund a wall school of foreign service at Georgetown this essay and foreign affairs is adapted from what China into nuclear assessing the risk of Chinese nuclear escalation in a conventional war with the United states\nInternational security spring twenty Seventeen and the short answer is\nYes yes\nNo I Know they will go nuclear because they do not have\nThe forces that Russia managed over Seventy years to offset the U.S forces this is an asymmetrical confrontation\nLed by an unstable leadership without legitimacy and a man who's making flat right now against the United states of America and declares himself president for life if that doesn't sound like a thriller first chapter what does I'm John bachelor with Thaddeus McCotter and garden jak\n[noise]\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets but the United states has master hackers to the best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly by looks like in spite\nFormer intelligence agent Eric ... page turning new thriller the tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare Eric ... new novel from done books is bite B.

Thaddeus McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes and our colleagues David ... of the Washington Examiner and CNN John Fund the national view on line and Fox News the midterms to pay off and the caravan marching marching marching\nThe latest news is that more than five thousand military personnel are headed to the border in various stages [noise] Texas Arizona New Mexico California\nThe news from Central America and from Mexico is that\nThere are there maybe two or more caravans marching young men we see video now that some of them are violent as you can understand in that heat with very little prospect of success leaving their homes and marching north for unclear purposes [noise]\nAh ... the first caravan has now about four thousand according to the latest grows and shrinks to reach the U.S border perhaps around the time of the election so\nGentlemen the polls are moving about who can tell David I start with you is the caravan a story about the polls or is this split screen election\nWell I think it's a split screen election in part because where I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is a house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's it's it's sort of headed there\nAnd the Senate that is not going to and you have two different battleground cheer you up to\nA suburban and ... battleground where opinions of Trump or\nAre mixed at best a very poor and voters interested in and making changes for all sorts of reasons\nAh and then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground bunch of red states where Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but add to it and so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races\nWhere we noted Kavanaugh episode woke up a complacent Republican electorate and got them energized when the caravan of certainly not going to be on your helpful um and it may be helpful in some of these races although I don't know if Republicans need much more help in the Senate races at this point I don't think it's going to\nBe that determinative if at all in the house and I think part of that there are now so many competing issues are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going\nYou mean issues are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\nA much fun the Trump voters in twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic wandering around this story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nI spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday\nWill be does the Trump voter turnout and that's why Trump is so assiduously going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states are running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote\nOf he's not going to any counties where she was close who lost to Hillary\nUm we will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving up the Trump vote trying that\nYou know I'm president but do no time to for relaxation the country is still in danger and that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even the tone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh he's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\nThat used to have a question a gentleman we're talking you know obviously it's a ... term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swaying the independence one way or another David\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and where Trump can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base in the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump based on the Republican incumbent Trump didn't always get along with it but does at the moment\nI think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm is kicked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big Plainfield it's become so why it even today the Republican House campaign committee\nBought advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district that a a like a Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but it all I did say there are just so many house districts are competing for because of all this\nAnger and ain't that has been motivated by a a rejection of Trump but that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house like\nJohn you know the first billionaire president ever elected as apparently encouraged lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down\nA Michael Bloomberg was obviously running for the Democratic nomination wants them scallops of all he has dumped I think in the last day or two six million dollars any single house race Dana Rohrabacher is in California which\nIs now I think the most expensive house race in the country almost thirty six million dollar spent the amount of money that is part in it has widened the playing field that David mentioned is just astonishing we have never seen a party control Congress and be so swamped in terms of resources\nBy the opposition party which is a minority\nOr it's almost as if K Street structural donors are relevant these super PACs are by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United you'll notice these super PACs in these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in the selection of the Citizens United is not benefiting the Democrats and Republicans\nAnd John as six million dollars from Bloomberg uh one district in one district because he wants to house that's it\nHe wants credit for turning the house he wants to read it for carrying certain districts he wants to establish his bona fide he's as a Democrat\nUtah Mrs Clinton teased us again John today\nWell if the Democrats take the house you'll hear more rumblings about that or it may be implausible but she says she she looks at Richard Nixon Richard Nixon was given up for dead right back to be president she could be the next Richard Nixon\nJohn Fund David ... Thaddeus McCotter I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\n\n[noise] do you teach him [noise] for tonight\nAnd if in vale is quickly removed and we see\nIt's because we know that this is a manifestation it's a cover for anti Semitism it's not a difference over a policy decision\nAnd if in vale as quickly removed and we see it received the nature of the discussion the discourse that you have this hostility on campuses in society and to change or frankly is the is the Internet with all the good that it does it is a source of a lot of evil that people\nCan communicate can be in incited that they can be instructed the violence in you know this is the eighth anniversary of Christ I don't know if the ... of November ninth Nineteen thirty eight this week and and\nWhile that was a state sponsored an organized effort as opposed to the act of an individual\nIt's a reminder that hate comes back every generation and if you don't stamp it out if you don't exercise that cancer it will metastasize and it grows and whether it's beneath the surface and then every once in a while it pops up and you you get to see it boils above\nAnd this was an incident that may be may be will be enough of a warning to people\nThat we have to watch the business that we can't tolerate you know people getting beaten up because they ... on on the street or because they have a different faith or different any any difference that separates us\nShould be really are you not unifying force to see the strength of the quilt of our society\nToo many villains too little time a quick question Malcolm his security we've ... we've always reported on careful security in New York area is that ... ... is that in some fashion reinforced now because of this\nWell certainly in Pittsburgh we met with the elected officials the police and others\nNo I mean here in New York to know and I know right so I'm saying that you know and the site and every place in NYPD course stepped up its efforts we have a meeting tomorrow where we bring everybody together\nTo address this subject that once and for all we have to make security a priority and while law enforcement everybody has its role and government has to help it's got to start with the communities and help every community because the more we do the\nMore the police can do and and that we fill in the gaps that they don't have to do and this is it has to be a priority and the the you know it's expensive it's difficult when you have such a plethora schools and synagogues and other institutions so much infrastructure here\nBut we have to find a way to improve that and that means it has to be societal because putting the band aids on is not enough\nQuickly or the Palestinians are threatening to reject recognizing Israel how do they put it in the ...\nCentral council met today this was a non binding resolution some people read it they shouldn't\nHave jumped the too much uh but they were sexually trying to say that Oslo has run its course that they were supposed to be an interim recognition of Israel until the Palestinian state was established it wasn't established because the Palestinians have been allowed it to be the ...\nSo they're talking about cutting security ties and economic ties based on the think the Ninety four Paris economic and political and or if this goes back and get actually voted on as a binding measure that will be very dangerous for now I think you know we've seen this before we see it as a\nBargaining chip um they um I don't believe that this that they will move to execute it because they will lose much more\nThat is American the prime minister of Israel made a trip to Oman would go as great\nAs it is very important in a very positive and because they allow that to be publicized even more and now they talk about it and they said that you\nKnow this the whole reaction in the Arab world to it tells you you know some of the change that has taken place\nAnd maybe the basis for further engagement that I don't know what a month economic and other ties will be but certainly it's a he has tried to the ruler of a month to bring the Israelis and Palestinians gather\nA and we'll see whether that plays out the the other big measure was today in Abu Dhabi where the Israelis won the gold medal in the in the judo in the in the classroom judo and I'm at the grand slam that's being held there\nAnd they played for the first time that pick for Israel's national anthem and the Israeli was recognized that Israeli flag on his uniform that was a minister from Israel there\nThey round up a big round of applause from the audience and attendance at say after they finished playing Israel's national anthem you know this was a point of contention because in the past they refuse to recognize the Israeli participants\nI think the way is to be congratulated wanted help people will we discussed it when we were there last time they showed us that they were moving in this direction and they have executed\nMates or if it's a really important to measure\nGods and rockets Malcolm more of the same any change in direction\nIt's more of the same one one incendiary device actually landed in Jerusalem one of the ... the ... the balloons but thirty nine rockets were fired this weekend Seventeen were intercepted two landed in Gaza and the rest just hit open areas but the\n... it looks like it's Palestinian Islamic jihad acting on orders of Iran and the revolutionary guard base that could ... forces in Syria because there's a close connection\nBetween the ... the head of a pitch the Palestinian Islamic jihad and confident and sue the money you're a good friend or John\n... who's the head of the head of the cooks for us yeah right so ... and a\nConstant mystery Malcolm as to why he's not targeted for assassination either I I'm really I'm reading again the an incident in eighty three eighty four the attack on the marine barracks the kidnapping of ... the CIA station chief and I've puzzled of myself why\nWhy why we went after ... well somebody dead let's put it that way in two thousand and eight why not until the money go ahead knock on my entire\nPoint that ... son is emerging now as a behind this this uh action in Syria where they along the border they're trying to infiltrate and set up um a a defensive or offensive presence\nBy setting up these observation posts and it's near the sun you mentioned are who are in charge of it but ...\n... ... has tried to deflect attention from a serious situation they want to keep Israel's air force and and\nJust tied up in the south so they can't focus a more in the north this is play money's orders to ... and they're trying to sabotage the understanding that Egypt is trying to reach to get a ceasefire in Gaza\nAnd so we're on once the conflict continue for the reasons I just said and uh is inciting pitch rather than just how much to actually carried out but Israel holds come off as the dominant force in the region to to account for anything that happens\nWhenever rocking to start in God's that someone has given that order and someone paid for it and Malcolm as identifying the cuts for biology could force led by

were in fact was that there aren't going to really be any exemptions to the sanctions you won't get any relief\nSo we could easily see the the amount of oil prices go up another five dollars\nAnd then possibly another five more dollars so it could easily hit Ninety\nAnd then we've got huge problems with excess capacity there really isn't much excess capacity and the entire world\nSo a pipeline into

necessarily going to see a massive decline in the economy here in Scotland I think the big\nIssue is bad Scotland has a long history of being closer to the confident that it is to the rest of the

Angeles airport getting ready to fly back here\nAnd uh he of course been covering this World Series\nOr the fourth time in Fifteen Years the red Sox have won the world series and he has done this without a moment of sleep the whole time right now on this trip just but just not today [laughter] let's figure out a David Price for just a minute what do you think is happening here because this guy or you each torn apart in the Boston Globe rats almost every day\nHe is a scene is perceived as many or to someone who chokes when the pressure is on\nAnd he was never won a game has been and many postseason games and never won one has ever perform well in one all of a sudden he catches fire here a great game in the in the ... the U.S it gets used in a truly great games here in the world series has essentially fall and so um\nHow do you live with us and now he wants to put you over here every day now what are your point about\nEssentially fall and so um how do you explain this and now he wants to pitch over here you must have been to every day now\nWell he's always have the talent and so I think it was a matter of for him all at once that will work to one his confidence would it would take over a little bit and I think that I'm trying to make it gets on\nHis psychology in some some of the mechanical but I I think he just figured it out and that doesn't happen very often but in this case it did make are really great story\nYeah ended the Congress I mean you these these athletes are you know are born with a tremendous confidence but\nTo see him asking for the wall now asking the bar all the time and being a key component of this championship amazing to watch a live without him that's the story of this World Series really when you come right now this is the story and it's all about David probably somewhere around there was a nice moment\nWe are or Joe highly came into play Kelly comes in relief and get to use ... and they called you don't own a negative she used this real meaningful embrace and he's very popular with his teammates despite what happened last year with the email to\n... definitely definitely you feel good I mean the earth and and uh those guys care about him and those guys were happy to see it come through for him after after his struggles to the ad\nThat they enjoy seeing this redemptive stories like that he didn't he enjoying himself\nAnd of course the other guy there are all space for as long as I think\nI mean this guy was just sort of a reserve he wasn't even instructed to play much and he's he became an integral part of the whole thing so so he ... he\nWas somebody that had had well again I'm against left these and now is doing well against both sides ...\nAmazing are we talking about cultural here from ... you can find his columns on mass lived dot com including one that just came out early this morning a moments after receiving the world series championship trophy for the fourth time since buying the team in two thousand to Boston Red Sox principal owner John Henry called this championship team\nWon the best of the war or is this the best team is the best restaurants theme of all time would you would you say there\nAre a little hard to argue as their regular when total the fact that they be Yankee thing that one hundred and game they eat and after that one a hundred games and and then he won the world series and they went all the serious comfortably ... it certainly statistic it'd be hard to argue with\nYou know I saw them most of the team play in August the Christian you've seen the team play a number of times I saw them play in August with David Price on the mount playing against the Houston Astros and the team the park for some reason was filled with Houston Astros fans I don't understand how that ever happened about whatever but you got\nThe impression like wait a minute you walk away from ... in Iowa but he says why the opera singer and carry them pretty insane from LA Chargers to\nJust like yeah well I mean the the way the bullpen came together and they just huge impact getting can considering how I mean I I Would have thought that would have been killing you know they they open up it's

would think you would think well anyway it's ... it's been a great series of them in great to talking to you throughout the series and are are you going to get so now you're going to get some rest that's\nThat's the plan I Am clients that I Am off tomorrow so they'll have to get back into a owned right\nThey're not sending you to buffalo tonight them to cover the ... I'm\nNot I'm not sure I'll watch it when I get home but I don't know about her\nBook math for sure you can follow him on mass ... dot com some great columns that came out\nOf all throughout this World Series I ... I Can't believe it's over you know it's it's ... you feel funny for people that have a a tickets to a game six right here in the poor guys anyway a have a safe flight home back we'll talk to you soon they bumped ...\nFrom the from mass lived through a cover of the world series and that was a conversation we had yesterday about quarter to nine\nAnd just before he got out of the year and uh yeah he was in LAX are waiting to fly home and he always says that he always gets the earliest flight that he can uh when it's time to uh to come back so yeah ... or so we'll be talking to him again but which got to be a come down when you when you are covered the world series for a publication\nIt seemed like he was plugging them in here and there are I don't know it's kind of his philosophy that everybody's part of this team I guess I don't know what are you are you make of it\nYeah I mean you know I I I agree with you eat um you know I Would I guess when you get down to you know when you get down to that um\nTo that time of the season if you're still around you know it's like a you know all the old saying all bets are off there are no rules anymore and um [noise] I think that was really do that was kind of the whole key to the series is that it's it's every single thing court did worked you know\nAnd every single thing that Dave Roberts it didn't [laughter] um I mean I thought you know it's like we're hooking David Roberts won the ... you know what was the big player in helping the red Sox win the world series you know for what he stole the base while he was the biggest player in this one [laughter]\nSo so I gave Roberts actually help the red Sox win two World Series\nRight got it it seemed like he does go by the book whatever book they've handed him about stats are doing a lot of metro cost corps did that to\nA lot of matchups to the point of distraction [noise] um I'm going to play a clip here if my computer will allow it um this was an interesting apart this was Alice court right after the game is going to the dollar is dark ... with him and he's speaking to a depressed right after the world series victory\nAnd ah he's talking about the the the parents were all there the whole all the family are all the ... brothers sisters mothers fathers aunts uncles have all the players were all there\nAnd the Dodgers stadium and he was saying how they all came up to him afterwards and with tears in their eyes here's here's Alex right here\nAt parents coming up to me and say thank you [noise] ah well you don't put my kid is amazing\nIt's not like you know how that ... percent of that process that David I'm like I was like [noise]\nAll the kids running around\nHere so that that was a very interesting I saw it and I think this was a a true of what the court does where he manages the whole team a nobody Ross on the bench and I was talking to map for twelve others yesterday that the core of being a utility infielder himself and we play\nHim he would run on the bench for two and three weeks at a time before he got and he doesn't let that happen to these guys these guys are always crashing the always kind of recycles into the lungs and that's kind of telling point where you think of these guys these big season ball players like that\nThere's still kids really and their parents with ears in their eyes and say thank you ... just like a little league game or something he couldn't believe it but that's what color is I think they just it's just kind of a special managers and\nYeah I I I I Would tend to agree with you and and you know you you made a good point earlier um [noise] you know you watch these guys on on a you know the average fan watches um you know the ... you know the ... and Celtics the Bruins especially the Bruins mean hockey players babies [laughter]\nBut yeah I mean these are you know these are they're kids they're and they're they're they're in their you know you can be a seasoned veteran at twenty eight years old they are the ones that you know that that's the young guy and um yeah it is it's um yeah I he's he just did a great job uh\nHe was the you know he was it's he seemed like he was the perfect man\nFor that team um you know a everybody got along nobody you know and you know ... about playing time and and the flexibility that he had I mean you know what you want to you and I talked before\nYou know ... ... hits with a cycle in the playoff game and then he's not in the ... not in the line up and then day which you know makes absolutely no sense at all but it's what they do and it it you know they they ended up winning a hundred Nineteen games which is just phenomenal\nHe did he put no plug pulled into the Dodgers series and you played the entire ... series block Brock halted\nAnd I was thinking that maybe he missed something here because this hotel such energy and he's like a real leader on the team maybe not an offensive leader or anything like that but he can play all night positions and he's he's ... he gets to the Indus River Johnny Jones from a twenty thirty um use of the same ilk where this is not the greatest player who ever lived\nBut there are times when the chips are down and do you really need something I didn't want up there you know the guy you want it or not I think the core figured out that ... was that guy oh just about in time because he really had an impact on these energy level everything else he really had an impact on the three games a Dodger Stadium\nA totally did and same thing with um you know with with Steve Pearce who you know was named the MVP and\nI'm a David Price completely flipped his legacy with the red Sox\nUm you know I mean really it's like he he eat and there's nothing you know people there's nothing you can say about David Price anymore like you know he just he came up and he he earned his money and and that was not the case when the playoffs\nBegan for sure so I'm a lot of redemption there for him it was it ... it was just great year special team and you know now they got the duck boat parade tomorrow\nSo and it's supposed to be a beautiful day\nSo just you know be one of those quintessential New England happenings\nRecovered the

A. yeah it's this Thursday night\nFrom six to eight it's an open house and you can come any time as a guest if you can't come this Thursday nights are open house you can email me and joined us anytime as aghast at one of our meetings just to check it out see if it is for you we're hoping that it is how could\nNot be exactly yeah I Would encourage anybody who's even curious to show up because I think there's a Woody Allen lines I maybe not like the hardest part is showing up at a party or biking the inertia and just getting there\nI also would like to encourage people\nWho don't have much experience in speaking or don't have a lot of confidence around this\nTo show up we've had speakers in that group who are not native English speakers we've had youngest ... speakers we have older speakers um it's been really wonderful to have a diverse community because it's interesting for us to hear when another stories and experiences and we all learned from that\nSo I really hope a more people can jump on this topic\nIs it's very scary to show up at something new and we don't know anybody and it's also scary to think that you're going to be giving a speech in front of a group of people do you combine those two things in it I can understand that has a tendency\nFor someone who thinks that well I don't know if I Want to go to that but really it's obviously there's no obligation to join they just come and see what it's like and it's really a supportive experience Lindsay's other does\nMaybe seven do so who is a state rep who well she will be a state rep because she has no opposition in November\nIs going to be joining us and she's going to talk about what it means to be a female voice in politics in two thousand Eighteen and and why it's so important that we have female voices in the legislature I Can't wait to hear from her\nOne of the things that you do a ... really are are are found intriguing is that you normally teach people how to speak up for themselves not necessarily a public speaking role but another rules as well but also to speak without notes the three of us are in the studio here we've been talking with a less Fifteen minutes and none of us are using any notes\nThere so I think we're very valuable to people and ... would be one of those you can speak for all of those really appealed to me 'cause I've seen that the other way where people reached up off the cell phones and not anywhere as near as\nWell it's one of the the skills that we do offer in the speaker sisterhood north Hampton on is four speakers to learn that scale because usually when we do begin speaking journey\nA women look that up there with their notes in front of them and read it they'll read the speech that they've written and that's perfectly fine and that's what a lot of speakers do they will read speech that they've written\nAbout what we want to encourage and what we see when I'm doing to the process of this journey is that they get to a point where they don't have to do it with notes or their notes are minimal they have bullet points or circles in which they've even put pictures and I'll add that\nBeyond the speaking part there's this idea of breaking out of the box behind the lectern\nI don't know how many of you sat through stultifying PowerPoint presentation or the present or it's just a zombie behind the screen and you see pictures flashing\nI feel like this group gives us confidence to use gestures and animate ourselves but in in an authentic honest way and also if necessary you know bringing some props or tell some stories\nBut the idea is to learn to engage your listener and yeah I think that is best done without a sheet of paper between you and your audience definitely and\nWe talk about things like I contact and all those skills are so important and as dean said gestures\nOr so there is a curriculum that takes\nThe speakers did start through the uh for the first year of the club and a lot of our members are wrapping that you're up and Angela Lucy or who founded speaker sisterhood is going to be joining us\nAn unveiling the second year its curriculum sorry to hear that too you know this is going to be Thursday Thursday night this Thursday night six to eight pm here WHM pets to speakers sisterhood north Hampton first anniversary open house\nGoing to be cake and please a email me our speedway at Denise votes out of law at ... dot com\nWell thank you to use our news director and thank you for club member ... thank you for coming in lake Eugene Oregon and they'll say out for using the word stultifying which is what about all\nShe has great great vocabulary and such a pleasure\nWas affected you think you know it's actually these regret the southern no twenty ignore morning here on a ... a W H um be a little bit later we'll be speaking with you light demon who's a part of cycling shabby\nAnd as you remember just a couple of weeks ago uh East Hampton are created this concept of allowing bikes to take the lane to ride in the middle of the lane\nA look to visit these Hampton if we will on the union street caught history we very narrow especially caught history so it's very narrow right so you're going to ride traditionally a cycling through the ride on the right hand side\nYou've got all kinds of danger there from doors slinging open in front of you and you don't want to really be in the right side anyway because of the class and everything else but you've got this other issue where you do have two lanes there so you got cars coming in both directions the cars going to go ...\nOr no to to avoid hitting you putting his or her self in the other way now the oncoming lane so there's hazards here all the way around if you don't actually take the link correct\nRight yeah I mean motorists often do kind of irresponsible things like try to pass when there isn't enough room to pass to go into oncoming coming trafficking us the cycles had have the power to get them not to do that ... to to make them act more safely around you\nGive us there's a video that the American bicycle Education Association which you are a part of put together that seem to be a little bit I mean I think for some of the counselors right\nYeah even one city councilor set it absolutely changed his vote on the ordinance\n... I Know the woman a counselor or with the ... he had a little bit of problem the I think he was the only one that voted against it he\nSaid that a motorist would be in shock to see a cyclist right in front of them in the middle of the road like that in the middle of the lane is that something that motorists than people in general have to get over that is of course since he right that this could be a shock to someone's system by seeing him as\nWell I think it's a little bit right what's right is that yeah motors now not all of them I mean some take it in stride but some motors get freaked out ... when they see a cycle is controlling the lane I totally agree with ... that education is important I mean that's\nI put a lot of effort into trying to educate people about this\nWhat I what I think is wrong about is that that interacts with this ordinance at all it you know there's ordinances really for people who are in how to drive defensively and feel comfortable doing it and it's not really going to I don't think it's going to get anyone to suddenly radically change their behavior\nIn terms of like game and by the way from cycling savvy\nI'm One of them was was brought up was that motorists cyclists I should say coming in from other towns who are used to this idea of taking the lane then they come before this or this was changed then they come in East Hampton they could be violation of the law so a lot of us was was sort of compliance right\nYeah that that's how some of the counsellors saw it and as I said I I really see this as a change in emphasis ... not in the D. notation of the law but it certainly is a change in emphasis that encourages people to interpret it in a in a way that's consistent with with other laws whereas before they they might have been tempted to misinterpret it\nSo if we if we go and he's camping out here in the center of town\nAnd you're going to say take a left there by biggie or something you're going to be a new industry then you're going to work your way up the caught history sure those streets would be a perfect example of this yeah the traffic was fairly slow very narrow this would be the ideal time to take the lane we've seen in there for safety and for many other reasons\nAs you go further along now you're off the street you're going to take a ride on to Holyoke street traffic is going to be going faster the length of water that would be a situation where you would move over to the right\nThere is no kind of always do this never do this there's there's really an enormous number of factors you have to take into account so you have to look at OK Holyoke street\nThe lane is yes it's a little lighter but it's it's not even close to wide enough for cyclists motorists to be safely going next to each other and the land right\nAnd you know instead of having about what like\nTen feet of useful Stacy maybe up twelve feet of useful space in right now for going faster though yeah traffic is going is going faster that's true it's definitely narrow enough that I Would control the laying quite a bit of time\nBut also there there's another technique that we teach called control and release ... where you can use you know certain spots are features are gaps in traffic to kind of help motorists pass\nOr so for example I might control the lane when there's oncoming traffic 'cause they don't want someone to try to squeeze between me an oncoming traffic\nBut then when there's there's a gap in oncoming traffic than I might move to the right and maybe even wave may have someone on to you know to to help and say yeah now is a good time to pass\nOn ... point here should there be signs should they be signs along especially on a place like cottage street or something like that should that be something that would be obvious to me a lot of motorists who've never been these happen before a lot of cyclists who never been in these happen before should be some kind of signs there to let people know like what's going on well\nSo they said they'll they'll on East Hampton isn't any different dino Tate of leave from the la anywhere else right however there there are signs and and markings they're often used to try to get that message across a there's the bikes may useful and signs\nAnd there's a the pavement marking called a ... or shared lane marking which\nHas the same meaning you see you see them in a lot of places sometimes used correctly sometimes use incorrectly my personal opinion\nWhich has the same meaning you see you see them in a lot of places sometimes used correctly sometimes use incorrectly my personal opinion is that they can be really useful for starting a conversation but you have to\nHave something to back it up something when people start to see that sign or that mark and say what's that you have to be ready with a good answer for them otherwise it's a wasted opportunity and I see a lot of these things put up with like no kind of education plan ready for when

... and funeral home and hadn't built new hadn't kills New Jersey has confirmed this Campbell Soup official said the New Jersey resident was the driving force behind the popular dish\nGreen bean casserole made with green beans and cream of mushroom soup and talk with crunchy fried onions how\nYoung companies said\nWrestling ever to come out of his former kitchen to the recipes website to point seven million visits\nDuring last year's holidays the company said the original recipe card was donated the national Inventors Hall of fame\nThe statement goes darkest Riley was an incredible woman whose legacy will live on for years to come she will be missed by your Campbell colleagues and all those who were impacted by or creativity and generous spirit\nAnd that rotted was eight Campbell Soup kitchen supervisor Nineteen fifty five when she combined the ingredients of the now legendary green bean casserole for Associated Press feature in a two thousand five ab interview marking the recipes fiftieth anniversary\nRiley said she didn't remember having a hand in it because the ... was among hundreds that were created during the time of candles\nShe also helped create a tomato soup meatloaf ... ... ... a tuna noodle casserole and sloppy Joe like super burgers my mother was big on a sloppy Joes um I never got appointed lifting and sloppy would be the operative word\nNow uh so we're talking about on the green bean casserole talking about dark as widely just died at the age of Ninety two in New Jersey and she was the I guess the inventor of the green bean casserole now my personal experience with the casserole\nOr this would have to do now as you know and I said this many times when I talked to Bob hikes the teacher and all that I Would not call myself a very a handy around the kitchen and I'm not to what you would call much of a cook\nI've done some things over the years when the uh the the kids were playing hockey for instance I could I could boil water for spaghetti I could make Mac and cheese you know that kind of thing\nI think I told you before about my favorite thing where I made the a big pile of Mac and cheese for all three of us to eat while Amory was at work\nAnd for some reason and I don't understand this at all\nUh you know you put a little milk in it you know just doing\nAnd uh for some reason we had a a gallon of milk in the refrigerator there was all like with ours letter word and stuff that made it look like orange juice or something right so I remembered that okay to make sure I don't make that mistake instead I take the real orange juice and dumped at him with the macaroni and cheese so that went over real well\nAnd so we actually had to stop at McDonald's on the way to hockey practice you know so that's that's a ... it's about how good I Am in the kitchen but um I get this idea wants to like I really should do some of the cooking you know take a little bit of the the heat off Amory this was many many years ago I was sitting at a dentist office okay\nAnd I'm just flipping through the pages and there is\nThe green bean casserole and the recipe for there's a big you know ... Campbell Soup can is on the cover and all that\nAnd I go up to ... green beans I think I can handle that I Know where to find them a and cream of mushroom soup well obviously that will be in the suit by our Campbell's keeps they're stopping crunchy fried onions Adam won't be hard to get okay\nI think I did need help on that part I probably had to ask them up a store where to find those but so anyway I um I Do this now I just might have been my first time actually following a recipe I think I took the page out of the magazine or something and do you know how people do that they take a page out of the magazine and you know screw everybody else off that's going to read this thing later 'cause\nThere's probably a story on the back of it even though I got the recipes are a raft follow this thing religiously I was kinda proud of myself right now you made the beans and all that and I got the ... mushroom soup and the the crunchy onions and the whole bit and I may green bean casserole\nSo Emory who has a a\nI Would say she has a long day at the office would say oh she works hard she's a gymnastics coach and she she works a sweat shall we say and so when she comes home at the end of the

green bean casserole for dinner\nAnd look at this and so she kind of gives you this plenty look okay and then she's looking around right around the kitchen for something else\nOr expecting like an entree to come with this I didn't know until that moment that the green bean casserole is not meant as an entree this has meant as a side dish to go with the main course that's basically what the green bean casserole [laughter]\nShe's looking around with him in court and here I Am thinking I'm you know the the second coming to Julia Child here\nYeah so it didn't make the impact or she she said

it and I think this is a a true of what court does where he manages the whole team a nobody rocks on the bench I was talking to map for twelve hours yesterday that the core of being a utility infielder himself and we play\nA game he would run on the bench for two and three weeks at a time before he got and he doesn't let that happen to these guys these guys are always crashing the always kind of recycles into the lungs and that's kind of telling point where you think of these guys these big season ball players like that\nThere's still kids really and their parents were ears and there are just say thank you thank you just like a little league game or something he couldn't believe it but that's what color is I think there is a is this kind of a special managers and\nI I I I Would

know they they ended up winning a hundred Nineteen games which is just phenomenal\nHe did he put no have you plug into the Dodgers series and you played the entire ... rock wrote it and I was thinking that maybe he missed something here because this guy hold has such energy and he's like a real leader on the team maybe not an offensive leader or anything like that but he can play all night positions and he's\nHe's ... he gets to the Indus River Johnny bones from a twenty thirty and\nHe was the same ilk where this is not the greatest player who ever lived\nBut there are times when the chips are down and do you really need something I didn't want up there you know I think the caller figured out that ... was that guy or just about in time because he really had an impact on these energy level everything else he really had an impact on the three games a Dodger Stadium\nA totally did and same thing with um you know with with Steve Pearce who you know was named the MVP and\nI'm a

spot a rat and that\nAnd this is something that needs to have attention drawn to it\nBecause when these men and women are willing to fight for you and me for\nOur freedom and our safety and security we need to make sure that they are treated right that the promises made to them are kept and the the uh basic circumstances in which their families will\nBe proper and safe and sound for them we need to fix this now you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n[noise] an official methods for Medicare open enrollment ends and so now it's time to be open mind looking everything like prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plan insurers why because crime strange so can you help me I found lower costs arm extra benefits aren't saved money open something better\nBut the point is that if prices what really matters\nThe odds are you are going to pay less if you go third party\nYeah the hotel chains are also doing something else to their um various levels of frequent flyer frequent flyer frequent stay customers that are in the hotel loyalty programs if a book first party\nThere are going to be a number of additional benefits they're offered\nBut if they both third party they're not going to get a room upgrades a free cocktails\nFree breakfast private lounge access whatever those things get wiped away many times if you book third party so generally people who bought\nWho are corporate travelers and our booking through their employer they don't care the employer pays more for the room they are going to want to book direct but if it's your money\nAnd you care\nNo that booking direct will almost always not save your money like Hilton promising but cost you money Molly's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Molly\nHow clerical area great thank you Molly you got a question for me about working somebody's private residence\n... we're taking a family trip to Tucson, Arizona I got it for family members to are flying in from different airports\nMy husband and I well the needs are adult children there and we're interested in looking a little you know through one of the big on line a little a booking site sort of looking at booking shows and we saw one that we really really would like to book but the cancellation fee is\nThe entire price of the rental there's no cancellations unless\nThe owner of the holy book [noise] and\nI guess boy that you have a rude old and that's brutal because if your family plans evaporate somehow you're out how many thousands of dollars\nA over three thousand\nYeah that that is an uncomfortable level of risk so that are in the rental\nTrade with there being be or B R B our home away\nThat's known as strict cancellation when you just for for the money and it varies by property what kind of cancellation you face some give you a period of time up to some much time before a rival before it becomes\nFully non refundable others phase in how much money you lose at different stages so far out from this day and if it's one that the second you book it becomes totally non refundable I wouldn't do it I in fact in my own life I won't do it\n[laughter] well they're they're out that we decided to take the one at a half up front and then the other half sixty five days prior but the owner indicated that we would get a full refund minus the ... percent is the property is read books but how would I Know that I\nWould not on the way to not right and you wouldn't know that if they're moving somebody may but part of this day and not the whole thing saying why do you get so I Am with you and I are you\nOn V. R. B. O. or home away or air being being where even looking\nI'm looking at both the bill and a formal way and the other option we consider because we did like the property was going to ensure my trip and an insurance you know obviously the the full cost of the rental\nBut I really was elected to eat and pay more money on top of that\nI understand I Would I Would go also to Arab BNB\nYou familiar with there being be oh yeah yeah\nYeah and and their platform you pay through them and every every listing you see their explicit up front\nWhat the policy is on cancellations and you'd be able to see who has a cancellation policy that you would be comfortable with and could live with\nExcellent and that would be an alternative to Shannon Tucson there are so many beautiful resorts that you don't have to feel like you only have one you could stay up\nA well we're headed there for brewers spring training so we're going in the end of February so we're we're going to stay down in Tucson and had up to stand next to the game\nWell all I can tell you say you're from Wisconsin\nThat's all I can tell you is you're going to feel like you're in the desert version of Wisconsin because in February there are so many people from Michigan Ohio Indiana and Wisconsin in ah Phoenix Scottsdale and to sign that you feel like\nWhat's going on here [laughter]\nYeah and Wisconsin in ah Phoenix Scottsdale in Tucson that you feel like what's going on here\n[laughter] perfect like well I so appreciate the healthy\nAnd have a great time wherever you end up staying there\nAnd is it my week is that I Would say your name ... pi sorry I mispronounced welcome to the car coward show\n... is such an honor to talk to you said thank you for all you do to help the American people\nWhere you're trying to say that thank you how can I help you\nSo I was going to get your um push bake to about a tiny homes\nAnd is it will or is it a little on to live in a tiny home for a little bit to shave so he can ... your own home and pay for it I'm dead tree [noise] [noise]\nYeah so what is the tiny home movement has lost a lot of steam and the last couple of years you know it was it was really really in a few years ago but people have found it difficult to live in less than four hundred square feet\nUp so now people are when they talk about living in a smaller home generally it seems to settle down to around a six seven hundred square feet which gives you just don't want to do more\nRoom to live without an enormous increase and the cost of construction or any of the other expenses because with a tiny home if you're living in something under four hundred square feet\nYou have so many of the same costs as you would in a larger home you've got to run utilities to it which is a big expense you may have permitting costs and the rest now sometimes with a tiny home\nIt will be on wheels so that it avoids some of the expenses he would have otherwise would where exactly are you what are you thinking of in your own mind like how long a period of time and how many square feet are you thinking you could be comfortable in\nA so that he lives in Florida [noise] and I know they're not very common here and I was thinking maybe like six hundred\nSix hundred and thirty ...\nWhich would not truly qualify as a tiny home movie a smaller home but one thing is you got to think about resale so you're thinking of doing this from the ground up\nIs the ... and uh\n[noise] I Know somebody that can ... thousand dollars\nWow that's cheap\nYes so\nAnd you got to check out a zoning requirements in the county in central Florida you'd want to build will they permit a dwelling of that size and what other things are they going to require\nBut if if I were thinking of building something really affordable I Would also like you to think about a potential for resale in nine hundred square feet which is\nFifty percent larger than you are thinking about you can within an efficient building design you can build a three bedroom\nOr one or one and a half bat home\nAnd then you have something that when it's no longer where you want to live you have something that has a much likely or market value to sell to someone else or as an ideal size for rental property\nYou wouldn't go with the idea is that what you're saying\nI Would not go as small as six hundreds okay but if it were me I Would try to go a little larger even if it meant thirty thousand becomes a forty five thousand\nOr the so called a side of the whole you\nKnow it would not would not fit the definition of a tiny home but six hundred doesn't really either\nYeah and it will be on wheels rate\nIt would not be on wheels are you thinking staying on wheels that six hundred\n[noise] shoot thinking about a year\nOr so that's a different kind of decision and uh you know I may be wrong on this but I think\nAnd has your eagle picked all the ... and only has the arrows left\nI guess has that joking about the health on nuclear Armageddon

shopping season the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season\nIs just days away and did you know there was on official start and I'm going to fill you in on what kind of things are out there to entice you this shopping season right I got a crazy thing for you\nYou know there are now the monitors being sold that are geared specially marketed towards families with young children where the the monitor hooked up to the Internet\nAnd keeps records so when you call the pediatricians office and you say a Jane is not\nDoing well and and they'll ask well have you taken or temperature you say yeah at one thirty seven her temperatures blah blah blah I at for fourteen it was this and now at eight oh two is spot on law\nAnd that's the kind of thing I can tell you as a parent of three who were all past that stage now I Wish something like that it existed when my kids were young and you'd call the pediatricians office and you say well I took it I don't remember was that this morning when I take that temperature so\nHaving the ability to\nHave the Internet be your record keeper and be able to track\nIs often is your advice to take temperature of a kid who's not feeling well having those records instantly your fingertips seems like a great idea\nBut listen to this creep out thing so one of the the monitors that is always connected to the Internet is that cancer\nAnd so this one now is and half a million houses New York times reports that cancer is taking the data\nOn all the people having their temperatures taken at all times around the country and then supposedly\nTaking it down to ... uh anonymous data that tracked by ZIP Code and then they sell it to companies that benefit from when people are sick\nJeff joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Jeff\nHey color it's great to be on your show\nWell great to have you here Jeff how can I be of service do you\nYes sir I was curious how I could not have to expect the income tax return here and figure out a way to take money out of my paycheck and put it into a savings account destroyed check at the end of the day or\nSo you're right now over withholding and you're ending up having to wait for a big tax refund each year yes\nAll right so there is no a science to his more art and the easiest way to do it unless you suddenly have gotten a big pay raise at work\nIs I did actually oh congratulations\nSo your payroll office will tell you with your normal exemptions what you're going to end up with this check in that check each pay period you increase your withholding so less money will be held back\nOkay so is it better to do that then that do exist myself altogether in and take a percentage to save as ago\nSo how do you work for a big company that has a human resources department or payroll department is a tiny employer\nThis big big flare\nSo there is a big employer you can go to a human resources and say here's what I wanted to do I want to reduce my withholding each pay period by X number of dollars\nHundred two hundred or whatever and they'll just help you do that they'll help you change the exam and it'll tell you fill out a new uh\nDriving the deck stacked against you having poor tax treatment also has exceedingly high management and insurance charges in it that are as much as forty times what a low cost investment choice would be\nSo that's not a full comprehensive vets

where the prices are going to end up and I'll take it by screen size for personal TV's the prices are likely to be Seventy bucks or so\nSo if you want to thirty two inch TV for dinner like on a kitchen counter or whatever being able to buy that for around Seventy dollars is likely where that's going to be most popular screen size\nTends to be right around a forty inches a lot of TV's now used to be forty or forty two are now thirty nine or forty three don't know why that's just the way it's played out\nIn those TVs are going to be below two hundred dollars and not all of them but the lead price the L cheaper price is going to be in that range fifty inch screens\nAre going to be a down below a hundred and fifty dollars potentially and so think about that that you're going to find that\nYou're going to be able to maybe one store\nBuy a fifty inch for equivalent or less than another store is selling a forty three inch TV so watch that compression in price with a larger sized TV a lot of people buy TVs thinking about uh how much\nHow what size of a TV they're comfortable and they only shop within that if you have a little flexibility watch the the fifties because of the competition that size may actually be a better price\nThan the smaller screen or equivalent\nAnd fifty five which are very popular\nIn people's living rooms are going to be extremely cheap this year I mean I'm Talking really really cheap and we'll see how others play the game over time\nBut don't be surprised if you see them in the low twos for a fifty five bigger sets also going to be extremely cheap and as soon as we have\nAds week just as we do every year at Clark deals dot com will make sure you're up to date on what the actual offers are they will start rolling in in about the next five

you are for yourself is that right right right oh anything older than six years I Would ditch okay\nAnd how much of the information is sensitive that if you were to dump it in a trash can a dumpster diver the theoretical diver would have a field day with your identity and your information\nWell that's the thing about ... status of al subset of those\nExtremely ... extremely I have a lot of those do you own a ...\nLittle unfair [laughter] I'm ...\nI'm a ... few crazy trying to ...\nI'll be doing it for the rest a year\nBut compared to like if you go to a commercial shredding service figure you're going to pay like a dollar a pound\nRise so I two or three hundred dollars is what it's going to cost me\nYeah so I Would rather see you buy a a shredder that will allow you to do what we might call medium volume shredding I have one that I bought for it was like fifty nine dollars for that can cram like twenty sheets and the time\nAnd it make are awful racket and my kids have gotten too old now but I used to pay my kids to shreds for me and they thought they were making a fortune when I'd give him a dollar or two to do it\nBy bet yeah so do you have any kids you can rent them the shredded oh are you at a\n... I got a transit twenty five year old so I don't know if it's out\nThere that's not that's not an aging you pay a dollar or two [laughter] so I guess I got or you need to have some mindless TV on and just sit there and shred stuff went after another\nSounds like a plant that\nBecause you said you had hundreds of pounds right\n[noise] yeah at least two or three other adults\nYeah that's 'cause that's hundreds of dollars you don't want to pay that kind of money to pay a commercial shredder to do it sometimes credit unions will have a shredding day trying to attract new members where they'll shreds stuff for free but I don't even know how you find out when credit unions are doing those free shredding\nDays what a neat idea Tim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tim how're you doing\nVery Well Howard thanks\nWell great to have you here you have a question for me about home insurance is that right\nYes I Do I like to purchase a condo or town house and the Los Angeles county\nLike concern and fear is that showed an earthquake happened in the entire building complex isn't covered by the earthquake insurance via the homeowner's association that I could possibly lose all my equity in my unit and even not have a place to live as well\nYou are correct so we you know usual in a condominium that they would go which euphemistic Lee called self insured to rebuild the buildings for ah the aftermath of an earthquake\nOkay so when you're looking at a condo you can request from the seller ... they provide you\nAll the documents on the condo association and they have to supply you that if you request it including you want to see what kinds of reserves the condo has\nAnd if it's not disclose do you want to know what kind of insurance coverage they have in in addition with that there's a crazy thing with condos have you on the condo before you know I have not\nSo Tim this is one that's like freaky weird okay\nLet's say there was forget earthquake let's say there was a um a fire or some event that caused significant damage to the building and it had to be rebuilt each condominium\nBesides in their bylaws what they're responsible for and the homeowners you still have to have like a condo owners policy and you've got to make sure the condo owners policy you get matches up\nWith the where it takes over where the condo association its policy leaves off\nTo some of them might not even re sheet rock your condo and leave that to you after a destructive about\nOthers might include flooring others might not include new foreign it's not like a traditional homeowner's policy you're condo owners policy\nHas to be written so that it doesn't leave gaps between what the condo association coverage is and what your policy would cover now in the earthquake\nYou so you don't know yet if the condo association has earthquake insurance\nI Do not I I look to see if they do and as you mentioned it is extremely rare that had a choice they would have a earthquake policy for the entire complex very rare\nSo the ... the risk to you can be intense\nVery substantial\nNow are you going to have a mortgage on this condo\nYeah although I wouldn't they tend to pay it off the within say five years\nSo the the mortgage company will probably have a requirement that you have some level of insurance including for earthquakes to lower the risk to them in the event there was a catastrophic loss that you're building\nThat makes sense you know I'm aware that you can get insurance for inside the EU and that\nYeah that's what I was remembering too about the policies that match up with the with the condo association policy and you do need to have that ... depending on your mortgage lender they may or may not require that from you but you definitely want to have that\nI agree with that but I wouldn't be surprised that the mortgage company but not also require the H o away to a mortgage or earthquake insurance tire complex\nA ...

welcome to the Clark Howard show you got an out of the blue unusual offer from your power company tell me what they offered you\nWell um they offer basically they are looking for customers to lead solar panels\nNow I Am a familiar with the son of that as I Know how they work um what I Would like to know is how my company um cost wise what helped me installing them will they be on leave or what the benefits for the average person\nSo with solar panels the leasing offers have been declining in the country and more and more people are moving to buying solar panels been leasing them\nWhich is leasing solar panels generally doesn't save you enough money and the same time you're creating an obligation for at least they may go way beyond the time period you're\nGoing to own a home yes so I don't recommend doing any of those so where were you sing offers unless\nYou you pay for them up from it's not a good deal to have 'em lease\nIs that what you're saying right right and even if it means you finance the panels but you own them yeah I'm fine with that but doing a a ... I don't like those deals really at all and I know\nBecause you don't have to wait any money out up front people think that those are there's like a no brainer no risk kind of thing\nBut I think there's too little reward for the obligation you take on and that's why I Would say you know [noise]\n\nDoes your dog each scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die for our border and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried sail except died of I\nWe are have been with our company for thirty three years and we just got a letter of non renewable effective January third on our homeowner's insurance [noise]\nAnd I must have made a claim\n[laughter] well we did we um we had a ...\nOut of two years ago and it was a water heater and um I was really in close contact with the agency asking for them to kind of advice on how much we absorb or you know file\nAnd then uh this summer we had a refrigerator lines later that took out or wood floors and um that with both of them are totally unexpected both were totally resolved it they treated us really well and the claim resolution process\nAnd gave us no indication that we were going to get hit with this letter and um basically non renewable\nSo generally with homeowner's insurance the phrase the industry uses is use it and we lose it\n[laughter] yes and you're\nThirty three years before these uh claims you hadn't back to back when you said two years ago and then recently how many claims that you ever had against the homeowner's insurance and the prior thirty one years well\nWe have had three different we've lived it for different homes in three different states and we had no claims on any of those previous homes\nWe've been in this home for ten years and unfortunately had for a December when we first moved in there was one water issue with the water here line and then we had a catastrophic uh hail storms in a rift needed to be replaced\nSo that was the first one is two thousand six with the water line in the water heater and\nThen you know that's a long time ago to ask you this do you have even the famous memory how much that claim was ...\nI have it right here because they told me what it was and I'm In the water heat it was two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars\nYeah I have it right here because they told me what it was and I'm In the water heat it was two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars and so we shouldn't even filed that but we asked them and they didn't really seem to give us any good direction on you know how to make that call\nA we had a thousand dollar deductible at that time [noise] uh in the last two years we started at a little too I think it was I don't know half a percent into like Eighteen hundred dollars\nAnd um so they only paid out twenty three hundred you know way back in two thousand six\nSure All right let me tell you the cold hard facts here and this is you are such a positive person by the way well most people would be just like steaming and you're so positive and upbeat about this but the reality is\nThat homeowners insurers many of them if not most of them judge you now based on a number of claims rather than the dollar amount of the claims and it doesn't even matter that you've been with them thirty three years\nIf they've decided that recently you become a frequent climate or they don't want you\nAnd so it's a double whammy because now you have do you know you have something called the clue report\nI just found that out here\nAnd we report um follows the house not you write so even when you go to sell your house somebody coming to buy it may have a hard time obtaining homeowner's insurance because they've ah put you through the clue process\nAnd when you go to buy now you're going to have three years of having to buy substandard homeowner's insurance that will basically just pay to rebuild your house in a catastrophic loss\nOkay well we have called around and talk to an insurance broker that deals with eighty agencies and several of them just right out of the gate refused to write us because of the last we had a preferred rating insurance score which meant that we were just spotless um until the ... kicked in and we had those two that showed up\nSo it looks like our insurance is going to double um because of that\nGoing in and it'd be crummy coverage now\nWell it it looks like it's going to be pretty calm purple\nThat's unusual can I make a suggestion sure I Would I Would accept a lower quality insurance policy by that I mean with a beefed up deductible much higher deductible\nBecause it's really important now that you only make a claim if you have something that's gigantic\nSo wouldn't numbers gigantic\nSo it depends do you have a mortgage still on your own\nNo ... we just pay that off\nOkay great so you're free to do the deductible you wish and I'm going to tell you to look at something maybe in the range of ten thousand dollars okay\nAnd then you may be able to get the premium back down to where it was and then only if you did have something truly that was terrible would you be making a claim\nRight and so we need to be prepared to just pay out of pocket like the first ten thousand dollars regard lists\nExactly and hope that nothing I mean you've had a bad run with having these things happen maybe your ... run out I Hope so and you don't have a good long run with nothing happening but the key for for your fellow listener is that with homeowner's insurance\nYou'd want to do the higher deductible gets you a lower premium anyway and up to whatever your mortgage company would allow your case that's not a factor because you want to be in a position that you don't get fired\nFor a plane and then have the problem where you're going to go next so it it's just a it's a real issue that the insurers only want you for your premiums they don't want you for your claims\nJustin joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Justin\nHello or how are things going for you Justin oh they're going just fine well good how can I be of help to you\nYeah I'm I Am a I'm I'm a masters student and my wife and I we both made it through undergrad with no debt and we work full time I worked full time while she got her masters and I'm going back to get by\nAnd what are you getting your masters I'm\nI'm getting my master's in industrial design\nOh you're going to have your job prospects aren't you ah hopefully so [laughter] that's great\nBut neither one of us have ever oh the credit card ... no credit I mend steered away from that for my entire life and we had when my wife I went to get our first apartment my dad had to co size\nOr that I felt bad right\nYeah it did [laughter] actually I've looked into your website and I've looked at real war and the best rewards cards\nThat not just for you right now they're not going to warrant you\nSure [laughter] and that's what I was going to ask you know what is the best starting card that we could get because it's all I mean all we want to do it all our credit we're interested in really traveling are award\nOkay so here as a grad student I don't know if you'll get the same\nOffers an undergraduate would be eligible for playing a college student card\nIs what you really want because they don't care about income they figure you know college students are very low level risks and tend to whatever card they get first they tend to hold for a long time it's not a lifetime\nAnd there's a real loyalty factor would be in that first car have you tried to get a car to under any of the college student credit card programs\nI've tried a lie no way I have my bank account with ... sorry\nThat's fine I don't know of regions offers a college student card but if that's where your customer go into a branch and find out\nOr you know we have we got in there and my wife ... ... have or is that for like three months now it's just something that we wanted to do\nBut neither of you have a credit score\nRight they're not gonna issue your car is not going to help to apply for that card and that's why you've got to get in there under one of the college student programs as the first best option okay and if that doesn't work then the best thing to do is\nUh the credit union at your campus\nMhm is to go to the credit union and see if you can do if they don't have a college student card if they can put you in one of the um one of the cards where you put money in savings and credit union and your limit is based\nLoosely strictly by what some savings and then you graduate fully out of that typically in six Eighteen months into a regular old card\nLucy or strictly by what some savings and then you graduate fully out of that typically in six Eighteen months into a regular old card that will help you get older your credit standing\nOkay and so that you get it done and having credit is a good thing not a bad thing mhm oh yeah this using credit is a terrible thing\nRight and that's yeah that's where I Am yeah that's where we are now I guess is I'm I'm very certain that I'm not going to be spending money that I don't have no way to screen to\nDinner you can make it through your grad program as well with no student loan borrowing\nIt is looking like that is going to be the case I I that is well rough so wait so you and your wife will each have gotten bachelor's degrees and possibly both get master's degrees and not have won sent a student loan debt\nI yeah I only go so I couldn't believe that left I mean I Know we've got a book is elbow watch how reason was would there be\nTo put that
