the product the process of somebody that is doing something business see in pioneer belly and today I'm Glad to have somebody that I've known for\nSeveral years in wolf who was a color consultants my step you hearing me Thanks Ira it's good to be here so why don't you just start off by describing what it is that you do for people\nSo I'm an architectural color consultant a that distinction you know I don't don't pick clothes for people [laughter] oh what I Do is I help people basically to paint colors are it does expand into any kind of color selection for the built environment so I Am involved in a lot of construction project\n... people are doing kittens I help them with colors for things like flooring countertops cabinets you know anything that comes in color mhm for the built environment that is basically what I Do for both a residential and commercial clients\nSo who is your customers that the homeowner of the contract or a little of each\nSometimes it's the contractor uh but the contractor will bring me in on a job mountain when progress me a need to be this did not let them at a uh so if the homeowner and the project is is having a hard time making decisions\nI'm often brought into kind of streamline that process and keep the production schedule\nUnscheduled or many times however uh the client at home on the person who's either building or remodeling in those larger jobs will uh will find they just need a little extra support mhm beyond what they're being given by the rising from\nAnd said they mostly I Would say eighty percent of the time bring me in themselves\nUh-huh so so how did this start it would seem like a you must have known that you had some special talent for seeing color that cetera\nNo actually it it was probably born out of wishing I had more talent\nI grew up uh you know one of those costs the kids you know always into things and so\nUh you know I was familiar with art and and ... and you know it was always involved in those kinds of things involved in color but actually a mining came out of my own renovation I was working on a a whole house remodel\nBack in two thousand five and a new color was important and it was kind of almost a good enough that it didn't know how important\nWas button not quite good enough to get it exactly the way I wanted and on my own I needed to close that gap\nSo the colors that you were considering we're just not making it somehow\nUm yeah there were [noise] you know you there's theoretical color and then there's actual color you can have a great idea and then the ... the step between taking that idea and\nConverting into something that ends up on all four walls is much different process has probably most of your listeners yeah no I mean there are so few people I run into who don't have a story about a pair of color going\nWrong with a pinch or might be gorgeous exactly you know hundred square feet of it\nIt gets big changes and so you know here's an example I put in bamboo floors in the house in Florida in two thousand five bamboo it was very popular at the time it seemed like a neutral to me but guess what my bamboo goes down\nIt's yellow suddenly you have a huge amount of yellow and you're ... so it was probably one of my first color lessons was your you know would is not a neutral you know we think of it that way but it really is and\nI bought a green couch I was so sure it was green I mean it was like light to green yeah and we got him and my wife was like a ... as long as it's not the right age ... put it in the house it's a huge and and I told you about that and you said is it in front of a blue is purple Waller ...\nRight right well I mean there's there's a couple of things going on there one is that we all perceive color differently you know we're all somewhere on a continuum and everybody's physiology is is different\nAnd the way it registers in our brain is different and the way we talk about it as is even different but really what was happening there was you know colors about relationships I Will say color is what it is because of what's around it and so we can use that to our advantage we can manipulate color is\nA and colors can kind of check to us because of that\nSo you you you got into this because of your own need to be better at finding color and then what was your training to actually become a color expert\nSo as as a homeowner who was remodeling um I just did a deep dive into researching color I read everything I could get my hands on I was in the Internet you know a\n... on chat boards you know talking about design and color and then through all of that I discovered the international association of color consultants mhm and\nI flew to San Diego for a little less than a week to do my first round of color training I've actually been out there for separate times for force separate models of that\nSo I Am on your Facebook friend and I see but you travel a lot and I see that when you travel you also seem to notice the you know vivid colors of Cuba or Morocco and things like that like how does that informed your work\nWell it it I Will say my work informs my travel choice uh-huh for sure [laughter] go through the country yeah just are just you know I mean I'm drawn to these famous I'll be vacationing in um well instead carousel or next year and that's also one of those you know top ten most colorful cities so\nI definitely feel a poll and\nI think that one of the things that helps me a and design is you know keeping things fresh and taking in as much visual data as possible I mean I'm doing it everywhere whether I'm walking around in North Hampton seeing what's in the windows\nOr you know I'm off to New York tomorrow and you know clearly I'll be I'll be watching and looking and and feeling and noticing my on response and I I think it all goes in you know in a deep way\nAh and then you know gets a brought back out on its needed right so I call it feeding the high uh-huh I like to keep my eye well fed\nYeah OK imagining you I mean if you're a dentist you walk around looking at people's teeth and\nRight All right yeah you must just notice everybody's color everything so hard\nIt's it can be painful actually you know there's you know you ever watch watch more TV just for a little road [laughter] no but that's probably a good idea\nNow mostly it's um you know my roots around town no driving here and there there's places I drive frequently you know there is there a couple of they're they're my favorite ice or some actually things that just makes me cringe every time I see them\nAnd I can't really an see that stuff you know and and likewise there are there places I find beautiful and I find that colors inspiring and and and that informs my work I'm working for a builder and Newberry port\nNow is doing a lot of houses and doing all of his color inside now and uh I chose a color based on something that inspired me on them straight mhm uh here in North Hampton house have been driving by for years and a sort of ... a little riff on not for this house and Newberry port some it all goes and ...\nSo how much do you serve the customers taste versus you'll be happy if you trust my expertise\nHundred percent customer taste in my job I'm a coach I'm I'm I Know that we're a little over used that I'm I there are decorators and designers who when you hire them you're buying their look you're hiring them because you love the look that they create\nAnd I see my role really as more of a facilitator I Will exert my own opinion uh when I think my clients making a decision that's not the for the best uh for the overall look up the project and I will always have a reason why\nI never say just just now you know I I work hard to be able to articulate why I support is an idea or why I I think we should keep looking ... um so yeah I my job is to really\nUnravel a client's relationship to design in their place and and and help them manifest what it is and they really want mhm\n[noise] so does it ever happened that you paint a certain color and then the client hates it or you hate it and then there's just a matter of time to let it kind of just ...\nI usually tell people to give it three or four days I think any time you have a big change particularly people who've gone from you know rental unit white to something a little with a little more verve\nIt can be a little shocking so I like to give people a you know I I say just just let it sit right ah I find it happens less and less longer I've been doing this work but yeah absolutely things go wrong it's often\nDue to miscommunication mhm I think if a client is hesitant to give me full feedback and they kind of think to themselves oh I I you know trust or you know and they don't really want to talk about it right that's when things can sometimes\nGo wrong and for some people I imagine if you have a party and everybody comes on loves that you're going to start to love it all to\nYeah you start to see the beauty of things through\nSays and then there's the nature of color like we just my kids are out of the house and we're considering turning him to be a B. and B. or whatever and so I just let my wife I said if you if you're if I have your final choice will tell you but\nSome of my daughter's room is now this very bold red which after she painted it well the painter told me\nRead ... kind of streaks black a little bit so when he put it on me so this is going to need a second coat 'cause you could see where there was just some you're looking at me like you don't want them cover yeah it\nDoesn't cover uh-huh and so if there's a different color underneath it will often show through depending on the kind of paint you use and what the paint chemistry as\nI mean ... while he Irish what just washed berries\nTen or Fifteen Years ago before there was a big evolution and paint chemist and prior to that painting a wall red would sometimes take five codes mhm around so\nI mean yeah but then again in the end or I look at it and I'm saying well that's pretty good and then my wife works out and says oh my God how did they forget that my childhood bedroom was this horrible roads is not far from\nThe front row yeah people have those childhood triggers for sure\nYeah so you're so how do you go about getting business\nWell ah I I'm On social media and um I don't advertise at all anywhere at this point it's largely word of mouth I'm when I first moved to the valley ten years ago\nI put in just a ton of leg work you know in terms of face to face in person networking or\nSomebody said how did you get successful I said you've got to be in the right place at the right time and I was everywhere so I was you know doing luncheon learns and chamber of events and I and I was just everywhere and then about four years ago I\nRealized I had kind of gotten enough traction and I I I'm ... to admit this on a business show but I went full stop on networking I just I just was ... and so now he\nCould as most people either have to the door are terrible at it so\nI'm good at it I enjoyed it and uh but it's exhausting and said it ... it is a part time job in a way\nSo I did that work and um you know I keep a very steady presence on social media and I don't do a lot of pushing of services um like just like to keep the word out and keep the conversation without color going I have a ton of repeat business I get a lot of referrals\nUm I'm On a site or online dedicated to designers called house a personal use easy you can find me down house and see some of my projects and read some reviews that's been a big driver I'm somehow I have\nI seem to have good STO people say they find me on Google I don't know how it's one of those mysteries of the international modern a competition\nThat would be some confusing\nI don't know if people call me from you know her again huh and I say how did you find me I Googled uh-huh when you work remotely like that I Do yeah I Do work all over the country I had I had my first international council\nSo you'd have to try to weigh it shows up on your screen as if it works like the same as their screen\nYeah there's a there's a way we sort of establish a baseline of color um I can either look at a photograph and they can tell me what the current color on the wall is ... and so I can kind of extrapolate from there and because everything will largely track together\nRight so there are ways we can work around here\nSo I'm surprised to hear you say a word of mouth I mean I'm not surprised because I Know you when it's ten people have told me about you since I've known you yeah oh that's not what I'm saying why would you recommend that you know that I'm looking for a color restore not right\nBut I've heard from people like in kitchen and bass that people don't recommend because they don't want to give away the secret of who fix their house so it's interesting to hear that you know some of the ... and other work\nThat's that's weird that's really interesting I don't know about that [noise] you know one of my very first clients here when I moved here swarm me to secrecy I think there may be a certain element of Yankee D I why that we can\nDo it ourselves here in New England you know and we don't need to hire decorators anyone on high alert decorators redness gracious\nSo um he's for me to secrecy is also become one of my great champion has has referred an awful lot of business to me since then but um so there may be some of that their inhibits people obviously that's not going to work with kitchen and back 'cause nobody is expected to do I why their kids\nAnd so this might be my last question okay the children's clothing store and I had one woman that came in she was a color separate or for her job so she really needs individual hunting industry yeah\nAnd so she'd say I need black pants for my son and I had numerous black pants she'd say those are two yellow those are two green those were to read in all these black pants\nJust some people just see color so well in your career that you need to deal with them differently than the average\nAbsolutely I mean again you know I talked about that continuum and at one\nThose who are colorblind and at the other end of the continuing we as Patrick ... to see more than ... than anybody else you know there are certain right animals in insects that also seem more colors well there's there's ... like that too\nSo I think there's two things going on one ... these are where people have trouble right ... yeah exactly they see a number and it's All right let's you know Wednesday's always blew\nBut I should mention that this is actually an interesting story because it's not a single star like our sun\nBut in fact it has by two stars binary stars orbiting this one meaning to say it's a triple star system\nOh so it's not even going to be like to wean where there's a double sunset business triple sunset right except that these two stars\nWould be quite far away that both at each other or with each other and about two hundred and fifty years the binary stars orbit the main star in eight thousand years so they would be quite far it wouldn't be like Ted to wean this beautiful some tax but it would be so like you know a a slight be far away dot moving\nBut this is a real planet that could sustain life from what we can observe from it using real astronomy right now or\nMaybe it's a little bit bigger than the IRT masses about eight times the or at least what astronomers call on this is the super but we don't know oh what is its density because we don't know its size yet\nI'm going to say that it could be gaseous\nOr it could be rocky as far as we know right now is we fought in order to have a life like ours we need a rocky planet is right at the edge off a the habitable zone habitable zone is that the place where water can exist in liquid form so that is good news to a certain degree\nBut the way I Would put it is if that is one planet then maybe more planets this planet itself may not be woken\nBut Republican may be lurking around somewhere\nI think because it's so big and so dance it really stifles the emotions of the people like that live there Oh yes one of your emotions makes their ears slightly pointy so I think that that it all seems to make sense from an astronaut died but from the gravity\nYeah except for the party that was a towards this guy but the other however I did it one of the component that you get an extent that it said was Spock was supposed to be strong rice and in that sense like\nYou know yeah you know higher gravity of the world but also I Would have been much shorter\nThere's been a death in the opposite house as lately is today I Know it by the numbers look

four minutes how many people in total see it on and I just over fifty people nice because it's already also down\nBut last week so sorry [laughter] but this is the first time you've done it now is actually the third time I've done it so we are sort of backed by popular demand\nWhich is going to cause I've given us a shot at evolving the shows\nAnd you're using the real buildings were taken to

exciting way the tension was there for the humor was fabulous great classic you're on your on how old am I doing [laughter]\nOkay someone tell us about life in the for once read the Sunday the Academy of music what is it for those who don't know and haven't been there and for those of us who have many times I Can't wait to see it again so that was our\nLife in the fall when three this is this the sixth time we have presented life and the four when three here\nUh in North Hampton and it's been an event that I think has been quite popular because it's a it's a ah\nIt's kind of a ... it's a celebration of like local ... it's a celebration of people here in the in the region with a\nFive radio new radio plays that are done his old time radio theater and uh with fully sound effects and musical gas and uh it's just a great fun or a celebration of that for one three area code\nWant to tell us who's the play rights are and who the actors are\nWell two of them are sitting right here Jonathan cause outlet and Ellen wit linger and uh they can talk a little bit about or their place but we also have Stephanie Carlson a we have a play from John gr silly a Jared Hansen a prank errands and\nUh and they were all about some aspect of life here in the four one theory\nPretty much the charge sometimes we give a very a specific kind of like scene I think last year was the new normal\nAh and ah this year it's the the theme is just more of a kind of a whole aspect theme to it but uh we didn't really give too many parameters to the play rights but they are all various aspects including a kind of quasi historical\nAh you know from grits silly about a a sort of a town meeting that took place a hundreds of years ago\nOkay so let's turn from Sam rush the producer one of the two producers to Ellen would linger who has one of the place in life in the Fort won three give us a review\n[noise] wow and I should interrupt an aunt is this the debut is this the premier of this plan\nFor taking a flight yes yes as I wrote it about a week ago [laughter] case [laughter] any of the play\nOut all of them are not typically for VS ... asked ravioli yes\nOkay your place so that mine is actually about to ask professors I don't stipulate which college as they might be from that we might gas [noise] um [noise] who meet at a farmer's market one Saturday morning\nSo we have a lot of sound effects for that and um basically they they're very I'm happy that they're\nSemesters are winding down its early spring and they're really looking forward to having stun with\n'em and one of the professors for her for the students' final projects for one of their classes she has allowed them to um come up with their own project rather than writing a paper and sell their project is that they are on a hunger strike and they're all march they come marching through the farmers' market as these two women are standing there\nOn a hunger strike aha [laughter]\nAny might this farmer's market looked familiar in some ways it\nMight ah you had ever been to a farmer's market here yeah\nMy I ha I'm going to focus on that word here but before we get too hung up on that let me turn to Jonathan cause all would play right actor numerous from North Hampton so your play life in the four one three is about what\nWell one of the great things about this region is we have a lot of then use that people can use for the various events various groups and organizations can bring their their thing to do this then you were that venue\nAnd now I'm not saying that this would ever happen in our region or that this has ever happened in our region but imagine what if there were a scheduling mix up as\nFar as who's using you mean someone doesn't come to the radio talk show at the time we were expected to that [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] and uh\nSo so yes you suppose there was a little bit of confusion as to who's using a particular venue at a particular time and particularly what would be the Foley soundscape of such a situation\nWhere we find out what would be the Foley landscape for such a situation any thoughts\nWell I haven't read this play I Know that there is a prank and I are going to be very busy Frank ... who's my other co Foley artists there's a lot of overlap there's a lot of\nOh I see you've got different sounds going on at the same time yes apps discordant in some well and some of the play rights now I think people now know that that part of the fun is the sound and\nSo I'm reading some of these thinking they are trying to challenge the Foley artist [laughter] the how many they can put in to one you know the the the ping pong table with the the D. J. rap and uh you know the ... you know it's all happening at the same time\nAnd quick detour sand rush Foley artist is what\nWell if only artist or provides the live kind of sound effects you know in film it's all of that you know when there's that fight these the artists that are actually slamming sides of beef or breaking cucumbers are salary to sound like crunching bones or you know that kind of thing but\nI Believe and I don't know really know but maybe want to be like is it that there was an individual whose name was fully thanks so but I'm not a hundred percent sure I think it was that was it's based on that one of the first guys who did sort of sound effects on Jack Foley Jack Foley uh yes so there we go\nAll time radio person I take it we know that Monti why would I get your fill maybe no ... radio Jack Foley April\nTwelve Eighteen Ninety One to November night Nineteen sixty seven to develop or many sound effect techniques using filmmaking\nAh okay yeah good research thank you so let me tell you the Internet so let me let me turn back\nTo the play rice journals and cause a within Ellen what lingered who are your actors in all this and where\nDid they come from and it's just I haven't met the actress who in my play were made on Saturday the first time and now that we're in through it and see who they are but I'm interested to meet some new local actors\nAnd Jonathan cause eh with same for you um I Know some of the people involved and I don't want to get any names wrong okay but I'm I'm really looking forward to it because I you know I've seen these people before and they're great and I can just already imagine what what\nThe job they will do with\nMy script let me turn back to a sandwich for a moment if I might see in terms of the players you signed a theme or made a request to the play rights and then they simply not simply but then they wrote for this production is that how it works\nOr works it's that way I Would say mostly like fourth fifth of that is correct a couple of the U.S pretty good for me it's a solid B a uh like L and the case of Allen I invited her to write something for this and uh she felt a little bit of a you know like twisted her arm just a little bit and she actually produced a beautiful\nUh a thing Jonathan I think your play you a was one that you had\nWritten for maybe a previous year that we didn't select and so we decided to do it for this year Stephanie was uh was one that I think was a similar situation that she wrote when we were soliciting for when three\nAre we should we relied on board and was there saw the need for this thing at and became a fundraiser for the green speak as a son with me\nWe should point out that the Greensboro justice fund was founded by Marty nice and using proceeds from the court case the civil court case\nThat resulted from the assassination of her her then husband by the Ku Klux Klan complicit with law enforcement so I'd like to turn a bit if I might to the celebration the service on Sunday itself again first churches this Sunday three\nO'clock three o'clock okay what was the service be it will be friends\nWho will get up and speak for very briefly about what ark he meant to us because I was walking down the street era today realizing that in\nThe ... what I find to be very dark times I really wish I had are key next to me [laughter] she had an unstoppable spirit\nOn optimism and joy and being with people that really pick you up when you were around ... am I right now\nYou are right you are re she\nShe's a was a person of incredible energy and ah and courage I think and and that she transmitted to others and ah I think gathered us all in and made us think that we could keep going and not just could but we really not going\nI take that as a service there'll be some talks the music and some are uplifting as well oh Martin isn't\nAll of those things and they're also will be food if you bring it\n[laughter] and that's why we are having a\nPot like mum [laughter] so if you could bring some finger foods are our deserts please Jill I'm everybody is invited even if you didn't know I Can't because if you didn't know let's talk about her because she's help us carry through these terrible Trump time\nAnd this was a celebration of community which is exactly what ... would have wanted in would have appreciated\nI'd like to turn to the river and the rabbi for moments and sisters are reveling in the rabbi segment\nAnd so you're very briefly the story that I heard just a few weekends ago\nThere was a lay minister type a mood presiding over a funeral a funeral over a wedding and he was talking to a member of the clergy\nAnd members asking for some pointers because they've never done a wedding before and the members of course he said look here's the real story at weddings nobody really cares about who you are or what you say or what you're doing you're just kind of there is a function or\nIs it funerals where people were\nReally appreciate me so actually I like to knows better than weddings which terrible but I think it does but has but has has some\nTruth to it I think so I appreciate your perspective ... drugs I think there's truth to it they'll see markets there's truth or I\nWasn't sure [laughter] like funerals are wedding [laughter] I may not mix\nWeddings are often about the clothes that people are wearing and\nAnd just I'm a having a really good time and the meal afterwards and I I think funerals are the most moving events that I go to a here in the city because that is when people really pay tribute to the lives of\nLike are key Markham and are and where they do just what you are doing Mary ah and it's it's so moving and we had one for Archie up at the um the matrix community where we all came forward and talked about are you\nAnd and talking about are you there was so powerful bill I I I I agree there's something about the funerals where people talk about the lives of people in such a meaningful way and talk about\nThe lives of people who have passed away in the ways in which they have this back to those who continue to live and that is so moving and I think so revealing and I think is absolutely true for ... because she affected\nThousands of people in very meaningful very personal ways\nLet me turn to rabbi Justin David your thoughts yeah well first of all bill I think you should make an appointment with your spiritual advisor [laughter]\nSorry priority [laughter]\nIraq [laughter] having said that I actually I have a different\nKind of question for you after the show [laughter] and I'm\n... this is a question for Peter but for everyone um but I but I Want to start with Peter because um when I think of someone like archaea and someone who is a role model for some of these people and ... around whom so many people cluster\nI'm from your perspective as a pastor I'm Peter and and someone who led who who led communities and still leads religious communities what does it mean to have\nSome Archie or someone like ... in the community what does what does that do for the community and how I Am I'm curious to hear how that one person with\nExtraordinary abilities and generosity and commitment to really shape the dynamic of a whole group of people\nWell well Mary and and Marty just shut it for me to uh I I mean these are hard times where we all I mean what's happening in Washington right now what's happening to our country right now is really hard it's hard for me I I wake up in the night feeling just terrible about America this time\nAnd and so someone like Archie does ... it really she really lifts up and I to uh think of ... I I live next to argue when I came to first churches\nOr they had a ... right across the street from our house in Georgia showers and show she welcomed me to North Hampton and she made me she was she in our ... and George for the first people to make me feel like I was really part of this community and she does this every day when we think about\nMarriage Santa Marta nascent final word on the ... Mark I'm in the service and celebration of her life that will occur this Sunday at three o'clock at first churches here in North Hampton everyone has invited friends and those who simply want to know more about ...\nOr anyone who simply wants to join in this community celebration of an amazing woman\nPlease join us because I I think it will be uplifting um and I think you will feel energized and you'll learn about Iraqi if you don't already know and if you do you will celebrate her and it will be so helpful to you\nReturned from Arizona to MORNING EDITION doctrine isn't\nI think he tried to change the world I'm In a pretty selfless way um and I think that we all see that the world needs that change and and I think\nThat communities such as we will have together on Sunday will help a lot and making the changes we need\nAnd and we should note that uh the ... fund will gladly accept your contributions in honor of or the market\nWe certainly will and argue would love that\nWhen we come back we're going to continue with the river and in the rabbi and we'll be joined by north Hampton city council president Ryan O'Donnell right after this [noise]\nShortages cheese on the shores there's the issue [noise]\nInside each ice cold [noise]\nOne\n... shot Tuesday it's nice restaurant day this Tuesday night I Am ... day we'll be releasing gift certificates for the restaurant in Hampton need an authentic Italian American cuisine restaurant\nCredible Italian pizza pasta seafood in a low bar great for the family worked for a date and this Tuesday he said thirty percent ...

love the idea I'm not sure how practical it is or whether it's constitutional but Dr Henry Miller talked about it wrote about it\nAnd he's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute and frankly a great asset to the show in a great friend of the show Dr Miller welcome back on\nThank you Ira it's great to be with you\nSo what do you think about the idea of requiring that elected officials and I'd take it from Capitol Hill out to every state legislature and maybe every city council and county commission is this practical\nWell all of them to be clear I Am not suggesting that in the article that it'd be required I'm suggesting that politicians subject to its all entirely and that the vote if they don't or if they don't do it\nThe voters punish them at the ballot box that's a great free market approach to it isn't it\nI I think so so in the same way that we are like two or insist on on knowing whether open heart surgery was successful in a prominent politician or brain surgery and more to the point um we we could do it\nFor for just general or intelligence and mental status and psychopathology testing and so on but I think uh I think it has some merit\nTo ... do you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable\nThat they don't create false positives either a falsely tell us that somebody has a genius or false they tell us that somebody is a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right\nAnd nobody has to be afraid is going to produce a result there's going to paint them as a lunatic\nYeah there there actually are some good ones and uh you know some of it is clearly subjective so when a psychiatrist or tries to measure or evaluate your fund of knowledge and your incite\nA and your intelligence and your memory that's that's all pretty subjective but psychologist had come have come up over the years\nWith tests like the MPR the Minnesota multi phased ...\nPersonality and tore a that consists in its usual form of five hundred and sixty seven your questions and that comes up with\nPretty good measures of ten a clinical parameters are like ... type of dry SSN psycho pathology and belligerent and and so on as well as for a scales that are that\nTend to shed light on the validity of the of\nThe test so if you try to give them the answers you want normal answers normal people answers or it can detect it because it asks questions in several different ways and a kind of looks for inconsistencies so I think I think there are pretty good ways to do that when the ... the\nTests are performed by professionals\nI just I took that one time a couple of three decades ago 'cause I thought it'd be interesting I kept hearing about the MP I thought I'll take it is\nFull of some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the result but you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first\nAh and the ... the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh the degenerative disease\nOr at the wasting away the frontal and temporal lobes and he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on but it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress are centered or did they ah they really don't have any business doing the job anymore\nYeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and a arguably he really should have resigned a retired when ... ... the severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with the cats and on\nConfirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote a that's a practical example of stability patients uh that really arguably should have dictated a resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town and that sort of thing\nI suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house in signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know ... over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense if say you know that there's a senator from Montana\nOr deans who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot\nShould we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district to their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists in Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and uh there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person loading and you could do it in a book by something like Skype so that you see\nA a counter could actually see that the person was cast as well as ...\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you were Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently a ... among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check\nAnd I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well they have a device attached\nYou have to actually look at the camera and be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube\nShowing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple tests you know per week to assure that you've not gone back to the bottle and I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator to barter smartphone\nA show his retinas to the camera phone my ... my phone will do that it'll confirmed who you are by ... it'll confirmed move your by fingerprint\nYou could do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast the vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with a with a great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not she doesn't seem to be affected all the time\nBut there have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can't find a word and uh\nIs what I Would consider way outside the thousands\nOf normal or the ability to express herself so um we're we're gonna have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she used opposed as a majority leader as a leader of the Thames in the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nAnd and most of the content yeah I\nI don't wish or ill but if somebody is not fully capable in politics no one wants to be removed from the spot no one is likely to want to remove themselves their own party isn't likely to want to remove them\nAnd the other party catches all kinds of health if they say well we'll take the person out because they're too crazy\nOn you're going to drag out a bunch of lunatics they'll bring out and Julie sweating again and ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind working evil they do mind looking implausible\nBy the way you should do that in colder results from the attorney in a very climbing a law degree is in court for important people are just she's traumas and all let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal reporter I imagine that says that Leland Kaiser the longtime friend of\nOf a Christian Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI the Jews leaned on to treat her story from I wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it\nYou apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be I think if if it's possible more than one eighty\nOr from I don't know anything to I remember the incident use is not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to inform somebody to lie to the FBI and hence to Congress in a process like this where it's not just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nOh I think I I haven't looked up is the federal budget on that but it is certainly a crime to\nUh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to to perjury well it was under a a a signed on assigned oath statement yeah absolutely as a crime if it was just in talking to Senate Democrats\nThan not saying it under oath um possibly could day I'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents but yeah it absolutely\nThey should and they got the prosecutor I Am so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things have gotten out of the trunk he's showing it showing Republicans how fun it is to attack back for once but Republicans always want to be the gun sports that oh okay we want in the end we got we got cabin\nOn the court no no no no a statement has to be made this will never happen again you will not for me or something like this and will destroy his life like that\nI couldn't agree more now now what should we you should go try it out somebody else but let's say that a ruby introduced Berg leaves the court in the next two years before the end of this term and I anticipate a second term because of everything good that's going on ... ... what can we do proactively\nTo stream the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to remember said don't try this again because private cute prosecute\nProsecute prosecute I Want to know who leaked the letter that was given in confidence to two on the Senate that will Feinstein thing where they have to get to the bottom of that they know the name of the guy who\nIn a home addresses unfolding numbers of public it was senator it on the local law or the lesser known as doc thing on AOL and we do have so perjury charges including for I Know they loved him a judge Kavanaugh was largely personally he\nCan he say he rank excessively no I I I think he kind of didn't say that I Know he more they'll show does he\nI mean it's either ... or ... that's what they are claiming is is perjury while\nChristine lazy afford not to be confused with Dr for number one she's not a medical doctor number two she's not even a psychologist she lied about four things uh she lied about the fear of flying yup she lied about the polygraph test she lied about needing a fun age to a second son door\nI'm actually lied about being a psychologist statements under ...\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's here's my rule for that and now I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical you know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury and in many cases they don't go after\nIt because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential boost could have literally changed American history for the next phase jak cage so with such a consequential result\nLying under oath in this case should absolutely be be prosecuted to the phones degrees along\nYeah also we have to send a shot across the Democrat bell um because they are just go to a country of three hundred and

as far as the campaigns concern even just having the technology to be able to id voters I heard some great stories about the campaigns back in the seventies where the family was just sent out to knock on every door and now we can kind of have a better idea of who's\nVoting and who's not and that kinda thing over forty years have passed since he was first elected our our political views may differ a little bit too just like a campaign strategy to defer a little bit but it's a huge inspiration and motivation for me\nAnd went around to carry out the airbase will replace the retiring state Matt John side back ... championing this this\nIs the Lars Larson show\nOne of those ...\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell the first amendment friday Lars Larson\nWhich the driver's seat you talk about what you want to

the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to take your phone calls and your emails that eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com era so\nMuch going on tonight you've got Lisa Murkowski the only Republican who plans to vote no tomorrow on judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and she's been on the Senate floor trying to um I don't know trying to explain to vote and so far the explanation is not working very well for me\nBecause I see what she's saying and or\n... years away I added up she just finished saying that judge ... Brett Kavanaugh is a good man\nNow if you believe the sexual assault charges against him if you believe that he dropped his pants and presented his private to Debbie Ramirez at Yale University if you believe that he participated in high school age gang rape parties fueled by alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs\nIf you believe all that he is not a good man so Murkowski believes he's a good man okay then what's wrong with him she also says he's a fine judge okay she sees a fine judge so if he's a good man and a fine judge then what's the problem she says well he's just not the right man for the job\nWell you look at his history you look at is legal resume you look at his history of decisions and all\nThis makes no sense what she's saying but she's got to try to explain that somehow as far as I'm concerned I Hope the people of Alaska understand they could have had Joe Miller instead of Lisa Murkowski so as far as I'm concerned are really committed election fraud when she won\nBecause Joe Miller a was the man who was cheated out of the nomination et cetera and we're going back over some old history but frankly I think the Murkowski was not the right person to represent the state of Alaska and now she's showing it\nBecause she says she's going to vote no tomorrow on a judge who is qualified she calls him a fine judge he's a good man\nShe says which means he's not a sexual criminal or a gang rape is somebody who would drug his fellow high school classmates or to be able to obtain sexual favors\nIf all those things are true and Murkowski saying all those things then what exactly does she come up with as the excuse for voting no\nAnyway it's a First Amendment friday I'm Glad to have you with me and if you want to join the best conversation and talk journalism is right here at eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com\nDollars in Asia and be using like it's easier than ever now you can use the ... instead of chat where your food\nPurchases [noise] we get the free nutrition program that helps working families fetch there\nBy it and make healthy choices wick help families learn to shop for nutrition ... and ... or things like online Christian education and then make shopping easier ... minute on line ... ... not a nice way to find out if you qualify\nAs messengers rocky by the Massachusetts department of public health nutrition program\n[noise] if you are at least sixteen years old and we plan to take a\nHigh school equivalency exam or why do improve your reading writing and math skills illiteracy project is the way for you to find out about our free classes in North Hampton cameras Greenfield orange and wear check us out on line that W.

wash them shows will come back from Lars Larson show\nIt's a pleasure to be with you on a First Amendment friday and I'm Glad to get your phone calls and emails in a bed at eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nMy next guest is a martial arts expert Navy SEAL and pedophiles worst nightmare courage Scheuer joins me to talk about how he's battling the growing problem of child sex rings in America\nGreg good to have you on a thank you so much for your service for America\nWell it was a pleasure to appreciate you having me on last night it was it's always my pleasure that the Airbus oh tell me about a veterans for child rescue\n[noise] well it's a nonprofit organization that I founded a west my my daughter especially my daughter last year in March of two thousand so that she was abducted at that point and brutally sexually assaulted for hours to sort of ...\nAnd ... a month later in April we officially found at veterans for child risk you try to make sure that that didn't happen to to others\nAnd I I was learning already\nThat there was a there was a widespread problem with child trafficking in the United states in ... ah that I've got a lot of contacts and colleagues that that could really helped me be instrumental in fighting this problem but rather than ...\nAddressed that as a kinetic problem like law enforcement might I thought uh I could be a better health\nAlerting the populace to it and the best tool to do that to shake the American people awake and and and\nLet everybody know hey this is what's happening to our kids are as a documentary\nSo we began filming a documentary and uh we've got Eighteen months of filming now coast to coast or Southeast Asia down on the U.S border and we've been running sting operations with federal and local law enforcement interviewing different witnesses and surviving victims and family and uh\nAll aspects of the state of crisis really to just try to empower the American people with the knowledge of what's happening to the kids with child trafficking because it is\nEstimated that at one hundred and fifty billion dollar industry there's an estimated ... million children being bought and sold as merchandise right now on the sex trade as that something that's not okay with me so that's what's that's for ... rescue this\nIt's an alert piece to to alert the American populace to empower us against it so that culturally\nWe can put that the bad and a stand up against it\nTogether Greg does a horrific inspiration for what happened I have to ask how is your daughter doing\nWell she's tough she's she's a fighter it was a horrifically um impactful against her obviously she had just turned Eighteen at the time and uh I'll I'll share one little snippet\nI'm yeah I'm not as easy to go beyond you know I mean I I don't want to dig too much but I mean we want to know how your daughter's doing so\nYeah but on the positive uh she has served as a junior ... age it with us on a on a very large and powerful joint sting operation and she's been instrumental in helping put away several pedophiles child predators and she has stood there and watch them get and cost and put away\nSo that was very empowering for her and she said you know pop up that was more healing than any amount of counseling or anything else could have ever been so she's a fighter she's going to be okay and I think she's going to be an inspiration there to help to others you know ... and just kind of how she is wired\nI think that somebody we ought to find a way I have some acquaintances and co workers who've who've been sexually assaulted\nAnd everyone reacts differently I Know women who don't ever want it mentioned again I Know women who will tell you exactly what happened you know because they believe that I think it helps give them some ... and so\nPeople should not assume that when when someone has been the victim of a sexual assault that they that everyone reacts and saying that they they don't want to talk about it in some cases they do a and and being\nYou know hearing the story and all that helps them out as you said it did for for your daughter many women and girls might not have had the strength to do with your daughter did to to live through that to recover from it and then to go out and help catch the bad guys uh that's that's an incredible shows strength and and I can't say enough good things about a young lady willing to do that\nWell you're right but we do all relapse react to things differently and sometimes it's a timing issue sometimes ah somebody may hibernate a bet with the with the pain and want to be quiet about it and then later in life there like you know what I'm not okay be pilot or house by the time to speak out so\nUh whenever whenever\nI I support anybody's mess of dealing with it I mean I wouldn't want I wouldn't wish on anybody and I think that's why I'm so passionate about fighting it and just and turning our culture against it you know back in the Nineteen fifties there's a man named Alfred Kennedy that falsified about your sexual studies to make it sound like a\nPedophilia and child rape was somehow okay and he softened our laws to it a softened are psychological system and soft on our educational system\nTo pedophilia as fast forward three generations later we've got an epidemic of child rape and I don't want that to happen to anybody so I think what we've got to do now is turning the culture back against that which has proven to be so harmful to children whose minds are not yet fully developed they cannot advocate\nFor themselves against a fully grown creditor and we've got to defend the defenseless we've got to rally around our children\nAnd and defend against a these these harmful adult predators\nI'm Talking to ... a former special operators sniper for Navy SEAL team one and a founder of veterans for child rescue [noise]\nWhat do you hope to show in the documentary to to bring attention to some part of this from were not aware of because we know there was a child sex trafficking or you know practice in this country and we'd like to shut it down and it seems amazing that a country like this has had such a tough time getting a handle on is\nWell it's a global problem and and for some reason it seems like it's being suppressed in the mainstream news media they won't tell us what's going on with it it it is the fastest growing criminal enterprise on earth so why are we the citizens in old\nVery deliberately and very specific like what's going on so to answer your question what I what I intend to share with the American people is that which they need to know\nTo fight this epidemic that's happening to our children that they're not otherwise be tall literally just lock the American people through the truth whatever that may be to show that different aspects of what is really going on with the kids so that we the citizens can understand the nature of the threat\nAnd and effectively defend our children accordingly\nYou know Craig I I don't know whether you agree with is on the line to get your take on it I see an awful lot of so called homeless people on the street now some of them are there for mental problems over there for drug problems but I get the feeling that\nWhen a young man or woman or a young child who's under Eighteen says I'm leaving my parents' house sometimes are leaving because of bad things that have happened sometimes are leaving\n'cause they don't like mom and dad's rules and when they started living on the streets it seems like that is the prime opportunity for these traffickers\nTo get a hold of them and and uh and get a hold on them and and and start to prostitute done and that that seems like something we could take care of if we stop making the assumption that if you don't want to live with mom and dad\nAre ... ... you know then you can go out and live on the streets and a lot of cities like it or not aid and abet people and living on the streets and they get in the way of returning those children even to their original household more\nTo foster family but not tolerate them simply living in probably the most vulnerable spot they can live in on the streets without adults around\nVery astute observation you're absolutely right there are predators waiting\nSo the boys and girls if you think that that your son or daughter can go one way or the middle of like go to a bus or or or place to catch a cab or homeless people hang out and not as part of this lady for them to offer them a place to stay yup a\nAnd if we have a sensible immigration policy we should be able to see wages go up to me\n[noise] yeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three big groups I think if people that we that we should think about one that people with a criminal record you know employers have often been worried to hire those areas you know tens of millions of of of Americans with federal records has a\nBunch of those I think have struggled to find work those are slowly I think\nBeing brought it back into the labor force than there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time that still over a million people people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those folks can now find jobs\nAnd then there's the last group but I think that's the debate where where the social that that kind of play more that the people having to look into if it out of the labor force or\nFor a for quite a while or that good it was about a million people you know we can bring all those people back in that I think the labor situation really is better than\nIt's been in the last fifty years ah you know I think right now the late nineties still look pretty good you know that it had higher labor force is station that not only the unemployment rate low but basically everyone was trying to find work\nWe can get back to that then I'll be fully says\nYeah we'll stand the limited throwing idea ... I was down in Dallas texas couple of years ago to two new broadcast one of our stations\nAnd I saw a company that was advertising its services construction company but I think they called themselves con structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the banner they had on the side of a building it made it clear they would hire ex cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've uh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show who said I have a ... a felony record\nAnd I tell all my employers when I first go to work for him or when I first interview I have this record on beyond it I've I've I've corrupted my behavior\nAnd I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have\nGovernment's trying to ban you know even asking about criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're gonna go straight and you're gonna straighten out your behavior then we're we're happy to have you tell us that so as an employer you can take advantage of the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker\nHe wants to get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want a private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company and I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put them to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage\nBecause then you've got access to a a whole crowd of people who may not be be accessed right now by conventional employers who just screen you out of the beginning\nDoes that make sense\nNow than they settled sense if we we've started to see a little bit of that so for example Wal Mart which of course is that you know the the largest employer\nOf them all like a million and a haven't believes in the U.S that they've started you know trying to target a or reject federal records a little more they're recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll all work out\nSo where can we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers fund that can't get anybody to work for them because they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nWell I I think first of all we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people once that happened I I think you start to the wage growth as long as you know of course the economy has to keep growing right so if we if we suddenly enter a recession we wouldn't see it that\nYou know given all the fiscal stimulus we've had from that from that tax cut from the\nYeah the increase in spending I think the next\nCouple of years we should we should really start to see some wage growth at least in the long run you know if wages only keep increasing it we you know we develop new technology that build new factories and better equipment and things like that so\nYou know ultimately that's where we're at a wage growth is that it's going to have to come from that data requires an innovation to continue with people wanting to invest and things like that\nWe got a break in Sacramento stand on that note you mentioned the tax cuts is not jazz income taxes it's instant expensing or rapid expensing of equipment so it used to be if you bought a a new big piece of equipment to expand your capabilities uh comedy new excavator anew bulldozer or a new machine at your factory\nYou had to take the tax savings on it over ten or Fifteen or Twenty years now you can take 'em right away so there's a tremendous incentive for\nUh but he's gotten expand

Peterson are involved in a few other folks as we will marched down main street and or or you know it's fun to be in a very you know I'm not big fans of parades generally I can and I I think this has to do\nWith some of the sour taste that have been put into mind miles over the years I remember this was a long time ago and I remember going to parades as a kid and I can remember elephants and everything I I don't I think the parade has something to do with the ... brothers Barnum Bailey when they would come to town and they would have a real old fashioned parade through the streets of Boston\nAnd so I kind of remember that a little bit I remember being on my dad's shoulders to parades things like that\nAnd then when I got older or younger so I had to date with this young woman who turned out to be a nut and I met her in a bar which is not something I Do normally do because I don't really do a lot of hanging out at bars and so you know I don't usually go hunt for women in bars\nOr about this uh this thing kind of happened in the next thing you know I got this date so what are we going to do in our little date well we're going to meet for the south Boston the parade this would be the um now I Can't remember what the occasion was a ... would be the holiday which means\nWhere everyone in South Boston which turned out to the parade ... Memorial Day I Can't remember which one it was but anyway\nUh there I Am in this parade and uh you know all the politicians are there everybody going by you know Ted Kennedy's waving at you and the mayor of Boston as waving at you and whatever\nOkay so I'm In the midst of all this there was a some kind of a slowdown now if you remember south Boston which has changed it pretty dramatically over the years but south Boston was the racist capital of the world\nAlong with Charleston which is even worse at the time uh I grew up with this kind of crap and ah what I witnessed mostly in my life was white on black violence\nI never ever eighty I'm In ... it definitely happened but I never actually when I was off the street life and I never witnessed or a black on white nose witness white on black was always white or picking on blacks\nAlways and this was like in through the Nineteen seventies everything else because we lived right in Dorchester andme arena I did in the Nineteen seventies so ah anyway um the parade slows down to some kind of a parade to do this you know you wonder how this happens with parade I dunno ... never made any sense to me but the label completely come to a halt right\nAnd it happened to come to a halt ... with all these drunks or course lions and I'm Talking about serious drunks lining the size of the parade route and there was a color guard and there were four members of the each branch of the armed services are represented the Marines in the army the navy the the air force so even the coast I think it was five of them\nAcross and they all have a big flag and there\nAre three of these five gentleman happened to be black\nI'm black people generally would not set foot in South Boston free or their very lives and in fact uh even if you're a white person who didn't come from South Boston you didn't set foot in southwest Charleston was way worse but anyway go south Boston was a pretty nasty\nNo these for at least for a gentleman a far down on a real standing there with their large very starkly okay and people are throwing ... helping them with beer cans and they remain store the whole time okay that was the last parade that I really\nWent to see very I I was in Disneyworld ones with the Disney already but that doesn't really count and so it turned me off a bridge for a long time really ... and of course you can't really\nGet in fights because you're going to end up with a gash across your forehead so is is just a weird weird time and that was ... thank God things have changed ... been in South Boston is not quite as in your face racist or that you as it once was but man\nI was writing former holding your real from the armed services right helping them with beer cans on the streets of softball comes to me anyway here's your

that in Monday you could get it on the cars that in a drunken abusers don't belong on the Supreme Court or compare\nIf you will be lying in the crime erupting Brett Kavanaugh did in his a quote unquote performance or with Hillary Clinton when she um testified against the hospital Republican committees and she did not cry or all labs that grace under pressure so little little play acting here\nThey acting on the part of Kavanaugh but uh I think it's just a insight into temperament as much as anything else\nUm when you go back uh I I think it was a little more than it was that when I don't remember exactly when it was but it was before the twenty sixteen election where the Republican controlled house committee investigating Benghazi called Hillary Clinton and\nAnd they questioned her for something like eleven hours and she was graceful intelligent informative\nUh nothing coming even close to anything that could be considered ally are just very dignified a very well informed and it just grace under pressure in every way and even a couple of years before that she had testified before another committed believe it was a Senate committee controlled by Republicans about Benghazi\nAnd she was fabulous through that entire ah one she only had one angry a moment where she said what difference does it make when the Republicans were harping on some very specific very trivial detail\nAh and then Republicans blew that all out of proportion and she had lost her mind and was screaming and yelling and they didn't care about Americans who had died so they took one tiny little phrase that in anger and turned that into she's not qualified she doesn't have the temperament and yet Kavanaugh's testimony\nThere were full hours and hours of testimony that were completely on hand there were so angry\nAnd so emotionally inappropriate for the situation that uh you know and yet they just say well he was wrongly accused of something of course is going to be angry with Hillary Clinton's been wrongly accused of things for decades [laughter] yes she's angry about them but yes she knows when she was testifying\nShe can't just stand there and yell and scream and flipper pages back and forth\nYou know Matt Damon didn't do an imitation of Hillary going on Saturday Night live after her hearings\nYou could almost see the Republican committee turning their pages to the script and you know we're supposed to cry on cue okay and and ... on this one little a passage you are from John charge calling her\nAre and you can be magical but sometimes it's just plain nasty for example we have a president accused of sexual assault selecting a Supreme Court nominee who's also accused of sexual assault and into deeper already Kavanaugh might joined Clarence Thomas accused of sexual harassment decades ago as the deciding vote you criminalize women's reproductive choices in this case I already sucks irony sucks\nIn this case I mean there there's so many things about this really suck ... uh the fact that uh you know ... ... after a forge testimony Trump was saying like she seemed really\nA dignified and credible and he said something like what a nice lady or something much of the late night little alien yeah and then just a few days later he was mocking her at one of his yeah one of his rallies or\nThe irony that anybody would believe Trump on any matters related to sexual harassment or sexual assault is it sucks it just there's no other way around it\nBut the another passenger from the the drunken abuses for my college dorm don't belong Supreme Court and neither does the cabin uh you know I'm I was in the eighth grade the eighth grade and there were several of my classmates\nWho were involved in in what they used to call a gang bang Mm behind at the school they had a campfire behind the school and everybody knew that this happened and they brag about it and laugh about it and all that and uh\nYeah it's it's pervasive in American culture that that men get away with things that are just at home\nAnd women do report these things they get crucified for it and I hope that the me too movement is leading a toward changing that\nUh I have I have a lot of optimism for the future not the immediate future [laughter] ah but the long term future a that this is going to change that men are not allowed to systematically abused women like them and get away with it\nDon't charge latest column is on Mondays jelly here you have your cars that you can find it on ... and I believe I'm going to see John ... at the end of the week on friday for pong the phone

and\nPeople may disagree with the decision or a series of decisions and sometimes the curtain has been drawn back just a bit as and Bush versus Gore\nWhich was about the Supreme Court electing a Republican president but the Supreme Court has so much residual good faith and faith in it as an institution from the people that by and large\nThe authority and the legitimacy of the Supreme Court was not significantly damaged I don't think this I think is different because what Kavanaugh's showed is that these are guys a guy in a black robe who's a political operative that is what he is\nAnd these are right winger and he's an ideologue and can you imagine being someone from the ... the Hillary Clinton camp being in front of judge Kavanaugh after he screamed his venomous diatribe at

things like getting a mortgage getting student loan but the truth of the matter is whether it's good or bad debts still needs to be paid for let me give you a simple a three step method\nI consider it to be good debt if first of all the items and assess city and secondly if it has a finite time that you're going to pay it off in and thirdly if it is easily affordable\nFor you know if you take any one of those elements away you can put it in the bad debt column let's use a car is an example now we could all say a cars and stuff that he because we have to be able to get to work it has a finite time that you're gonna pay for it it it might be a five year time line but if the payment is a stretch for you to afford I Would put it in a bad debt column\nI like to keep those three criteria in mind so that you can decide whether it's good or bad to thank you how can people contact you well thank you that can reach us up for one three seven seven four or five five five five or visit us on

today because well I Can't say it's breaking news because it broke a little while ago but there is a story as I understand it the third every woman who's just won the Nobel Prize in physics Don Strickland can you share the\nStory with us Dr phil they're absolutely um so yeah Nobel Prize has been around for well over a hundred years and in that time a grand total of three women have ever won the Nobel Prize in physics and ah\nI I can pretty safely say that's not because there have been no other women in that time who made significant enough country and the third is two thousand ... thousand Eighteen as of October second Donna Strickland\nJust became the third ever a Nobel physics laureate and the first one since Nineteen sixty three wow I'm so Marie Curie in Nineteen oh three\nA rare ... minor in Nineteen sixty three and now Donald Strickland in two thousand Eighteen and that's it\nDo you tell us a little bit about the two previous women winners of the Nobel ...\nMarie Curie is certainly you know one of the most famous women scientists ever she is the only person male or female to ever win the Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry ooh I'm and she did a lot of the early pioneering work on radioactivity\nI'm Alone with her husband Pierre Curie with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in physics\nUm and I have read that apparently the Nobel Committee was considering giving the prize to him um and that he among others objective that she had done just as much of the work as he did and uh they ended up sharing the prize the two of them and then\nAbout ten or Fifteen Years later she also got the Nobel Prize in chemistry\nI'm the second woman who won the Nobel to win the Nobel yeah go certain Meyer um got the prize in sixty three she uh came up with the basic model that ah we still use to describe atomic nuclei the nuclear showing model I'm\nWhen we make the structure of the Adam in our classes in school that's the is that her either not quite when you make the structure of the\nDot oh yeah and then you what you're making if the structure of the electrons around it now it was discovered by Neal's bore\nGo ... Meyer figured out that if you zoom in on the nucleus it has much the same structure of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus light and shells that look just like those models you were making a ha I'm but nobody understood how that works because the forces are completely different she figured out how to make that model work\nSo with in the Cold War\nExplain that a little bit yeah proton electrons neutrons on hanging out together in the core protons and neutrons are in the court the electrons are way\nWay outside so one of the standard images people\nDescribed as if the nucleus were the size of a basketball okay the electrons would be out at the outer edges of large cathedral um the nucleus is a miniscule die in the middle of the Adam and so people just thought of it is this you know sort of solid lump\nUm but they knew there were these things they couldn't explain about it you have certain numbers of protons and neutrons that would always be there and other numbers would never occur\nAnd no one knew why and go ... Meyer figured out it's because inside that tiny little dot they have these expanding shells just like the electrons in the outer part of the Adam\nWell let me turn now if I might to jury and Weinberger also a professor of physics at Smith College tell us what it is the dumbest Strickland what's her discovery with her contribution to physics that won her the Nobel Prize in physics this year the third woman\nEver it's been forty five years is really I have a fifty years over fifty years I had to do that on my head in my hand to try to I got it wrong time somehow no woman was deserving of the Nobel Prize in physics but\nAnyway I Newman if not deserving of the Nobel Prize in math\nOr or even arithmetic for that matter I okay so how was that\nWell strictly at the time this was back in the Nineteen eighties was actually a graduate student ... at the University of Rochester and together they worked on or develop the technique for I'm taking lasers which had been around for over about twenty five years at that point\nAnd figured out how to um make laser pulses extremely short and extremely powerful and so the upshot of that was it opened up an incredible area of all kinds of applications where they could investigate\nThings that happen as Gary was talking about inside Adams themselves on very very short timescales with these very short laser pulses and all kinds of applications where they could use these high power pulses to do things like eye surgery a machining of aircraft engine parts are literally putting holes and baby bottle nipples all kinds of stuff\nSo the reason that I have had laser eye surgery and I have our new Nobel laureate to thank for that I'm In part\nYes [laughter] yes\nTell us a little bit more about lasers you are expert on this as I understand it and I would like to know\nNot only about these applications but whether the new Star Wars movies now going to be even more than the White House and because the ... and all that a lot of a lot of what we see about lasers is or not the industrial applications where you are\nAmazing and knocked the laser eye surgery which you've heard about but they're also a laser pointers and such it's\nOK whatsoever I Know I I Know about [laughter] I like to think they like it [laughter]\nSo let's back up a little\nHere and what is a laser ... okay well\nLet's start with what isn't a laser and that's all the all ... all the kinds of light sources that we're more used to like the lights in this room at this moment the sun et cetera\nAnd citizens have have developed this this term\nUh describes such light sources as incoherent which kind of describes that they're all over the place so there for the most part composed of what we call white light so all different colors which are different wavelengths of light um they go in all different directions and they're not in any way acting in concert\nLast incoherent light the kinds of light that we're used to an everyday\nRight here in because they can't get themselves Oregon yeah they're great\nThey're ... they're kind of Zach representatives of the Trump Administration has said hey ladies [laughter] oh let's try to stay away from the politics [laughter]\nBut in any case lasers are hum as most people have seen for example laser pointers are very different so they're highly directional so all those the light that comes out of a laser pretty much goes all the the the waves go in the same direction\nUm and also it's very what we call highly Monica dramatic which means single color so most lasers um have a very very narrow range of wavelengths that constitute that late and since it's so highly um like a pencil beam it can be controlled very easily with lenses and mirrors and such and\nI'm On like uh the the ... kinds of white light that we used to\nSew the laser itself\nAs I understand what you're saying it's funneling white it's putting it through a very very small opening\nIs the nature of laser light itself is to be that to to emerge from the inside of the laser which um it has energy stored in it and then when that energy emerges it naturally comes out in a very very tiny beam\nAnd his Monica traumatic so into the light spectrum is reduced to a very small slice of it so I have a land so far recollection\nYes like white light goes from the the um you know blue end of the spectrum to the red end of the spectrum and his most lasers are single color essential\nAnd other usually read or are they going to be any they can be ... and they were ... lasers\nInfrared lasers all different colors of ... or any end of the ... yeah absolutely there's even X ray versions of laser\n... okay so this light is coming through this very ... pinpoint it's very concentrated is there some proportion mechanism to this is there like a hammer for gun that projects ...\nRoss do you like is this last\nSaturday morning at eleven one on one five one over Seventy five\nYou know when you get

loyalty program you know if you are somebody who you love chick fillet and you're going to go there you go to Starbucks 'cause you want that coffee what you're also doing is you're going there instead

finds that men are inflation adjusted\nAre earning less today than men did\nPlus years ago I think about that\nAnd the reason is the nature of work has changed so much men historically a lot of men have earned the living based on brawn\nNo and doing physical labor of some kind and factory work has automated so heavily why those jobs in the factory that paid well we're really dangerous but a lot of those jobs\nAre now replaced by robotics and machinery or various forms of automation and they're not coming back I mean the United states is the largest at manufacturing it's ever been with a tiny fraction of the labor it used to have\nWomen who so heavily rely on education for the field at work they go into have seen incomes rise\nMen on the other hand who are not well represented in education generally have seen and comes to climb on average not everybody it doesn't mean a college education\nBut getting a trade or skill or that something that gives you what's referred to as a skilled trade

introduce yourself Hi what's your name well this is Rob Hi\nRob it's great to have you here on the car coward show and Robbie you want to talk about how I always trash for oh three B plans\nThat strike Clark and at first I just want to say I'm I'm completely guinea talking to you I've been listening to you for decades and uh have followed your advice and also myself been interested in personal finance and investments for you know since I was a teenager a lot like you\nYes so for all three of these um as you've talked about there for nonprofits and they do have a bad rap or in some of them are still pretty lousy but my wife and I worked in a a number of organizations with for three days that have an excellent\nAnd I work in health care and she works for a think tank and we've never had anything but fantastic for three days with\nSome of your favorite companies and very low expense ratio does um so I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that not all for freebies are bad and ah when callers call and asking about their plans making sure they they look under the hood at what they've really got\nWell that is a great thing you said 'cause you know when I talk in such stark terms about four or thirty ...\nI'm trying to really shake people up and get them to do something they don't even know they can do and that is find out what they're paying for the for the ... the problem and the fourth ruby industry is so often even if somebody has\nA fines offered to them from a low cost or find house they may still be paying very high charges for administration to an insurance company that manages the four three be there at and so\nYeah that's ... go ahead a threat I I think especially um teachers have traditionally\nBeen exposed to a pretty lousy plans through their school districts and and whatever\nPlans they've they've worked out um but\nYeah and isn't it terrible at our house ... teachers get beaten up every possible way not physically but I mean\nYou know the teachers have trouble getting enough respect they have trouble getting enough pay for the hard work they do and then on top of it that generally school districts whacked the capability in house to pick\nGood for three B plans and so they just kind of say oh why don't you handle that whoever you are you go handle that or it's handled by a teacher's union that also lacks\nThe expertise to pick these plans and the teachers end up getting socked with expenses that are so high that often a teacher will end up with less money at the end of a year and they started with at the beginning because the fees are so dry norm is\nThat in the last ... financial term by the way John enormous not really a\nHousing teacher plans with three percent ... expense ratio does and as an example my plan and my wife's plan has expense ratio is a total expenses down around point ... point oh four percent so\nThat the past six or where you and your wife are is in the range of what a good for three four one K. would be also\nYeah well thanks clerked for everything you do appreciate it\nAnd I and keep saving that money\nMore you save the better off you're going to be and we're speaking now with tied tied welcome to the Clark Howard show\nType clerk it's a nice to talk to you thank you for taking my call\nCertainly Todd how can I be of service\nYeah all my life I have an emergency phones I'm just at a local\nBank and but it's not it's just a regular checking account and it's not getting any kind of return on it\nUm and so really I was just kind of wondering if you had any advice to maybe moving it I have a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent for a checking account um this one to kind of get your thoughts on that\nSo that the two percent checking accounts usually two or three or ten years ago there were five percent checking accounts the way those work is you and your wife would have to do so many debit card transactions than a month\nAnd clear them as credit card transactions you know how the debit card you'll use it somewhere or any car and they'll say debit or credit\nAnd with a debit card you can choose to say credit even though it's a debit card and then the merchant has to pay much higher fees than they would if it clears is a debit card\nSo when a credit union or a bank is offering higher interest rates on checking accounts with those accounts usually they're limited to paying the interest on our balance up to like twenty or twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you're required to do usually I think it's like a twelve to twenty depending on the bank or credit union debit card transactions a month cleared as credit and that's where the money comes from to pay the interest is from what they earn on those merchant fees\nOkay so you would most likely will kind of keep it where it's at now just political ads or I'm\nNo time for an answer all of that\nUm you can link your existing account to one of the online banks that are paying now lots of them are paying around two percent even some a little more than two percent on simple savings\nAnd the money can be moved on two days' notice you know emergency usually two days will be quick enough you move back to your regular bank\nAnd then you earn and that\nTwo percent that's going to go higher over the next six months\nGotcha and that is just simply linking the account to an online bank or is that moving it\nThat's exactly right what you do is you open an account with an online bank and you link it to your existing bank or credit union account\nAnd then the money can be moved back and forth pretty easily and I'm working right now there's a website that has a pretty good list of the online banks I'm looking at a bank rate dot com and the highest rates available today or to point two five percent\nOn simple savings\nAnd so that's that's where things are headed by the end of the year we may have the highest rates people were offering around two point five or so ... percent really simple to just link your account and\nNo you're going to get a better deal so give it a try you're listening to the Clark Howard

paid for that week but then you have to turn around and pay them usually in the thousands of dollars to take it over time share weeks or points have a negative value\nBecause you're entering into an obligation that goes on and on and on and on and you have no control what the fees are going to be for that obligation\nWhy during our show that was the last show for a a Web site\nOh well let me tell you it's funny I'm so glad you mentioned that because we just talked about this on the show recently is that I don't even know who's advertising on\nAh also an ad that appears in at the way ads are placed I don't even know who's doing that or you know where the ads are coming for who I Know where they come from but I don't know who's running ads and it could even be a local ... not one of my show ads\nSo I don't know that that there's no method that I Know of where you can actually make money\nSelling a timeshare weaker selling timeshare points because it is a a it's a defective market you know it's something for every thousand sellers there's not even a buyer so what I Would say is they need to find a use for that second week\nAnd start using it or even give it to other relatives to use the weeks as long as I'll pay the annual fees for it and one other idea that has worked for some people saw repeat it is that if you go stay at your time share week while you're there there are other people who love time shares I made a lot of that place\nAnd they may be willing to take on the obligation and have you sign it over to them you're not going to make any money but you'll end the obligation for the week\nAnd that's usually the best you can hope for with a time share I've also mentioned fake Keisha\nV. A. C. H. T. IRA which is kind of like a bulletin board for people trying to buy and ah well they don't really buy 'em they get time shares and people trying to unload time shares and you could check that out\nMichael is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael ... Michael you are a Nissan Leaf owner\nYeah sarin proud of it too I've had in mind going on for years and a ... three years ago and that's led by a lot of parts of their life\nAnd a cricket vie for later in life is kind of left your monitor and one thing I did not require as I Am going to find out about the battery has the battery life and how long does it matter laughing because the place\nAnd we're about ... ...\nOkay so ah let's deal with all that and the reverse order turn\nNear the end when the leases up even if you love it because there was a jewel in your lease is if it's like most of the Nissan Leaf says I've heard about would require you to pay somewhere in the mid teens to buy your leaf at the end of the lease that about the right man for yours\nAbout yeah OK because of right now you can buy a use leaf of an age probably similar to your three year old when you're turning in for somewhere six\nSeven or eight thousand dollars 'cause they use leaf market is flooded\nSo if you love your leaf you're probably gonna find is better to dump yours and buy another three year old when at less than half the cost you pay under residual now I'm having terrible battery problems with my belief\nThe range of it has reduced dramatically and it it it's a problem because I've really got to think about where the trip if I can take it in the leaf\nAnd mine was a very very early production model it was not a pre production is one of the first ones were pretty much commercially available in the U.S\nAnd I've heard that the batteries on the early ones like mine are very unreliable and have deteriorated quite rapidly but other people with newer we have not reported that problem at all\nBut if you do follow my suggestion turning the leaf you have when you go to buy another one you know there's that dial to the right hand side of where you charge relief that\nWill show you how much the leaf battery has deteriorated and if it's still at a hundred percent strain\nYou will be fined buying that as a use leaf this had a significant loss and the capacity of the battery if it's really deteriorated don't buy that one Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you\nI'm fine how are you\nGreat thank you you have a question for me about arbitration\nYeah you know I I listen to your show a lot and I know that you've talked about arbitration in a doctor's office or when you signed paperwork and stuff but\nI'm looking to get a new rough on my house and I'm getting a couple of bits and one of the bits I got the contract that the contractors certainly has binding arbitration in it and ah I think you always\nKind of talk down about that\nAnd I do talk down arbitration because when they impose it on you they probably picked the forum for arbitration in there\nAnd the reason it's such a rotten system is that if you agree to their arbitration and they picked the arbitrator the arbitrator only makes money\nIf they keep getting the business\nWell so

become a buyer's market neutral or a seller's market so generally at the lowest price points based on local conditions\nHouses are in the extreme seller's market so people are having trouble finding that first home they can afford\nAnd there's a there's a severe shortage of homes at the entry level point so if this condo you have is at the lower pricing range of the real estate market where you own it then you're almost certainly in a seller's market where\nYou would find the market very interested in buying your property on the other hand if it's a more at the higher end of the market the higher end is overstock now and most of the country\nAnd it would be a classic buyer's market and then kind of in between is where it's at equilibrium\nClose to where we are like ... old ... ah you said this is a condo right yes yeah where we ... old right\nNow we're lucky to possibly read out my house or show it and moved to the Congo\nAh All right so where does your house fit and the price points\nAre I think my house is shaking ... law so it's a bailout show in the ...\nWell I mean that's a lifestyle choice if you really liked the condo you haven't really had a lot of fun renting it out\nThen that's something people do frequently where they have a home and investment property is they may decide to flip and move into the investment property the advantage to you with your own home his it appreciate and a lot in value\nYes so if you sell it that's an advantage because you get to pocket as a single individual a quarter million tax free a married couple five hundred thousand and gain tax free\nIf you hold on to that and converted into a rental property eventually you lose that so if you wanted\nTo move into the rental property if there's been a big gain on that house here and

area show a little help if they saw Fager ... well\nSure sure and best to you with what you end up doing and James joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\nI'm fourteen now that I find that hundred dollars in the bank and\nWhy why why why what you were fourteen and you already have twenty five hundred bucks how'd you do that\nI collect money from Christmas and birthdays but now that I'm going on in the bank and at times\nSo you when you have received money as a gift at holiday periods and for your birthday you don't spend it you save it\n[noise] I spend a little bit of it but so it's not really have anything worthwhile lie so\nWell I don't like for you to meet my Thirteen year old son and teach him whatever it is you know because he by his own admission is a spender\nAnd I'd love it if you could re educate him to do what you've done which is to save money so let's talk James money you have this twenty five hundred what do you hope for it to be to use some day what do you hope to use it for\nWell I Am right now having a credit union bank which is pretty much getting it at two dollars a year interest\nRight now about\nTrying to put it in any unusual find your CDs and trying to get a little bit more money\nThan what do you hope at what point do you want to use the money we are you going to use it to buy a car when you turn sixteen or you know saving it for maybe are going to college like what what's the purpose of the money in your life some day\nWell I finally not touching it until I guess your college but I wasn't ready and you know a little bit and make it in the future to pay for a car or\nRight and the reason I asked that is that you would would do very well putting money into a fund and wedding at grow enough on and there are a variety of them that I like where you can put money in a you mentioned a mutual fund\nYeah I like for you to look at something known as an index fund because an index fund because it's not traded a lot you can have it in an account and you don't have to worry about a lot of it being taxed while you have it in there\nFor a low the way that just gradually make some money\nWell this is great no one idea I've talked about in the past have you ever heard of a company called fidelity investments\nI have I don't know much about them but I\nKnow that our fidelity has an account with zero minimum and zero fees and you can put your money into a fund that owns a little tiny pieces of most U.S companies\nAnd you don't I guess stock in like three thousand U.S companies and then they have another one was zero fees and zero minimum that puts money an international fund choices and you could go into a fidelity office you don't need\nSomeone who's an adult to go with you because they have to say what's knows custodian of it or you probably have a custodian\nIran right on on that credit union account and you just go in there and they'll set that up for you know the thing about doing that kind of investing\nIs in the shorter term over the next several years you know the stock market goes down your potentially in the short term show that you've lost money was not real money until you sell but if it's money here talking about leaving alone for eight to ten years till you're done with school\nThat's a great time period for you to look at putting money in there and you can add to it over time\nYou know the only the only bad side of any of this I should tell you\nIs that if you're going to go to college and apply for help for financial aid with college this money counts against you for that okay I Can't tell you how excited I Am that your age you're\nDoing this and the reason I specifically mentioned fidelity is to say have these choices with no cost and they have actual real officers you can go into and sit down with someone\nAnd have an account there and have somebody you can talk to their and so it's a great way for you to learn and learn more\nBy having the place you can go and having the actual account\nSo as you go to LA and I was in one of the mutual fund\nYou know I Want you to open the fidelity is zero index funds is what they're called the L. D. zero and they'll when you walk in an office self signs everywhere for fidelity zero yeah\nSo you just tell them that's what you want and uh I I Want to say to you I don't know if this came from inside you are if this has come from your parents or wherever you\nAre so into saving and then the idea of investing at fourteen years old but I for one am really proud of you", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "08"}
