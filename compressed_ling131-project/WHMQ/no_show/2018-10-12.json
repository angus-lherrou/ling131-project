the national Review Online right now anticipating what the army the navy and the air force need for the future I Want to shape that to China and the and the western Pacific East Asia\nDo we have the fleet to this capable of responding to these reckless incidents by the Chinese wouldn't have been better for example we've talked in the past if we'd had a ... class to run the freedom of navigation act and not put in our biggest battleships\nWell John I wrote this this essay at National Review online a which appeared yesterday in response to a series\nOf opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the Army Navy air force in the navy and in fact these are these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in\nInvesting in increased capabilities more high technology\nAnd my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have capacity to have presidents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nAnd so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both it's it's possible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time ah but I think that there's been sort of a series of false straw man that's been thrown out there\nThat attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there's some other political um you know arguments are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas or that the physical environment is getting too constrained with rising a debt and deficit\nBut you know we're in a great power competition and we either need to make the right investments to be able to survive within that competition or we don't we lose and we'd decline\nAnd therefore area denial and we have the ships to do it you know two eighty three fifty five what were we put in those three fifty five so they can deal with the Chinese aggression\nWell again we need to continue the investment in these high end destroyers which we just purchased a I had more over the next five year but we also know to buy need to buy those forget so you and I discuss on\nMany of them what about air frames Jerry what what would the navy need to deal with the Chinese rap\nFor the navy needs to make it a significant investment in modernizing its carrier air wings in order to get additional long range or aircraft back on the carrier deck and I have repeatedly called for significant investments in unmanned long range precision strike platforms in order to have the aircraft carriers be relevant up against some of the new modern standoff\nAnti access systems with the Chinese and the Russians are employing and right now we have not done that so that is an area where the navy needs to make a substantial investment to bring new capabilities on the carrier deck in order for that the aircraft carrier or to continue to exercise influence in the future\nHowever the Decatur incident or we're not going to build a fleet overnight do we have the capability right now to deal with the increased in grass aggression the south China Sea or in any of the passages in the first time and change\nRight now we're holding our own but just barely a so the\nChinese are building up rapidly and in fact\nIn in just a few years they will have a larger navy than we do a a larger navy that's not as capable but the problem that we face as China only has to be great or over ... in one area of the world right now which is essentially the western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean whereas we still have to\nTrudy everywhere in the world that we have interests which is broadly everywhere so uh our forces are spread thin or we need to build up as rapidly as we can unfortunately right now the Navy's buildup plan to three fifty five does not get us there until the twenty fifties and that will be far to a\nFar too late Jerry Hendricks captain Jerry

thousand what a woodland and four thousand farmland is there any end in sight to these ... these provocations is there a provocation coming today good morning to you\nWell hello and thanks for having me again always a pleasure to be back in\nThe situation with with regards to the tunnel you spoke about yes there was another time oh this was a ton of number Fifteen\nAttack tunnel number Fifteen ended up amongst her reply to dig\nInto Israel we intercepted it yesterday it was approximately one key llamas along and about two hundred meters inside Israel and violating Israeli territory very clear with Hamas was trying to do is to deliver\nVery inside is Rob and to try to ah ah evade our defenses but um as we have done fourteen times in the past in the last eight months we were able to detect it and destroy it this time we destroyed the from the ground\nAnd the important parts was perhaps that we saw the fifth time Hamas tried to use different techniques and the few other things\nPerhaps in order to try to evade our counter tunnel efforts and but that that wasn't successful for them and we are how could you say that's yet another\nAttempt by Hamas and quite a lot of money spent by Hamas by the way in and he\nWas it was for Israeli civilians around Gaza Strip or say\nWhat are you in Iraq Today Jonathan\nYeah today a according to all assessments will be what we would call a regular friday of the violent riots\nThey will be a ... in a thousand perhaps between a ten Fifteen thousand Palestinians will come in to six regular locations they will throw IDs resonates stones\nAnd its pipe bombs and the air rolled burning tires tools that they will try with ever what ever they have in order to infiltrate into Israel\nOr ruin secure at the infrastructure and terrorize Israeli civilians that's what we've been dealing with it every Friday now it's five day number twenty six\nAnd ... and counting and uh so that's what's in store or the idea of his ready and prepare than where I'm not going to let anyone in this time either and we are defending our communities which are just a few hundreds of meters away from the fence and for us it's very clear what's what's we have to do there\nAre the protesters dissing each friday and are they compensated by the by the Hamas and others for for the things that you've shown how this is an organized effort putting civilians ... trying to draw a fire on to them trying to penetrate or the ... isn't the St people\nIs it to is it is it because people are are compensated in and forced to come out and\nYeah it's a ... there's say a management and administrators shouldn't here and I'd say Hamas government says\nThere's a daily schedule and daily locations uh of of riots we've for instance no without on Mondays there's always a naval riot or naval attempts to penetrate into as well in the same location every Monday and every Friday\nThere are five permanent locations where where they come\nWe definitely see they even just now established Hamas established a website which participants in the riots claim a they're a so called benefits\nAnd it's been report that even in a British media imagine that that the uh participants are paid for participation and\nA double price if there was this a few hundred dollars and if they are killed during the riots which Hamas actively seeks to happen if there are kids and their families are is given the around a thousand five hundred dollars\nHave your response is that the response in the IDF changed over this time as well\n[noise] well the rules of engagement have not changed we the the basics of the situation is that they're trying to get\nInto Israel and to a threat than Israeli civilians in communities and we are not going to let them and we of course have adapted we have tried different uh less lethal means\nIn order to stop people without killing them and some of them have been successful some of them have been less successful so that was an evolution there as well but the basics of the situation they unfortunately remain the same Hamas is\nSending Fort Worth what appears to be civilians award are made to look like civilians in order to being portrayed as well and we are stopping them and protecting our sovereignty\nWhale wake up quickly you have any other border too many borders the two little times down would say um could you comment on on the prime ministers report about the missile installments what you see the new threats coming from the northern border\nWith the prime minister ... exposed to the

example of what the uranium so trying to do how they are trying to experiment on how dangerous openness relation or it is for the region on for Israel\nJonathan we just have a moment here is their expectation of a provocation that will lead to a ... a Hamas rocket mass rocket attack momentarily are they building up to a crisis we just have thirty seconds\n[noise] I think there are different they are trying to maintain the crisis I said not necessarily building up to ... they know that as long as they don't fire rockets the international media will sing their grades and promote their cause or we've seen them fodder in the past but that didn't go very well\nAnd we understand what they're what they're trying to do our mission remains the same to defend against\nThe Hamas was the

eyes Mississippi I've only seen storm seem you're out of the Adams from going on five and want to survive WHM pay [noise]\nI really do believe that he is and I think again we have to go back to that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back it's\nHard to put yourself and to put our listeners in the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall\nIs the Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running it was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure are still has not happened at the Justice Department but I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult\nTrump's nominees to get confirmed and get to work in the various agencies that the executive branch because there was so much resistance in opposition to Trump Rod Rosenstein was confirmed\nA vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support and when he wrote the call me ma'am oh\nHe was bitterly criticized by Democrats and I believe it was the first time in his life anything like that had happened and a lot of what happened in those eight days as a reaction\nA destroyed reaction to that criticism\nThe puzzle here and in this could all be cleared up with a contemporary notes that we're told exist the memos banker\nAnd page and McCain are all professionals and when they have a meeting with the department of justice especially a man who's putative Lee in charge of the department of justice because the attorney general is recused himself from many of these\nMatters that they would keep notes afterwards those notes are being taught by Congress Rosen's teen at at the reporting it said Rosen scene is not passing them to Congress nor is rose and seeing appearing\nI call upon your understanding of the department of justice defying or the capital is is sustainable and they said something to that justice can ... can to itself explain indefinitely\nI think there's one person who can decide that John and that's the president and and let me explain\nWhy I think that so um you're quite right that if all that information were put out that is all this this written work product that whatever was a done contemporaneously to memorialize these conversations that would clear up\nThe mystery that we're discussing the problem of course is that not everybody has a motive to see that cleared up publicly there may be a number of people who do but I think there's a number of people don't and I fear that Mr Rosenstein may be one of them\nAnd the reason that that is significant is that if he's left to his own devices\nAre in terms of whether this ever gets disclosed or not what I assumed he would be saying is that because these are discussions between him himself that is the deputy attorney general and the chief counsel to the FBI and someone like Lisa Page was also an ... an attorney for the FBI\nThe only person that can break that log log jam or is the president because these these uh\nExecutive privileges belong to him\nOr to the extent as any attorney client privilege here ah I I I doubt there is but to the extent there is it belongs to the president if there's any executive privilege it belongs to the president if there's any deliberative process\nPrivilege which is also a a component of executive privilege it belongs to the president so I think until the president decides to waive all that and say put the information out I Would think that Rosenstein would it be taking the position that these are things that can be withheld and don't need to be disclosed to Congress\nThaddeus [laughter] Andy ... question whether these accusations about him are\nTrue or not and I think you're right on the ground where they may be against Rosenstein why are they coming out now\n[noise] I think that he is because Baker agreed to give a interview\nTo the committee I I you know in the Trump in the Trump or news cycle\nEverything so jumps together that I Can't remember now at this point if that was two weeks ago or one week ago but I Believe it's probably a function of the fact that as we heard and we haven't seen transcripts or anything but as we've heard\nLisa Page testified some weeks back and according to people from the committee who talk and I should say it should underscore here they didn't leak her testimony but they did make an observation that she was very she seemed to be forthcoming in cooperative we haven't\nAnswered all the questions as the quote handy answered all the class I his\nRight eye but now sometimes of course John answering the questions doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's being cooperative but my understanding of the way that was described as of this pages testimony\nOr is that that was the case that she answered all the questions in a good faith way that whereas you can try and we'll have to see if we ever get to see the interview notes the transcript and then Baker who I should underscore here\nUm has a very fine reputation in terms of a a ... is um integrity and his forthrightness um you can disagree with\nJudgment calls but uh uh you know in terms of calling a spade a spade my understanding is but Baker\nHas always been pretty upright or he gave a uh he gave an interview to the committee a week or two ago and I think that he is the that the the news coverage of that\nAre coupled with this this a big story this big article that came out in the New York times again a week or two ago that sort of a constellation of facts is what has

... is here with information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nKind of a common problem you know we don't really get says I typically how often we paid our company decide fat but the issue is with so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something\nElse come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so now we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this\nUm or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more as ... you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called the event and they're only client right now is Walmart but they say they're going to be expanding\nA chart just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a\nPayday loan is it's relatively small um I talked to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee\nUm which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates ended up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks some people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for that I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some tax rate than or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charge more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know\nEat with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of ... workers are used to doing not that it's kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payment cycles um you know\nEveryday workers are now saying we I Know someone that get paid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me so that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nThe I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that for the benefit for their workers\nAnd the school district might provide the meals um doodles nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday\nJust to serve meals

school district and say that they've noticed higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how

could throw a game or to say that you can read more money to absolutely\nNuts so he went that way I thought you're going to tell me through those no no we didn't ask you to come as a ringer that would

down a lot but you can catch up one or two points if you stick with it\nYou didn't even need to use a Youtube video like mayor dinner with trying to beat him you just you just know how to do it\nThere once I got once I got warmed up it was just like a second nature to me\nHow is it different from the basement came here to planes\nOh it's a hugely different because you've got nothing wrong with you on any side watch out when the foul ball it's dark out those in a Red Sox [laughter]\nThat was being St Paul coming right our way there's about flying all over the place where they\nDidn't carry why is this a cause that you wanted to come and support this morning with part from the fun of ping pong lives supporting refugee resettlement in our area something you wanted to support\nWell it's such a great causing the good work the Catholic charities do in this area ended so many different areas I was happy to support but you know\nTaking care of each other is such a crucial part of what we need to be doing every single day whether there's it's our neighbors we live next to forever rich people come into town now\nAnd the issue that the Catholic charities really focuses on with these are resettled refugees is their housing you know among other things but we don't have enough for housing around here and for folks coming in who don't know the system or don't have a job yet it's really really struggle they really struggled to\nFind that housing sometimes when you can really take some some harsh steps backwards if you're living on the streets and you can really Jim yep so the fact that people are coming and they're really in a time of need and we can help them do that is hugely important and the fact that I can a double my donation by beating Bob\n... and it doesn't hurt [laughter] I was doing\nYes Joe update on the game between you and you'll come up\nFor it right now it's nine to three but I have three who you are but look at Joe ... she sets up on every point like

service\nIs that you should they were able to say that women\nSo far no mom or your personal of had the travel east but the fact they're willing to drop everything to do so there's a lot about the quality and character of the Jones employees and the people who lead them well placed on Chris called\nLike is this really so am I really doing is I Do I really have the opportunity to have\nThis it's after so much that they've gone through that it's hard for them to believe that so many people can be so kind and that so many people care about their livelihood\nHaving that thousands of others who don't really care and that circle\nOf care group in North Hampton they they're angels aren't they really\nAre they are you know the the thing that\nAlways true about this is that do you do the model that we had hoped to do it could not have been done unless there were the volunteers who were willing to be partners with us and this and\nWe have been so fortunate and everyone has um just this deep sense of their obligation towards their brothers and sisters no matter who they are\nThat's Katherine Buckley Bronner from Catholic charities who has a refugee resettlement project\nWhich is the

process to making sure that they get find employment um sell us how this money will be huge Kevin Buckley runner up that funds the refugee resettlement project what sort of things does this go toward\nThe money that has raised today a goes to actually meet their basic needs\nSo during the first year you can imagine that it takes a while for them to acclimate\nTo um actually learn the language and although they are hired fairly quickly because of the good and kind hearted people that we have come across [noise] um it still takes time to build up when you start with nothing\nTakes time to build toward something so we use the monies to do rental assistance and other kind of basic necessary necessity assistance for them\nThis money directly going through that fund a refugee

involvement the Jackson Street and move on and a welcoming dinner why is this a cause that's important to you\nYou know if we're to believe\nThe founding story of our nation that we are many of us have come many of our families have come as immigrants to this nation and we need to extend the same welcome to others who are experiencing crisis and you know it is so complicated for us right now\nAs our borders become more and more rigid and close\nTo people experiencing crisis so you know what I think about today is that it's a really a political act that WHM pie and Bob are taking on a Catholic charities right were defying the status quo that's currently in our nation\nAnd that's that's the same intensity that was present at the welcome dinner when we were afraid that Syrian refugees for example would be blocked from the country Syria country undergoing an intense war and famine and needing a place to go in the Syrian refugee crisis that was sweeping Europe still is sweeping Europe\nAnd and so that was the spark of this but of course it's intensified and the need for countries like the United states that has so much to open our borders and welcome in families who are looking for a new life\nIt is you know we it is such wrongs thinking to imagine that welcoming refugees is uh in any way other than beneficial to a nation that is of course the most beneficial to welcome in New people to a nation wanting to start a new life\nCatholic charities and bring it to us that's the challenge of everybody who wants to be part of the circles of care that Catherine has talked about you know it's the challenge for all of the the no no we're going to open our doors\nAnd you can meet that challenge right now by coming by zinc table tennis in East Hampton are making a

owner of zinc\nNo Abbott thank you so much for joining us and thank you for doing is making your your business available and for raising money\nFor refugee resettlement thanks for doing it tell us why you want it to\nDo this good morning bill it was very clear that refugees need a hand they need a lot of support\nUm last year when I learned was that when refugees come into this country they come in often from horrendous circumstances they come in in ways that are really very life threatening\nThey have been ripped from home they'd been ripped from their country they'd been ripped from their community they actually don't speak the language in most cases although sometimes they speak three or four or five other languages other than English something we don't do with our large borders and that's very true bill\nAnd when people are getting settled and sending them roots in a new country in a new area they need support\nMost of the times um it takes at least the or anyone who's ever moved to do a new location knows from their own experience that it can take a year or two or three to set down roots and feel connected so\nEffort here is just one small part of\nReally supporting the effort of people who are making a new life and there was no question when Bob came to me and said that he said are you willing that just leaped out of me losing is the place of inclusion and that includes\nEveryone [noise] and that's\nHeartwarming and moving\nI'm Wondering if there's anything in your background other than obviously your deep feelings for other people that that made you want to do this is some involving you've had with uh someone who's been a refugee or your personal family stories or something there\nWas just really literally from the goodness of your heart [noise]\nI think that when people grow up in um life almost no one is scape challenge and trauma and somehow tennis as sport saved my life\nAnd table tennis I came to actually only about four years ago I made my living as the tennis pro after college\nBut table tennis for me was an expression I finished about seven years of public service\nAnd ice seizing now there's a place to play ping pong or table tennis the same thing different name only but as the place to welcome people it's a place of safety and inclusion\nAnd when I reach the age of forty I came to a conclusion about men I can only talk about men because I Know as women give birth and have children they have a very different kind of trajectory in certain ways\nAnd so for men I came to the conclusion that when then reach a certain age that could be the forties or the fifties\nMaybe earlier maybe later\nThey reach a very stark choice and that's a stark choice is give or die and I choose to give and this is a vehicle for that giving in that expression\nIt's a place of beauty is a place of competition it's a place of learning and exploration\nAnd sing is meant to be welcoming and by the way ping pong table tennis is fun\nAt all levels it's also one of the most popular\nSports internationally so there is a natural scientists to a global perspective on on our beautiful\nPlanet yes let's not forget that the United states and China managed to reconnect\nOver ping pong\nIn Nineteen Seventy two with the team pong diplomacy or by the way for all you beginners out there mark November Seventeen Saturday twelve\nIt was thirty

Administration has reduced significantly by I think almost Seventy percent the number of refugees who will be allowed into the country this coming year and that's a tiny fraction of what other developed countries have allowed into their countries as refugees\nBut I'm Wondering if you think there is something the state can do or what do to help the refugees who are allowed into our communities\nIt's such a huge example right there of how important it is to get involved and how important local community action is in local government is in on this the level we need to be doing

way that one that\nI get nervous about trap door I don't want to get it within a born into back in the house it it's it's not that hard I got ya we got to cover up just look out anyway that would double double double balance on their own Bob sorry\nYou know you hear a lot of mercy on that when\nYou're a lot about radio radio bits and stuff\nWhen he when we first talked about this last year I thought he was crazy\nI Love help without charities but to play paintball for twelve hours and my God he was pressuring twelve last year and he was when he started\nAnd it looks like that's going to be the case here I don't I Try not to kick in and he was just to go [noise]\nThat's all that was all a little like little flick a pretty big metal to me oh\nWe know that way or that he knew that was way over there\nOh thanks dude is nice to have to go ahead and donate to space for today's vote event that's all right thank you very much for the great staff there\nMust be appreciated\nBob seems to

time to go ahead and stop ... studios the time it's certainly for forty\nWe're gonna be broadcasting live until at least six thirty this evening\nBob says maybe seven but we have UMass hockey to bring to the events right\nSo I I understand that there's there is a an art to this game and I've never quite understood 'cause whenever I see a ball and the ... my my first if it gives a smashing as hard as possible get what you really have to have sort of a dexterity inability to control yourself which waved goodbye to me a long time ago\nUnique super quick reflexes that's for sure good hand eye coordination reflects thing I got but I for me my or just to just drive the ball down somebody's throat that and I suppose it has to hit the table first though yeah you're going to get all your data how much to offer\n\nBut I tell you we were watching the wonderful to be over there and they were showing some Olympic pong going on and I don't know how they do it [laughter] no idea how they did it\nWell it's just it's it's keeping an eye on the ball but it's also you have to exhibit some sort of self control too because if you try and overdo it you're going to hit long or\nEven though the game is fast they don't take a break it is continuing the mini start again it goes until somebody wins it\nUnless you like Bob and take if you break the wrong way but not that that will I'm after that it's twelve hours\nExactly exactly Bob is nursing a stick of some type of food over there they get the chicken chicken skewer your\nThere's just one last all over the floor here I\nI'm not supposed to
