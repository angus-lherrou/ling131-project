I Would like to ask is um at at what point\nDoes appeasement at what point does neglecting North Korea's crimes against humanity turn into endorsement of the egregious human rights violations\nBeing perpetrated in North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the state\nSo Gregg we can put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that to moon\nJae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how you came to prominence um many people say well you know it's a course ironic now that is not raising the issue of human rights so maybe the question is\nWas he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo oppose of people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like his senior advisors now\nI'm very much sympathizers for North Korea\nWe don't know the answer the question we don't know what's the moon's head but the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea is human rights violations\nA he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nUnemployment rate among young uh college graduates it's high and still on the ice remember that the important part of president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying ah most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process\nWell we'll see a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended\nSome um democracy activists were basically working against the military dictatorship up until the late Nineteen eighties uh of course she was a a lawyer on several Robin ... says that involved um marks chests and Marxist material course\nAt the time um that type of materials bad\nSo uh actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea\nDoes not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be that equally active on North Korea Kim writes\nBut then again being a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes against humanity and does on the go ahead\nAnd on that point let's talk about Amanda's letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the chosen ... the south Korean newspaper um tell our audience what amended asked of Moon Jae Amanda ... oh go ahead Gregory\n... widow as my colleague shes our human rights attorney or a chart\n... oh go ahead Gregory\nAmanda ... widow as my colleague shes our human rights attorney or a charge gate you mirage treasure Nicaragua based in so uh there was a terrific letters you published in the coastal meal but we should go to the very basic question that she asks from a human rights lawyer\nTo another human rights lawyer should tell him look I have witnessed\nUm I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both understand uh basically when\nAre you going to take these violations seriously Mr President when at what point are we going to see your administration getting serious about the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question so let me come back to ... does he have a plan to your knowledge to transition from this ah generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability as a as a as a transparent leader of people\nThat is a ... to ... ... is there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea is engaged\n[noise] ah well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\nI'm a chest we improve the human rights record up north Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tourism projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people Powell large to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so these are not necessarily a projects that will help\nThe people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea humid watch policy I have seen them encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations to set something along the lines that South Korea is an active participant in the drafting of the U.N General assembly a resolution on North Korean human rights now in ...\nWill have to leave it there Gregory Scott ... of the committee for human rights Gordon in North Korea Gordon Chang I'm ... [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nDo any age him be [noise] mostly clear when the sun I overnight lowest twenty or thirty four sunny breezy on Thursday a higher forty to fifty to friday\nThere's a lot of people out there Allen who say look you know the supply chains are stuck in China it will never ever change agree or disagree\nWait I Want to crowd in with the economist conventional wisdom from lousy economy oh gosh look guys it's my job in life to read the economists I'm going to report what are better you to be John I enjoy and a great deal I had an alternative life as an English public school boy okay that's where I Am fine All right\nThis is written from the point of view of understanding the queen okay fine\nThe argument is that the supply chain in electronics specifically electronics is deeply in China deeply engaged in China because China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace shot however there is migration underway to Vietnam and\nIndonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned and\nThat going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices you getting smaller we're getting rid of chords we're getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they\nAre the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become a little bitty ... servers it is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yeah\nYou know John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over is that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing in China but you know the more important story is that see jumping the Chinese\nFirst of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and China but you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China\nAnd I think what he's doing for various geopolitical lens that he has his making China an unreliable member of the global supply chain so companies for that reason alone are going to lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supply chain um vulnerabilities and get out of\nChina Allen you are Mr supply chain what say you\n... I hate to say it but Gordon's got it right I Would\nGo oh my lord realm I learnt let me fall off my chair for a moment like if you're a leadership foul and they got it to this\nThank you so much um let me just make two quick points first of all what what free trade extremists uh publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful than the u._s. government jerk around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment\nThat for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's always wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can and secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of\n... of shifting production outside China that's either\nAlready taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know\nThat we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and PS they are not panicking and all they have have\nRepeatedly said that you know weight of course rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but\nWe think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information technology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I oh by the way that that includes Mexico because that would really help this country is southern neighbor\nWhich which desperately needs it\nAnd ... and ... by extension\nHelp the United states for men to sleep and I think that that that is far from implausible\nFor a carton apple and apple most\nApple can move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple um hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn of course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John and Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan\nI moved to China yes the economist reminds all of us that many of the factories were talking about in China are owned by the Taiwanese or Taiwanese investors have created them in addition that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties of portability has happened already\nYeah and it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots\nThat makes it a lot easier to move because that limit doesn't eliminate but it's certainly reduces substantially China's labor costs advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economists did make one good point and that is that that as electronics products become more sophisticated\nOf for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production so highly automated there's no more China cost advantage and Foxconn in fact this in the process of making a very considerable investment than advanced electronics reduction in Wisconsin\nSo we could very well have the\nThe result that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's walk them in perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nOut of my life that that's a that's a severe use of walkman I was thinking about you know the everything you need to know about pac man is in China okay one more detail sure one more detail of concern here that I've had for some time\nThere's a new phone from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on how and why are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer\nOf advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China or way has become a global leader in the latest generation of that telecommunications technology which is called five gee um and and certainly wall where he wants to be a big player in this she was\n... when you when you we don't allow packs of cigarettes for thirty cents on the street in Manhattan I Would say well why don't we allowing a wall way phone in our borders for that is poison\nWell you're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to us\nOff guard in the news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way it's that there is no privacy worthwhile wait it can't last\nLong ... yeah I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the ...\nThe Chinese were calling and why it's the People's Liberation army the state within a state he is our this state security spy\nSure I mean they they do make these handsets they are sold in the U.S they have been but I don't think we're very much longer because of the

they solve their problems or do we hold our breath and see if it works couldn't even if you Brenda\nWell good evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question\nI'm back home in Florida we have a saying even apply pay confided slot bowl once in a while um the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties but to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies at our share of technical difficulties\nWith our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd uh they are they are offering that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we should be the way we did against the Soviets in space and so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect\nA the technology they're trying to ah create and you\nWant to translate quickly there's among writes on and there's only one contestant is that is\nThat's that is one hundred percent correct yes\nGordon friend and I'd like to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said which I think is critically important which I think every American news to hear\nAnd that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten million dollars\nA lot of people in Google or upset that um this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil\nBut I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were affective way the partner on the other side is the People's Liberation army if you could just run through back because there are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing it is an ex industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first\nIt's basically like having the cotton gin you know of the ... revolution it it will completely change the way the world works uh the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's a physics has shown that to a particle can exist in the ...\nAnd basically without getting into the mechanics of it it's a physics has shown that to put up a particle could exist in the same place it existed to different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that\nParticle to transfer encrypted data between the two particles I Am it's worked they've been\nTested this twenty sixteen from that technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the F thirty five that multi trillion dollar a program of ours to build the great stealth fighter\nThey can see through it and they're married that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we\nAnd they have reached out to Google about a year ago and Google has expressed interest in not only sending over talent to this a massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nUh but Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military ads in the same way that Google and apple investment into a I research artificial intelligence research in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes\nLet me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest in participating in the pie LA's\n... advanced advanced work on AOL and quantum cute ... corner and quantum computing at the same time Google's employees have raised a rile when Google was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft\nFor the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon\nI lay out this to ask very clearly Gordon\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and just standing the transparent military that protects Google copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation that I can think of John and this is something that I think the first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether I'm you know and the company which is his headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country\nIs permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is bigger in to kill Americans\nAnd Brandon have you seen Google addressed this paradox in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they're they're they're continuing to seek to do business in China I Will say though are in both cases of the the AI and the quantum computing\nOr the Saturday Night actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but I went less awareness has risen I think\nAh I think that things will go on without the American people knowing until it's too late and so what part of my\nMy hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas\nInvesting in the centers that could be used to it or leave defeat the United states uh enough you know whether it's economic\nOr military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a man by the last game of Slater way of twenty second thread oh go ahead or basically\nThe there was at the English English mint is the reason why we won the industrial

Lara Brown\nGeorge Washington university to comment as a political scientist with days to go twenty Twenty one days to go to the midterm election what we see in the polling and how this comport with political science\nHistory about midterms following a close election or a White House held by the opposite party to the ambitious out of power party Laura a very good evening to you I think I cage that enough so that I I didn't get too far ahead of myself\nThe elections that you are profiled these last weeks and months we've been talking about this indicates that the Democrats are on the edge of doing the obvious which is winning the house from the Republicans somewhere between twenty six and thirty six seats is enough\nAt this point there's chatter about a blue wave there's also chatter about a red where\nDo you think do you see anything inconsistent and the polling and the polling is very careful I'm watching the New York times polling they pull every night and they give the numbers as they do it do you see anything in the polling to indicate a an interruption in the conventional wisdom that the Democrats will win a majority in the house of representatives good evening to\nGood evening thanks for having me on the most difficult part about polling is that pollsters half to\nEstimate and this is where the art is what\nThe turnout is going to look like and\nThe heart of that usually happens through screens of registered voters they asked them how likely you are to vote so you get what are called likely voters screens some of it also happens I'm through the responses themselves\nYou can start to tell by the the amount of sort of information people have\nAre the enthusiasm that they have in certain questions that you ask them um how likely they are to participate and all of that\nInformation kind of helps a pollster understand what turnout may look like\nBut the problem is we're in something of an unusual mid term environment we're seeing both parties bases ... very enthusiastic I'm almost equally enthusiastic not quite but almost and\nInterestingly enough people are saying that they're planning on voting with a high degree of certainty and that is just not\nUsual in a midterm election in other words mid term elections yes we have this dynamic of waves\nYes there are times where all of the sort of the enthusiasm of the out party builds up and sort of cast this referendum vote against the president but what we're seeing in this instance\nUp and sort of cast this referendum vote against the president but what we're seeing in this instance is it both parties bases are very excited I'm and we're not really sure a little bit about the middle of the electorate\nThe middle of the electorate is nonpartisan it's either independent or not terribly excited either way it's waiting for that last week under that last day so is there another way to judge George to measure or to guess mid term does the money tell the story lower\nWhen money certainly\nCan suggest some enthusiasm and it is true that money has uh some very real impacts on whether or not candidates are able to win I think as political scientists have long studied and Gary Jacobsen is I'm sort of high on the list of canon of\nPolitical scientists who have understood these dynamics but\nOne of the things that is true is that incumbents have to raise money\nBut because they are already known they usually\nUm are raising money in a defensive posture in other words um they need to raise\nMore than the challengers but at the same time I'm every dollar that they spend doesn't help them as much as say a dollar a challenger raises and spends and that just has to do with the familiarity\nOf these candidates challengers are usually not known so every dollar that they spend um does\nMore to help them advance their causes in other words there's a better marginal return on their dollars spent but the truth of the matter is for both\nCandidates the challenger and the incumbent there is essentially a saturation level um or there is a diminishing returns that go with the additional dollars spent\nI'm told look I'm told about that saturation level that we passed it about a week ago that there are the ... minutes left on any TV channels anywhere in the important battleground districts\nThat's right and of course so much of half of this is also happening on line so there's a lot of digital advertising um where people are spending money but really what you're looking at here is\nIf a challenger hopes to sort of beat an incumbent they need to raise typically at least half as much as the incumbent raises and spend that amount\nWhat is pretty extraordinary about the election we appear to be in is that\nMany of the Democratic challengers have out raised the Republican incumbents\nThat usually doesn't happen it is a rarity and it does suggest that the energy is on the Democratic side of the aisle but we do have to realize that um challengers need to kind of be known if they're going to essentially\nWhen there's a twist there too I saw the New York times feature of the story that the candidate for the Democrats in Texas a roar this is the Senate candidate against Ted Cruz has raised some spectacular amount of money tens of millions thirty eight million was not named I don't know what the total some is\nAnd and it's not spreading it around the way Congress of the way members of Congress usually do and so there's all and all a lot of the money this is New York times reporting was coming from California and New York in other words not from Texas\nAnd that's the power of online that's the power of crowd funding but at the same time I wonder if that's effective money Laura is that a detail the political science can help with\nWell at the end of the day all money is good money and that you can spend it I mean I Do think that one of the things that Beto O'Rourke\nHas um declared is that he's not taking pac contributions so that is helping him at this level at which he can say all of this money\nWherever it's coming from is happening through individuals giving to me\nUm and that does allow him to spend an extraordinary amount he did thirty eight million in the third quarter he did twenty three million in the second quarter so there is no doubt he has plenty of money for all of the media advertising buys he wants to do um\nThe real question is will it persuade any Republicans because obviously the challenge for ... or ... is the voter\nUnderline voter distribution and registration\nIn Texas we know that there are more Republicans there though there are many Democrats who are not registered and this is sort of the new fight of the Democratic party which is to you engage in persuasion or do you try to\nTurn out voters who has not voted before and in some of the states that they're in right now in particular some of 'em these more contested typically Republican states like\nGeorgia I'm you are seeing a lot of of questions about um ... who can actually vote and who should be voting\nLargest to detail her with less than a minute to go the conventional wisdom also says that the Republicans retain the Senate in some fashion whether it's a pickup or Sam pet do you see anything to interrupt that we have about thirty seconds\nYou know again I think this is where\nThe underlined distribution of voters matters a great deal um if you look at those states where Democrats are on the defensive\nGranted they are incumbents and they've raised money but they are in very Republican states and with the enthusiastic Republican base it will likely be hard to secure those votes for them\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's a professor at George Washington university I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

or a member of that before they launched that's ... that's pretty which was they plan to launch a little bit early as they have the other rockets with unmanned payloads which was military satellites essentially all lined up to me that that is that the lights on one cargo ship or to the station so those\nAre the so that their decision to launch the crew will be based on a successful launches so

had a show where they six six five votes jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six we're talking with attorney simply Powell\nAbout the apparent murder on the Saudi Government property a consulate in Turkey a dissident journalist and we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Cape cod and the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh highest is thinking that\nThey're seeing them to in my memory and there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence indicating that the Saudi Government was in any way and bald\nLet me uh let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was they may linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope he should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's help\nIn there a dilemma that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts on the beach to another caller\nTemp in trying to think about different things that might can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number\nOf a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here I'm not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm yes I mean I see your point there as Jim an hour talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody to us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give us air pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and put your demo for seven minutes by all accounts\nOr I'm not giving them a mass either I'm just not sure why there's a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the apparent brutality again what we have so far or ... or you don't pass it off no no no no just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got\nThat name and when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets to be headed during an entire and we have here why aggressive as soon as I heard that I Would say that what that means is they tortured him to do that very thoroughly agree on it have you\nHas it as if this has never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not using it I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose to spite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nHave won't feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when\nYou have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\nAnd even even at even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... shower in ... just finished my statement before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or for this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict portrayed\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very ethnical anesthetic go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone in the\n... obviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion the answer of course the one I pose was it wouldn't be better\nAnd until you come up with some kind of a better answer other than just were outraged that we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... you know you thought from used to be as we go to the next call here\nWe do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our our strategic military interests around the globe\nFirst both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime as ever accidentally brutal way well guess what it is and I'm so sorry that the human condition just as bad as it is but it is and the notion that never happened before and all of human history I Would say how

suddenly Powell about\nThis apparent murder in a Saudi consulates in Turkey and do we have a call from Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much Jim and push shaded and this is a real hot but it's a man has been for many years have failed to comprehend it somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know wind\nThey're real hot button for may and has been for many years have failed to comprehend is somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions\nOf dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reported she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life that she showed where the Saudis\nHave fourteen carriages go five states in their account Barnes why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that uh they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is it a little hard to understand\nI don't understand it all I don't I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them one time\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different but they are someone who can be useful to his who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think ... point is extremely well taken\nA one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\nHey Jim of just calling to suggest uh I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... a wooden just when they've got this guy on the on the consulate\nWouldn't just we're focused path for a which is certainly within their borders to sell\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is a story on page six in the New York times\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and uh I I think that the again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick again it unless unless we really think Sydney power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality or could they sent their message out I mean I Would think the ... just described would end up itself be or shall we say I'm a pleasant enough aid to send a message to dissidents\nWell it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman medieval sort of regime\nAnd they're barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me that they have generally been\nPretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance uh maybe that's\nWhy they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass oh okay you're only tried to maybe a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that and I'm\nCertainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers the within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is a target dissidents that hardly makes them a savory character and that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having freedom chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd everything ... says that um and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stupid as kids pull a stand like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened you\nKnow we do but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulate consulates these are not just places like boutique some of the shopping center where you just wander in now but people\nCan decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about John Brennan maybe on something and it may have been done and partly make Trump look bad and and make a ... with you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean the I don't see any game here for the risk involved\nBut I'm saying that right before the election this isn't you know causing the administration headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it they're listening to this is not this is not the Iranian nuclear deal is is not a a jobs than anything else I mean although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda\nThat ah that one tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I I think that the minister Asians handling it very well but I think I Do think it's being blown way out of proportion like yeah we we've been talking about it for many data that we you know yeah\nLike uh okay Sydney or take\nI really

saw earlier this year we went to a game at the beautiful seats\nAre right behind home plate with the Astros and I mentioned that at the time that I was astounded that or excuse me from\nYes I had to press the button so you wouldn't know I was coughing or uh yeah the er I told her for the\nThe crowd was half full this would've been back in what August and the crowd was half full of Astros fans\nAre they had to somehow they had to secure these tickets waited bands it's such a pretty tricky anyway to get Red Sox period and a somehow there had to cut it to the tune of Fifteen thousand tickets I had got they're also in town for the uh the Houston Texans we're going to be at Fox were to take on the path so\nA lot of these people who I guess had money to burn a they somehow do that they somehow got tickets for both uh games but our ... since socks 'cause they're so hard to come by or was surprised there were so many\n... fans all the orange jurors all the going let's go to a stroke\nAt least they didn't bring those God awful things that they get at the park those fuzzy orange things that they waved to hold him oh my God who comes up with that and can you imagine if you're not one of those that has to play along with the sheep if you're if you're one of those that actually wants to God Forbid see the game\nAnd then in front of you all you have these orange fuzzy things that are if people are waving the hold on I don't know other than that though I I was very impressed with the behavior of the Houston fans they all seem very nice we talked to several of them they're all our section\nYou know they're all ... they weren't of noxious they the you know it was it was kind of nice to see so but you got to get rid of al ... man they ... they wouldn't dare do that if there were park I guess because very park is known for that they're not known for\nRally monkeys and things like that you know I think maybe I don't know it has something to do with the region I think I I don't think the red Sox fans buy into the conceit\nThat the fans make a difference so I I think that's kind of refreshing because the fans do not make a difference to nothing the fans do they get inspired team in one ... you know in any way shape or form\nBecause the fans only help you when you you already helping yourself so that the team gets second third of bases loaded all of a sudden the parents come to light\nSo you already have to do something nor to do to inspire the fans of the things don't inspired the players like players ignore the fans but they pretend they pretend to\nSo you already have to do something nor to do to inspire the fans so that things don't inspired the players players ignore the fans but they pretend they pretend that they go we've got the greatest fans in the world but anyway um for some reason I really wanted to to pay attention to this game\nAnd so I had it on and then I went to bed do you remember I get up in the middle of the night I don't think the the schedule or where they have these games so like it was it was twenty nine for this game start who comes up with this\nWho was a straight face sits down and besides that's a good time to start a game\nAnd it's still going well up until midnight so arm or I don't think I'm the only one either just because I get up in the middle of the night I think a lot of people are exhausted this morning from Sam so people will stay up that late in fact there's a new movement or we saw a ... one of our favorite bands from when we first started dating Emory myself\nI'm back in the late seventies the um the English Beat that we saw the gate which for the arts and there's a new movement afoot I guess it because of the a lot of people to go out to these shows they're they're seen acts that they used to love the back in the day\nWhile they don't want to stay out to one in the morning you know these are people that work these are in middle age people like myself and even younger that that worked for a living so I\nYou know they're not club poppy and like they used to do and the old days so they start gated they start to shows now seven o'clock eight o'clock or that they don't have to do a lot of the opening knacks anymore so\nIt's it's kind of refreshing was so we get out of there was a reasonable time you have a very good to know what to do with ourselves but uh so I I Know for a fact that people don't want to step this late so anyway I put the TV on in the bedroom very rare thing that it's hardly ever done\nUh I put the TV on in the bed and then I just to go to bed and I'm you know kind of hearing things ... and you know bits and pieces whenever Brock holds up for instance I sit right up my favorite restaurants ... so I sit right up and ah and then I'll go I'll just they were just mentioning him he's not actually up so it's kinda weird kind of a weird sleep\nSo I don't know how this is going to go to call\nOh no no no nothing but anyway so forget me\nAnd my gardener crazy a schedule I think the the average person can't stay up this like did you do what did you actually make it five six seven one for or if you made it through the whole thing with all your chin on your chest okay\nSo but uh yeah so I I'm In and out all night I'm snoring one minute and a brother and my eyes the next is the seventh inning or ... since the eighth inning and uh somewhere around ... about the eighth inning I got up and kind of gave it to put my glasses on of course it's like well after midnight just born\nComes up with is like and this is all I guess because of ads for me to make a lot of money on ads the ads that nobody watches and so I don't know I don't I don't get it\nHey if you're looking for a job and you're over fifty of today's the day by the way at the senior senator

the red Sox are you I'm not I can't do that I Would be irresponsible if I actually uh try to stay on although I did and I watched a few innings course they had the fan interference\nOr which was kind of interesting actually ... the manager parents call\nOr if you are knowledgeable about baseball which I Would venture to say maybe half the fans in the stands actually are uh this is the reason why they have to put nets up the last time I was at Fenway Park early received and\nI didn't realize this they now have the nets not just behind home plate but they have them all the way down to the right field corner all done or feel cornered the reason they do this because everyone is on a cell phone so instead of the ... you have a big sign turn your cell phones off like you would do in the library or something like that or don't bring\nSo instead of the ... having a big sign turn your cell phones off like you would do in the library or something like that or don't bring your stupid cellphones in to the park\nOr they can't control it and so in the middle of the game\nOr people there was a guy in front of us when we were watching the Astros play the red Sox fmri park or earlier this year guard in front of us who was on his cell phone the whole time and the whole time the whole game wasn't just checking email here and there and the ball game\nAnd so okay now these are pretty good seats that we got ... okay they're very very nice seats about ten rows up from home plate\nOr you know how we got these my guard\nA bus to pay for the seats would have been impossible so this does not have had to pay for the seat in studies on a cell phone and you can plainly see what he was looking at\nWhich is nothing like cat videos and stuff like that it wasn't like he was you know in the middle of his thesis or something and and had to check on on comments from professors or nothing like that no it was just looking in the whole time never even raised his eyes to look at the action on the field\nSo anyway there's a lot of people like that and then there's a lot of people don't quite get to know what's going on a baseball I mean I was always taught from the time I was a kid\nThat if you were sitting on the first base side and they are right handed batters up then you better be ready for foul balls okay you you bring your glove when you were a kid you even adult spring gloves which is a good idea and it's hard to catch a ball was hit that hard\nAnd then uh and vice versa if you're on the third base Arkansas left handed batter up you better be ready for foul balls you know fall ball slashing right your way\nUh now I guess that knowledge is not passed on anymore and so therefore they have to put up and that's because people are getting hit in the head 'cause they get their head outlook on a cell phone so it's a it's it's crazy so but ah anyway um are you going somewhere with this helped me helped me\nA yeah oh yeah so are people who stayed up all night to watch this thing you know I Try to do it I I\nI got I got pretty far into it now above that fan of defendants called it was right off the bat ah ... hit what looked like a home run except to also looked like he was going to Rob him and he was right under the you know great athlete that he is and they looked like he had the thing that wind up pretty well and is going to make\nA quite a spectacular catch to Rob ... of the home run\nAnd then uh yeah he um somebody moved his glove reaching over trying to catch the thing and and and that was pretty much it let's uh let's go to the phone lines that no I guess they weren't aware\nOh you were there a moment to go\nAnd you know our phone lines don't don't light up very well you know it's not like a big alarm goes off the phone is ringing the phone is ringing the photos of like that it is a little painting we'll let you know like I can barely see the letters on the screen right now and I'm like I Try to judge this uh ... uh but anyway you could you can call me back we're going into a break here in a minute but anyway\nBut um yeah uh ... didn't exactly reach over but certainly got in the way\nOf the field of trying to make a catch it everybody remembers the ah\nThe thing in Chicago many years ago it looked like the Chicago Cubs\nWho had had a A R World Series drought much like the red Sox they had the first one was a goat than they have a boat or something the curse him much like our curse of the band bean or for the red Sox and uh they were poised to when they're on the on the play offs to get into the airports within say yes and also yes\nAnd there are poised to get in there and then have to salute ... um\nYeah the other a little ah yeah the descendant of ... who\nWas a a poised to make the catch in left field and then a guy or a cubs fan with a cubs jak at the cubs happening was Bachmann a reaches over to try to make the catch and then a screwed up the play and then the the cubs went on to lose as they ... you know because of the curse\nWith this guy was vilified to bark and they had his number his name was phone number he got death threats he had to leave the park that very day\nIf you look at the picture itself if you look at the pitcher itself or you will see that there are twenty fans also trying to make that same catch them poor Bartman for Steve Bartman lifelong cubs fans from the time he was like nine years old\nLifelong a cubs fan he's vilified for life right ... death threats all the time still gets death threats to this day\nAnd uh but none of that what happened last night they didn't showcase the person who screwed up like there were also three or four people last night trying to do the same thing but of course one person is always singled out as the as the villain or anyway we've got a seven

to the community and doing other things together also I think that you know women like to congregate as well and do social things together and so there are a lot of activities\nThat bring people together at the senior center and so if it's your first time at the senior center or you've been coming for a long time there's always something new to try and people than me and a place where you can fit in\nUm maybe developed a new hobby or continue doing something that you usually do alone but in a new way\nYou know go to the gym is an interesting thing for seniors you used to go look sore thumb uh it's it's mostly young people in the old boss and you know we'll muscle tone are going on seniors want to stay fit to a lot of them so they don't really want to go down to the local gym with all the young pups what are the exercise programs and he'll say\nWell we're really developing a lot of programs there's there's been a lot going on and I and I think there is something to meet most people's interest but I think it's becoming more and more apparent through research going on around brain health that being active\nIs really really important to keep your brain healthy and your body healthy and it and to sort of forego\nSome health risks that can come up as you age so being a member at the at the fitness center is affordable and we're open all day so really it can fit into your schedule very well to an orientation so you learn how to use the equipment and then there are a classes there serve all a cart\nThat you can choose from so if if you are you're feeling like you need to start out slow there's something for that um if you really want to get in there and do something very active there zoom bust and low impact kinds of classes where um people are really animated in building off each other's energy and\nHaving fun so you don't have to feel competitive or push yourself too fast there's really not that kind of element that you find at the gym where you may feel out of place or behind the game\n... the director of senior services at the senior center in North Hampton mass I've talked to a lot of people especially older guys when they lose their wife or now their nutrition goes downhill they might have a total can't sardines for lunch or something like that can you help guide out [laughter]\nYeah so I'm working a lot on developing 'em food programming at the senior center and not only is important to have a\nWell rounded meal but I think it's really important to eat to gather and not be eating alone all the time we don't eat as well when we were just taking care of ourselves we need to share food and community and the meals that we're serving right now for lunches at three dollar meal for seniors and it's very healthy\nAnd you can actually also take it to go so if you if you want to take it home for dinner\nSo you don't have to cook later that that's also available we have a coffee shop and we're now doing\nFresh baked goods and we will be doing offering some prepared foods that you can purchase to go as well we have a farm share senior red bag farm share available on site during the season where people can come and really we have our own little farmers market inside the senior center which has\nBeen really nice for people so I I think that if if you're stuck at home because you're not driving or you'd like to get out more you don't want to drive in bad weather you know you can come down on the van and\nGet involved in programming have a nice meal\nAnd meet some some people um and get involved in activities that can really become part of a regular routine to you know not isolated at home or if you're recovering from surgery it's a great way to sort of\nFill some of those needs during a transition so we were down at sixty seven ... street contact information for the senior center and you can find on the city website as well as the caller said five eight seven one to two eight\nWhat's the population now or you know I'm a baby boomer myself and they talk an awful lot about this growing population of the baby boomers which we kind of invented youth so it's hard to prove to make of us was getting old we never thought that would ever happen but the what's the population right now the euro while they're over eight\nThousand seniors in North Hampton they've population is going to continue to grow and went into twenty thirty five are cultures of going to change a lot as the the baby boomers get older or there will be a lot more seniors our culture will be primarily people over sixty\nThey're less and less younger people staying around and also people are having less children so\nUm our culture is going to need to adapt to\nAll the changing needs and deal with you know holes in systems in terms of transportation and home care there are a lot more caregivers families who are raising kids who are also taking care of their older parents so I think there are a lot of needs that\nAre families have not just seniors but also families as a whole need support and isolation is really a detrimental thing so being involved at the senior center can really offset a whole families need to care for its older family members\nMarie ... the director of senior services at the senior center on ... street in North Hampton seven forty four right now coming in and just a few minutes Carl Marx\nIt was at the

write it\nAn extraordinary work of scholarship among other things how long did it take you to write it\nTook me about six years or six or eight years of charging people down and are trying to get the story straight for the first time\nAnd I take it that the purpose of the book was to try to write the definitive biography Ronald Reagan signed\nA letter you know they're ... they're been so many of them just like when I wrote the Beatles there have been almost eight hundred beetles books before mine but I felt that they were either ... or or swimming you know books about a particular part of their career\nAnd then Reagan's case there were you know there were either policy walks or a books that were a really part is and I really felt he needed a complete definitive biography that\nWeren't from his his early childhood and took them through you know the entire twentieth century I mean his wife framed the twentieth century\n... I'd like to do if you don't mind is read to you that your book authors kind of like hearing their words so I thought I'd say there and but I have a series of questions I'd like to ask you so I'm going to actually go through some periods of time you write about one is early Nineteen fifties and you say about Ronald Reagan\nQuote the Supreme Court had heard a case\nBrown versus board of education that threatened up and how Americans send their children to school and I stopped there for a second what kind of reaction is that to brown versus the board of education which said that\nSeparate but equal was not equal there was no a quality to segregation and Ronald Reagan was worried about whether the white people have the choice of sending their kids to all white school is that what that was about\nA well you know he did in a way and uh it it was a real paradox of Reagan's wife Reagan was violently opposed desegregation from the time he was a young kid or all the way through his wife and and yet you know he he had such conservative leaning that he often did not\nA kind of understand how policy affected real Americans and I'm ... and I I think he came down on the wrong side of that issue\n[noise] let me ask you this moving from the early fifties to the late fifties you write this and more and more when Ronald Reagan spoke and this goes I think to his having become the star and spokesperson for General Electric GE theater which really was what made him a household figure in America\nMore and more whenever Ronald Reagan spoke his remarks dug deep in the anxiety into the anxieties of the heartland a litany of grievances poured out of him the wrong headed goal of government paid medicine excessive Social Security contributions close Social Security is coming to the end of the road\nWell I'll tell you what though if you listened very quietly you can hear Ronald Reagan turning over in his grave block\nRonald Reagan was not a Ronald Reagan was a unifier not a divider he never disparage people's walks he never questioned their patriotism and you know he didn't call women names\nUm the the saving grace of Ronald Reagan was that he was a very humble guy who who really respected other people's opinions and that's why I think that not only Republicans but guys like Obama quote him and Bill Clinton\nQuoted him you know they they tried to hang on to that really decent part of Ronald Reagan or that are really is a mirror to what's going on in in Washington today\nWe lived there we've been speaking with Bob spits his new book is Reagan and American journey

wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip search trays that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six\nAnd make a home much more robust\nIn the case in Florida we we live part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock in it\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound and all that has to be done is it supposed out there is no issue with mold\nAnd so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding from\nPopulation growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that and much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood plumbing error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it's just rethinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount Soto incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust\nMake it safer and eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat were property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild again\nOn and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf is with us on the Clark Howard show ... Ralph\nHello cart thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely how you doing\nI'm doing great we uh recently moved back for a living\nOverseas for many years and he appreciated oldest say that you have to say to make out of the integration little cheesy area because so many things have changed and very grateful to put all your life to give it a ... thanks for that\nWill give it a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nA first lifted the u._k. for about five years studying Switzerland for ... for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now no kids so [laughter] how about you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well three fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic and I speak English and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom\nWell see that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink and wine and then you could go\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] um one\nThing I'm curious about after all those years away did you have a hard time re establishing a credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that where he those areas difficult for you when you re integrated value in the U.S\nNo because we we have an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside a plan to on a lake that we kept so we have from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years well how can I be of service to you today\nWell the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial as you have a ... and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account for the way that I can use social Jews and access to ... to get them going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer using chrome book for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail\nOh for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail\nWith the Google accounts when you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having that separate Gmail\nIs the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\nAh I don't know my life for this for me from my end or service\nWill happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\nI'm sure she did that go she listens to you too of course a verb\nSo with the ... the whole idea of a crime book where Ralf and I are talking about is they are ... inexpensive right now routinely available to a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinds of things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so chrome books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um insurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers\nAnd having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out at your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for

[noise]\nAnd coming up yeah later [noise]\nI've got a new technique yet another one for you to use when you love to travel and you just want to know what deals there are so let's talk about you ripping yourself off\nThere's a new study that's been published by Deloitte\nBig guy consulting outfit and they found that people doing four O. one K. loans decimate\nYour future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do a loan from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been hey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nThan they are going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from a four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people\nWill do four one K. loans but the thing is when you do that those loans dramatically reduce how much money you have down the road and in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings\nFrom that four one K. loan that's even when you pay the loans back and you may wonder how could that be well there's a two for here when you borrow from a four O. one K. you have to pay back the plan right and so\nBecause they're your initial it you were eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if he can bring out of the faithful and that's what ...\nUh and how much commission like if you got me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth of this this electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission\nI get a ten percent\nSo he's got Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets a hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nIn the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust in that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOkay how would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there's no true product or service that's being sold\nIf it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously end up being an illegal pyramid\nIn illegal game of chance so\nUnless you are somebody who really loves the whole idea of gambling do you love to gamble\n[laughter] [laughter] I Do a little bit\nYeah we didn't go to Vegas taken a show enjoy all the glitz and the lights and all that but don't get involved in something that may well turn out to be an illegal pyramid a Ponzi

want to talk about transportation what are you thinking of doing\nYes we do okay my wife and I are retired couple era relieving split in central Florida\nAnd we've been on a few crew is is that now that we're retired down here in Florida we plan on going on a cruise but also uh we'd like to uh find out what sites are available for people that live down here because we're retired we can go on like short notice a few days notice if there are\nAre good deals\nThat you can get on a you know last minute cruises\nAre definitely okay so there there are some in particular that people who have that flexibility use and one that's very popular with people who do that is one called cruise credit\nAnd when you get to the main page there's a deal section and the most popular part of the deal section is last minute cruises and to cruise lines can dump\nTheir unsold inventory on ships at the very last minute and you'll find that if you can be opportunistic like that and fire crews at the very last instant\nThat that's a great way for you to do it also have you ever been to the website cruise compete\nDot com [noise] no I haven't\nSaid Cruz compete you can put what you're interested in doing and cruise only agencies literally compete for your business\nAnd so many times they may be willing to give up some of their commissions um you know in order to be able to sell you at a lower price\nOkay that sounds pretty you know you talk like last minute you said on the website there are they talking a few days or like a\nA generally with the ... last minute is less than three weeks before sailing\nOr less ... less than three weeks\nYou think about most people that are buying a cruise they're not like you they're not living gosh if you're in central Florida\nYou're fifty minutes or so from Port Canaveral which I think is the biggest us crews sport now there's a lot of ships sail out of Tampa that are like probably Ninety minutes from you and people in South Florida\nUs crews for it now there's a lot of ships sail out of Tampa that are like probably Ninety minutes from you and people in South Florida Miami Fort Lauderdale across the Everglades\nIn Naples Marco Island they do these last minute deals and so it's very common practice for Floridians to do these last minute bookings 'cause you don't need air but most people\nAre living who knows where in the United states or even in Canada or overseas or whatever and they've got to make advanced plants so once you cross that Twenty one day period that's when you see so many of the deals\nOkay very good and the most of the large cruise lines they participate in her\nOr him not necessarily it varies I'm looking right now on what's available on the thing I was talking about they're showing a lot of cruises that are just in the next couple of days that\nThere are real deals on to those that are about yeah about three weeks out their great deals on and they show you how much a percent discount there at but I don't ever believed discount\nFrom a cruise line I only care about what the prices and comparing the price from one vendor to another\nOkay very good well I appreciate your help a lot\nCloser and have a great time and remember always join whatever frequent guest program there is for each cruise line and you go on because you accumulate enough points which you can easily do living in Florida now\nThat you start getting all kinds of benefits like uh maybe if you like to drink free liquor on board don't do that for you fly um anything that makes it a better experience like free cabin upgrades those kinds of things are available as you accumulate points\nOn particular cruise lines\nKelly's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kelly how are you\nHi ... I'm great how are you\nI Am having a wonderful day thank you what's going on Kelly\nWell my husband and I are finally getting around to setting up a will and living trashed and special needs as being too special needs kids actually yellow adults and we have no idea how much to put into special needs for\nThe amount of money potentially to set aside could be quite large and if they are young adults I gosh I don't know the sensitive way to ask this question so I'm just going to\nNeed to ask gays okay I Know what you're going to\nSay they're potential to Liz can be a hundred years old [laughter]\nHow did you know that was what was going to as he has\nA lawyer asked that same day so he said I don't know how to ask this fellow\nPay I I should've just fit that in there before you even had to ask [laughter] okay so we need to\nBe prepared that a you know could live you know\nAll right well a long time what people normally do is the first thing you do is for each of the kids you establish a five twenty nine able if you're familiar with five twenty nine ... if you saw a lawyer a it was probably explain to you\nAnd ... ... now I don't remember\nWhat ... what a five twenty nine able is is it's an account where you're able to put money in for each of their children the gross tax free and spin on their needs is spent tax free\nOkay so the first money you put aside for a disabled child should always going to enable\nOkay and they vary in cost or because they're sponsored by states in some states have very very low costs tables and others have more expensive ones it's almost like a cousin of the five twenty nine college savings plans I'll talk about\nOkay the best briefing available in the country on buying a naval is it's saving for college dot com okay\nAnd I know this isn't about college but they've done a very nice job breaking out the the cost for the able accounts\nOkay so if you go there you'll be able to see is a very simple chart you'll be able to see how the plan works\nAnd I want to congratulate the people saving for college dot com for doing such a nice job on that but that would allow you to put aside didn't answer your question how much money should you have instead I jumped right to this is the most efficient place for you to start putting money\nAs far as how you'd find in overall need for a lifespan that might be another potentially Seventy or eighty years\nTerm life insurance is almost certainly the best choice with the money going into a trust for the benefit of each child to separate trust\nTo go into a a living trashed\nUm well it would be if it's going to be for life insurance the warrior you've talked to will tell you exactly what kind of trust you want it structured into\nOkay and you have some meaningful expense and drawing up the trust that the life insurance would find okay but because\nThe the financial need if you were to die much younger than normal and you have a larger number of years that the kids have to be taken care of you need to have a hefty term life insurance policy\nOkay how is your house or perfect so\nPerfect does a great opportunity and I hate to ask another impolite question how old are you\nI'm fifty two\nRight so you would probably look at a twenty year level term policy okay that means that you are guaranteed that policy for the next Twenty years\nAnd that it would provide a benefit for that time now the question comes what happens after that time right so\nFor all of them [noise] learn more and sign up at hot chocolate ... dot com [noise]\nYou may know taking humane society is a great place to adopt a pet but we are so much more for animals and the people who love them or community clinic has new England's largest they knew their provider\nEach week we hold a vaccine a microchip clinic with affordable these we operate a pet food bank in conjunction with our community partners so no member of your family goes hungry our website has information about these services and more\nYou'd like to support animals and need places that they can you may not work they depend on us and we depend on you\nWHM you reveal somebody you are as I age they do Turner's false W.

to you\nWell I I yeah I I sell things on E. bay I also like and I bought a um an part case for my daughter last week for Ninety One sense\nWith free shipping and it came from China [noise]\nAnd I [laughter]\nNow now remember this tape out fees there's ... shipping fees and plus\nThe product now you know Ninety One sense would free shipping and I was able to track it right to my door till it said delivered\nIt went from China to Chicago to Orlando to or to Florida where I live than it stood out for delivery and deliver it to the end it showed delivered I Can't even male first class letter to China for\nLess than three dollars and twelve cents now for me to sell on E. bay I'd have to provide tracking ... recall formation might shape is service for me to send to China would forty six dollars and he says\nIt has to be said with a minimum of priority mail express\nTrying to get a tracking number with proof of delivery\nAnd and I just find it it's impossible to compete with that and\nWhat what's impossible is for that kind of thing to continue I buy a cell phone accessories on E. bay and even if they don't come from China they seem to be almost a hundred percent made there\nAnd the price points make no sense at all I mean I'm I'm with you why would somebody sell your daughter a case\nFor under a buck that even if they make it for a nickel by the time ... and all the shipping costs their negative several dollars\nThat even if they make it for a nickel by the time ... and all the shipping costs their negative several dollars\nYou can even if I sell in America and I ship it in America might cheapest service that I could use print thing with the discount through e bay as a top rated seller is a dollar Ninety three for first class or liberal reconfirmation so my ... my cheapest way to ship something in America is a ... right\nRight so where the normal business Bobby the explanation for that would be but it's a loss leader to get you in the door of a store either online or a physical store than buy other things that higher prices but the disjointed marketplace of e bay\nGenerally doesn't support that so I'm I'm as mystified by this as you are\nThe only thing I could think of is that our government service let's try to use our thing for free\nThey don't they don't and so the seller lost money I don't care a lot of ... I don't care if you call it the people's money I don't care if you call up the U.S dollar they lost money and whatever currency you counted that\nWow it just it makes no sense\nYou know self I'll give you another example you know I was talking about how we're getting all these less expensive cell phones and some of them coming to the United states or from Chinese companies and I noticed something on E. bay that I Can't place my finger on either that you can go buy\nA one of these phones from a Chinese seller have it shipped all the way over here and buy it for at least a third less\nThan it cost if you buy it from an American retailer that cells that Chinese branded phone\nIn a retail store on line\nSo it will hold when my appetite why Asian\nGuy I Can't compete with what's going on from China just write shipping alone I Can't compete\nBut but the thing is it's not sustainable it's not sustainable and it's not gonna last so people want to sell us good below their cost I Know that it's called\nSomething but I Am in favor a dumb thing because if they want to lose money to support us let them go for it but I'd much rather lob cellphone cases at a loss at us instead of nuclear missiles

eh birthday next year and I was wondering if there is any way I could the research for him at vacation in Antarctica I could afford on our library and budget hey that big nature of our so I just wanted to surprise him with some from life\nWell are you just the sweetest you're not going to go\nNow okay so\nI have not Antarctica is the only continent I haven't gone to\nNormally you think it's because I haven't gone because I'm cheap and I won't spend the money that's half the answer the other half\nBecause I haven't gone because I'm cheap and I won't spend the money that's half the answer the other half is if you watch any videos on YouTube about\nWhat the waves are like is you go south most people go south from Argentina\nThe waves are dry a monster waves most of the time when it comes as you get closer to Antarctica and so do you think your husband could handle going through her\nWho ran and got a lot by God and I understand the way it is that where rather unpleasant that as well\nOkay so good for him I'm not doing that though she knocked me out for like two days and I woke up and I had known had been through him so the the reality is going to Antarctica is going to be an expensive venture\nMhm and there are no\nTrue bargain trips that I have ever heard of to in order to ... something that has to be a very very special event that's worth laying out some serious cash\nThat's not the answer you were looking for for me was that\nWell I looked at the Monterey maybe if they have in the air or if they are and they live blended specialists\n[laughter] okay so if I go to Antarctica do you get there from there\nYou go to Antarctica during the um north northern hemisphere winner mhm because it will be summer so you really want to go in um December January February\nAnd Antarctica is I'm a generally you go on a boat and uh\nUsed to be um like discovery fights that people would go on where you just fly down and you'd fly over the uh Antarctica and then you fly back and it's\nThat something that I'm not aware is done any more because it just doesn't give you the experience you have if you go by boat many of the boats that go are for scientific research but there are journeys for people who just want to experience the adventure\nAnd I'm trying to think where\nYou know what okay\nKrista my producer just came up with something on the Web that did not occur to me you're going to like this where she just came up with\nThere are a when they have ... sold burst on the cruises to Antarctica they offer deals on them just like they do for any other crews for last minute unsold cabins\nWow I Would have never thought of that that's why she's my boss she's got that brain power that so that is the right thing to do is to look for the last minute cruise what month are you thinking of him going\nLike football he can and go hey he can go any any any time next year\nOkay whatever so it was what I ... what I Do is I Would\nI Would I talk to someone who is a cruise only agent and get he or she to to keep monitoring it and when there's a real special for one opens up particularly for a last minute that that's how you book at and that's how he goes\nOut of Africa\nAnd you have to add in the cost is most of them as I mentioned go from Argentina huh so you have to add in the cost of the flight from wherever in the U.S to Argentina not to Buenos Aires to ah to [noise]\nI Would probably is frequent flyer miles that's what they did find that they're ...\nVery smart very smart that combination mugged there would be a great deal use a free ticket and then a last minute crews and he will ever experienced the only continent I have not been too and maybe I Need to stop being such a wimp\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nHey good a landfill lashed out here today\nWas great to have you here you have a question for me about it how I get a raise or don't last so long that right [laughter]\nYou mentioned drying blade well I Can't figure out how to do that\nWell I don't do the right way\nRobert what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use like um\nAlcohol to dry it or some people that are obsessed use a blow dryer there are now devices you can buy at drug stores that when you're done shaving you put the blade into it and then it's basically an internal hair dryer kind of thing\nThat ... that drives the blade I simply a dry it on my child shake it off dry it on my child put it in the drawer\nAnd two blades ago my blade lasted Fifteen months my most recent blade I Am sad to report only lasted three months\n[laughter] [laughter] I don't know what I did wrong 'cause that's the shortest any blade is lasted me in years and years and years but I only got three months out of\nThe list is pretty impressive when I like that alcohol I did I think I'll do it that way [laughter]\nSo how often do you replace the blade Robert\nOh well [noise] ah Italy shave about twice a week and I can probably go a month old ...\nWell now if you start drying it you'll make it a is a twice a week shaver you might make it two years\nWhere we will see a lot of it I'm going to take up the challenge\nAll right let's see the longest 'cause I was impressed with my Fifteen months but there are people who have gone way past Fifteen getting as a a raise or to last because the key is that blades don't deteriorate from the active shaving\nThey deteriorate only from moisture the manufacturers that chicken Gillette\nAnd the other smaller players make fantastic razors now\nAnd there's no reason for him to degrade

thanks so much this is an extraordinary work of scholarship among other things how long did it take you to write it\nTook me about six years or six or eight years of charging people down and are trying to get the story straight for the first time\nAnd I take it that the purpose of the book really was to try to write the definitive biography Ronald Reagan right\nElana you know the ... there have been so many of them just like when I wrote the Beatles there have been almost eight hundred beetles books before mine but I felt that they were either ... or or swim in you know books about a particular part of their career\nAnd then Reagan's case there were you know there were either policy walks or a books that were a really part is and I really felt he needed a complete definitive biography that\nWent from his his early childhood and took him through you know the entire twentieth century I mean there's a white framed the twentieth century\nWhat I'd like to do if you don't mind is read to you the best of your book authors kind of like during their words so I thought I'd say I was there and but I have a series of questions I'd like to ask you so I'm going to actually go through some periods of time you write about one is early Nineteen fifties and you say about Ronald Reagan\nQuote the Supreme Court had heard a case\nBrown versus board of education that threatened up and how Americans send their children to school ... let me stop there for a second what kind of reaction is that their brand versus the board of education which said that\nSeparate but equal was not equal there was no a quality to segregation and Ronald Reagan was worried about what the white people have the choice of sending their kids to all white school is that what that was about\nA world you know he did in a way and ah it was a real paradox of Reagan's\nWife Reagan was violently opposed desegregation from the time he was a young kid a all the way through his wife\nAnd and yet you know he he had such conservative leaning that he often did not a kind of understand how policy affected real Americans and I'm ... and I think he came down on the wrong side of that issue\nLet me ask you this movie from the early fifties to the late fifties you write this and more and more when Ronald Reagan spoke and this goes I think to is having become the store and spokesperson for General Electric gee theater which really was what made him a household figure in America\nMore and more whenever Ronald Reagan spoke his remarks dug deep in the anxiety into the anxieties of the heartland Whitney of grievances poured out of him the wrong headed goal of government paid medicine excessive Social Security contributions quote Social Security is coming to the end of the road\nWell I'll tell you what though if you listen very quiet way you can hear Ronald Reagan turning over in his grave look\nRonald Reagan was not a Ronald Reagan was a unifier not a divider he never disparage people's walks he never questioned the patriotism and you know he didn't call women names\nUm they're just saving grace of Ronald Reagan was that he was a very humble guy who who really respected other people's opinions and that's why I think that not only Republicans but guys like Obama quote him and Bill Clinton\nQuote him you know they they tried to hang on to that really decent part of Ronald Reagan or that are really is a mirror to what's going on in a in Washington today\nWe leave it there we've been speaking with Bob spits his new book is Reagan and American journey thank you very much for your
