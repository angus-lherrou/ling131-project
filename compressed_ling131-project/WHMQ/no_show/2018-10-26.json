following Kavanaugh seemed to have profoundly change the outlook for the Republican Party in the Senate I'm looking at Texas Arizona Nevada Michigan Missouri\nAll of a sudden it tumbles out that the Republicans are in command of this do you believe that would have always happened or is this a consequence of the Democratic aggression with Kavanaugh and the consequences of the Democrats unwillingness unwillingness to resolve immigration how do you measure it\nReading a I think the most effective barometer today is is not the polls that is social media and reading a social media I think the lion's share of the explanation\nMust be put a the feet of the Democrats have your drink capital of the the shift measurable with the general sentiment away from the Democrats in towards the president Republicans was almost instantaneous off to the treatment that he was given at the hands of the Democrats senators so yes I think it is\nThe last three weeks that up to the tide measurably\nThe Kavanaugh hearings and not resolved yet we have news that Senator Grassley has made a criminal invest a criminal recommendations or to the pocket of justice about the behavior of one

that sentiment but kept up during the recent reports of these ... seem to be political intimidation will like counter that wave towards the Republican it's too early to tell to its though we have to know the perpetrators off\nOr the house representatives there and is the low bar that the Democrats set for themselves because political science says that the party out of power gain seats and an

Illinois in California in the districts where the the tide will go one way or the author\nSo given all that given that we can have good numbers at this point I it sounds to me like nobody's confident

F. that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department administers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swept under subpoena that can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this with and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swept previously under the previous round of sanctions\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting max but but on the issue of the rainy and ... of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that that they did last time whether it's by facts or email you know we're anyway just to to signal that they want to move funds who care to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November fifth are probably\nGoing to do so regardless of whether or not Iran is on the program to city oh go ahead no no I I I don't want us\nTo run out of time and we did not ask you about the efficacy of the sanctions so far no\nShe was she did address that in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies should have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge the effort to see the first run of ... to successful and really impacting the target you saw\nI think that's a really important question and we as we approach November effect because I've I think one of the thing to remember is that there where each to Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty day wind down periods or what that meant is that business has had that period to to to complete any business that had been allowed that they were doing\nAnd that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and end with drill and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic of yet but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure\nUm that that's going to be brought to bear through all the first\nYeah the sanctions that went back in place um August ... well before then just that you're going to you you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a ads of November fifth ah because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea of sanctions snap back within which was written into the Jaycee pie away perhaps not foreseen and that's the way up but most terms that that that would have ... gauge would have had plans on the shelf to put in place to to quickly wind down to business\nCatherine Bauer Cape hours the bloom and Stein ... family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy she's a former treasury official she serves and departments financial Tasha in Jerusalem and in the Gulf Malcolm home line conference a president's major American Jewish organization I'm John ...

committee and it doesn't mean we never had a different differences of opinion but we did it respectfully and we were able to always compromise so we were able to come out I remember there was one sanctions bill during the December twenty Thirteen\nAnd we passed unanimously out of the foreign affairs committee or that people like Tea Party people from the ... from the right all the way to uh extreme of a progressive\nOr on the on the left and everybody voted for it and then we did it because we handed out and we we we we moved to head and we talked a lot about Israel in the United states and I'm going to keep doing it I I Know there's going to be some some difficulty but I'm I'm ready for the challenge and I have a lot to say I've been working this issue for a long time and\nI look forward to sitting down with all of my colleagues and trying to help convince them that Israel is the best friend we have email\nA it is true that you are very very and very likely to be the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee if your party is successful in the mid term but I'm not certain that that's doing anybody a favor you're going to inherit Syria\nWith Russia turkey and the Assad mercenaries ringing it lip Providence and I'm told that that can turn extremely violent we also have American troops in Syria greatly at risk because the Iranians want that highway to Haiti's\nFrom

the backing of Iran with the backing of Russia um ... it's just something that just just has got to break your heart from a from a human a point of view and\nI'm ... we're not done obviously there's still there's so many many difficulties with the with Syria and many many difficulties that's why it's important I think for the United states to continue to ah to talk to all sides and uh to to have a working relationships with ah with country\nOne more detail ... one more detailed Eliot the American embassy is now in Jerusalem does that make it easier to deal with the Palestinians your measure\n[noise] well to tell you the truth is John I don't think it ... makes it easier or or harder um we we passed a law uh I Wish I voted for twenty three years ago a which ask that the embassy be\nTo Jerusalem and there was a waiver in this and every president since then use the waiver I'm and I'm President Trump and I have many disagreements with him but President Trump to his credit\nI'm signed it to a signed the move and didn't use the waiver and I think when Congress shows a and then the intent or to go in a certain direction I just don't think it should be disregarded and these were bipartisan it was it was here for several years\nAnd um I I I think that it's where it belongs now if the Palestinians and the leadership really wants peace\nIt it shouldn't have any effect on it um [noise] you need to just sit down you can't have have an agreement if people won't even come to a to the negotiating table and whatever one thinks of\nA two state solution and I still favor two state solution\nUm the the fact of the matter is that doing all these negotiations since Oslo\nUh Israel was ready on two occasions to sign a peace treaty with the Palestinians one day I could but

is\nCan you give us a quick assessment ... chairman of the western hemisphere do you think South America relations will improve that we can counter the Iranian going influence there thirty seconds of

there's a lot that we can do\nAnd we should do it when we were last in the majority I was chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee and we made a lot of strides in in in making the relationship

vice president of China visiting Israel to whatever\nIs a I think a very interesting story because it's kind of thing that gets very little attention but I think long term has great significance\nBecause for for a number of years there's been a an organization to Israel China joint committee on commission on innovation\nAnd cooperation and that this is a body that meet annually and what's under the guidance of a very high ranking Chinese official but the government of trying to clearly\nHas upgraded this and designated a vice president who's I think number eight in the hierarchy to come a Wang ... a a cool and I think is his name and that so they said a very significant player very close to the present Jean and he came and visited and publicly\nAppeared with the prime minister and that they opened a conference at the Paris center main for the late president of Israel Shimon Peres\nWho appeared in a hologram engaged a spiritual will because as you know he was always the one talking about nano technology and\nAll sorts of a dictionary or have used for Israel and seeing Israel as technological has been in it strengthened even Jack Ma what's there many others came\nA but the relationship with China to Israel despite the fact that on the run and other things are tensions and the investment in the nineties it was fifty million dollars Chinese investment in Israel in sixteen\nThe things are tensions and the investment in the nineties it was fifty million dollars Chinese investment in Israel in sixteen in in twenty sixteen it was a sixteen and a half billion dollars\nAnd so the trade it is growing a all the time the trade with the Arab world is like a hundred and Seventy one billion but the differences that that's mostly sale of consumer goods lower and good with Israel it's high tech its I teach a and you know there are restrictions because Israel ... doesn't sell military technology\nBut health care and and uh other things that that can be beneficial sustainable development and thinks that the that China really needs and they find the news where they bought a dairy from Israel because they found out that the cows give more milk and they they are now working cooperatively in many areas\nAnd it's the same time they still have a relationship with the Palestinians they vote in the un with them um but no longer have the pressure of you know that the Arab states are demanding that says condition or or um\n... in any way restrict the access to Israel so that since I think reflective of a bigger change that doesn't get noted but I think long term you know a hundred and fifty thousand Chinese visited Israel this year you know when you were there we saw the delegations every other\nUh if I read in the economist okay Hi that's my that's my duty to read the economists look at America from mother Britten write a reading the economists that there is fresh concern in Israel\nAbout Chinese espionage just about Chinese or interference in\nIntellectual property because there's rail is start up nation there's even a building that the Chinese workers are working on and Tel Aviv that is part of the national security apparatus and there's concern there as well\nMalcolm it's not an idle concern the economists said that the prime minister is freshly moving on this so while there's investment dollars and\nJak laws present a related impossible to ignore the fact that if you were going to choose a country that gave you access to American technology he would choose Israel because of the relationship between the two countries I think\nYou're right on all counts and and the concern is there it's it's actually universal true in most other countries because the Chinese have a record in that regard I I Do think that there are those who are trying to counter it in established a different platform I met with\nChinese business people who who are very interested in coming because you're working with Israel the building tourism to Israel and from Israel but there is a universal concern that that technology has often been stolen from American companies as well and because that's what Israel has its main export yeah it is is that\nRight well I had as as if the knowledge economy knowledge base it correctly and and the Chinese agents of the Communist Party are bad actors when it comes to my knowledge economy right\nSo so those restrictions and that is why they don't deal in the ... in the military technology areas in have restrictions on it except things that can be used for\nAll right I'm not I'm not the prosecutor I'm repeating what I read in the economist perhaps I misunderstood don't know if it's true let's go to ... let's go to China because there's such a bank and China that is closed its doors I think they even caught the fingers of an Iranian agent trying to get into the door as it is I think at the end\nThey slammed the door and it's habit what is this may laugh and well I think it's part of\nOur ongoing effort to get people to understand how the sanctions are working in an even in the countries that we are least likely to to adhere to it we see that the Chinese ships now are are at least a turning off their trade sponsors as well but some of them will not carry Iranian oil\nAnd the and other countries as well but now we see a key Chinese bank and it it it's the bank of ... but it's it's very important because it's controlled\nBy the state ... energy groups PC and they they uh had stopped euros denominated transactions with Iran a while ago but now they stop US Currency\nAh this is a a really important indication\nThat the uh sanctions and what's coming up and to remember Ford that we discussed earlier this evening\nI'm at with cats from power and others\nIs really a even in advance of of the application\nI'm already affecting so many companies and so many banks insurance shipping others who take this seriously and and the predictions that I saw from she ... the assistant secretary of treasury under secretary of treasury who's in charge of this of the sanctions\nUm that they are a seriously applying it you know the treasury has this office\nOn terror finance they have seven hundred professionals they're tracking capital\nAnd tangible assets and the transfer ability a bill of ... of these assets to keeping track to make sure\nThat the terrorists in Iran don't benefit from the sale and and profits from these things and this move by a Chinese Man can of others follow is increasingly turning the news on the options open to Iran\nTo avoid the sanctions quickly we have less than a minute the last time you mentioned that there was a ... in a rupture and and a disruption between Jordan in Israel over a long standing peace deal\nRight the

that were identified as where the one of the unknown so one of the four unknown soldiers comes from I'm going to begin with a man named Janson he has a gun or a sergeant United States Marines born in Eighteen Seventy eight this is Patrick very careful reporting so he's forty years old\nHe's a member of the forty nine they're very early into the war they arrive in June of Nineteen Seventeen to train\nBut it ... it is now the summer of Nineteen Eighteen this is an event that you've heard about on the on the edges of history class called Bello would Patrick take us into Bello would in June of Nineteen eight\nJune of Nineteen Eighteen the French Army is melting away as the the the um\nThe example that they use is that it's like rain on a hot hot iron it just evaporates in the ... the French Army as evaporating it in front of a massive German offensive that is directed it directly at Paris and lived in dark\nMeans to win the war right now\nYes and the only units that are you know in ready reserve and that are willing to fight\n'em is or the American the second and the third infantry wretch a division specifically\nThe second which includes the force brigade which is a marine Corp brigade and the the Marines are are shifted into Bello would or in in that sector they dig in behind the fleeing French and this is a very important fact\nThe French were just taking whatever forces that they had in immediately throwing them into battle but the the commander of the the second insisted that the chief of staff insisted that we dig in behind and not be thrown in piecemeal and this potentially was a war saving maneuver\nThis is general ... systems she'd been arguing the politics of this for some time because the British commander hay and the French commander ... wanted to cut up the Americans and feed them into the weak divisions that were holding the line against the Germans that summer and Pershing had refused\nThis is part of that that's part of the macro but on the very tactical level the chief of staff of the second division a colonel brown insisted that we dig in behind the French and we form a a defensive line\nAnd this was a very important move the um the the the Marines dig in\nAnd I mean this is where through accurate rifle fire they stop\nIn many cases advancing Germans through the weak field and I mean this is a situation where the the Marines are seeing the French we all around them the the army and the French as they move into the area they the the French say the war is over [noise]\nExcuse me and and they ah they dig in behind the French and there's you know some famous lines here a retreat hell we just got here\nIs uttered by one of the marine officers who help stop I'm part of the German advance\nHit it out June sex and the Marines are going to go on the offensive against that lowered the Germans now have the superior defensive position everyone in the first war\nKnew that the defenders had an advantage because of the machine guns and because of the heavy artillery that was very carefully targeted on the front lines the Marines go forward including government sergeant Ernest Johnson into a massacre with becomes a massacre they\nThey advance in a line or through what is called a weak field open ground and the Germans mow them down but the Marines don't stop\nThey don't stop they keep pushing forward\nAnd their objective is a is known as hill one forty two it's a crucial high ground outside of Belo would and they they push on um the forty nine company in particular is leading the attack a Jansen\nAnd I'm George Hamilton who is just the captain of the forty night the the unknowns covers this band of brothers the forty nine through the entire book it's the through line in many cases\nRight this is a moment in an American military history where they were not separating the Marines from the army so they were all blended together into one fighting unit but this particular unit was entirely Marine Corps\nThat's correct and they're moving forward through the wheat and they take the hill against all odds the hill is actually occupied by in a battalion of Germans but they overcome the hill unit\nIn there it's a rise from all would the would look today what it looked like in Nineteen eighty\nIt has similar there's the wheat fields very bucolic but at the same time the scars of war very present there's\nThere's massive shovels that that literally could swallow a small house with there's a some of the trees are still embedded with the mustard gas shells that it's been um hurled around during the war first world war\nForty ninth overruns one forty two realizes that rise behind this is our position so they fall into one forty two and now comes Johnson's roll the Germans got around behind one forty to how how does it work that he all of a sudden faces more than a dozen German\nState they immediately um fall back on to one forty two after they realized that they've gone a little bit too far and they brace for counter attack that's typical German tactics within a half\nAn hour the Germans immediately will counterattack position that they just lost in the hope of of regaining it and that's what came that there are two they're literally potato mash or grenades and artillery that reigned in and the Germans counter attacked in great strength\nUm with ... and they started to set up the nearly were over running the hill and Jansen spiders several camouflage helmets which were the ... a German helmets\nAnd ... that were represented by German machine gun or is that we're setting up their their maxims\nAnd have they been able to set up they would have probably over on the hill with a fighting fire but chance and saw them and immediately sprung the action and literally let a band that charge by himself and disrupted the these maxim machine guns is rooted in the process\nAnother ... we need to mention quickly this is a ... a man by the name of del who's field artillery color sergeant James Dow us you know as the army field artillery he was decorated for ... sauce once a month later now it's middle of July Nineteen Eighteen\nHe fires the French artillery piece the Seventy five a and this battle ... sauce was also that they call it the second battle of Martin I Believe this was also a nightmare of casualties for the American\nAgain with the Americans after advance across open fields they face a heavy machine gun fire\nBut they're going on the counter offensive and they're literally on engineering or the Germans salient that had been created in in July or I mean is our in June in may when they were thrusting towards Paris\nAnd this forces the Germans to fall back to their their initial positions of the hidden in Britain language or these prepared fences\nDell's and his unit are decorate it decorated for constantly\nThe ... of the Indian Berg language or these prepared fences\nDell's and his unit or ... is decorated for constantly being at risk field artillery pieces don't have a big range so they're ... they're within the range of the big German got this is\nYou know I mean a hidden part of World War one history I think the

take I can say these weird things do they mean something they they that I can say I saw the red Sox play during this season you know so that makes me happy\nHe won the game to where we are beautiful seats given to us um my oldest boy who hates baseball or he was a kid the father of a kid the coach basketball says are you a baseball fan because now you have all I got four really nice sheets here right behind home plate yeah\nOh wait a minute he says I bet I know who could use that I\nThat I Know they call when you are hitting ... seats and I've done that um it it's it's special they see in my seat sucked I'm knocking on [laughter] I was at Fenway Park now it's always a magical experience\nI have a a a policy um you can give me she said I'll take them for free or whatever but even for free I Will not sit past section eight that's as far as I Will go\nOn the right field side on the left field side you can go all the way out to section thirty three go all the way out to the green monster and you still have great sight lines you can still see\nThe other side is way too far and of course I of vision anyway I could never sit in the bleachers I Can't sit in section one two three four five\nSix liters or seats and not a matter of fact I Can't I Can't\nEven see and also when you're that far out and you see the ball hit the bat but you know you don't\nHear the ball hit the ... seconds later you know you're on another planet are out there you don't know but anyway yeah either that part yeah I Do any place\nI don't think I have that is in the on the green monster at that set a goal of mine\nAre likely to that and as I say that is a a that's a pretty good seat you can still you're still close enough the action if you take the the last section there right next to a degree monster\nAnd then you draw a line to the other side you end up the section eight so that's about where your sight lines and anything beyond section eight that I don't even take them for free so and and\nThen you can send them I have I have a sense of ... at Fenway Park we've got a mommy and I've done I mean uh uh but that isn't David Ortiz\nFine watching him and how much he loves this team yeah not so much fun to watch\nI saw him play in in Santo Domingo and when we went to the Dominican Republic and we just had a cabdriver tickets to a ball game and it was a ball game that featured a lot of a major leaguers that you would recognize and David Ortiz play first base for one of the team\nYeah he's been he's been fun to watch many even now post post playing you know fun to watch him watching this team you know and to see his love for this team\nHe's amazing and ah you know it's it's a it's funny when you I'm Talking about the old days and we talk about your strength ski just mentioned a minute ago and that that clip and Ted Williams and all these guys they always looked like they weren't having a good time and that's one of the this team really change when they brought Pedro Martinez in David Ortiz\nEnd of this thing and they go through the whole thing changed dramatically mhm and wait a minute this is supposed to be fun yeah that's a stressful yes it's stressful and yes the fans are more ... and just the sports writers are more honest but still it's a fun fun game\nThey have like your strength keep got bogged down in ... and he was always nervous and fidgety in in grumpy because of the sports writers and Ted Williams hated everybody so a ... in that era that long\nTrain rise they were drinking all the time was a different ... and now looks like they're having\nFun you see a movie that's out there at a candy and their their little dance that they do in the outfield and there are out there that smiles on these guys they're they're fun to watch the make it fun to lot\nYeah so I'm a this was game three of the world series it it almost seems impossible we're so used to it now I guess that the red Sox contend for the championship every year\nYeah here's your they're they're right there there are in there\nSo every year that you know they've got the team that did this team you can do no wrong but this game three night or the great contrast between the two parts you've got the oldest Martin in the world\nThat was kind of stuff and crammed into this little downtown section you know there's no there's not a of an inch of real estate around it as did just drop right in there and then you've got a wide open spaces of\nOf ah Chavez Ravine where the Dodgers stadium is which I've I've actually seen a game there and you've got the palm trees and all that it's a whole different experience than than what you have and and you ... you have parking you have these gigantic parking lots ... which you don't have at Fenway Park\nIt so that's part of the time it isn't part of the charm [laughter] we're ... we're going to park we have our T favorite faces that yeah\nWe ... we just have a place which was in the fans and my father found this place and you could ... park out on the fence somewhere and he told me to go down this little street here but on this little street there and go to go to cook it right here you'll be fine you assign to want to bother you or they bother you now how can a\nPark there now but the those are the and that was like I think that only he knew the game and then everybody else\nI'm sure everybody has their own little favorite places that they are yeah and that's how you know you're a true Bostonian than me [laughter]\nWe part of the one we went to that game which is what in August I think and David Price pitched against the Houston Astros\nAnd ah we ... we lost to the same as you ... um we park at the Boston police station because my son patch girlfriend Lexie works for the Boston police she's in forensics\nSo we'd go right into this you know you have to have a a a pass to get in and all that and we park right in the Boston police ... was the coolest thing\nAnd then we just walk to vote twenty minute walk to the park from there so that was awesome though yeah that was great um ... you were telling me about when you lost it when you saw him once this year and I saw them once this year\nAnd a both losses in I think it was Nineteen eighty six I think was that when they had a really really good team\nThey broke the record for most home wins the they had the all the major league record I think for most home when uh-huh I because we lived in Boston at the time I saw them play um nine times a year and the last every time\n[laughter] so then you can't tell anymore it's just that they have to record your bad like it's not just stalling I'm sad like charmed home alone even watch tonight or don't even watch what I miss the game today\nUm I think it's at a reasonable time because I I I think they they make the poor Los Angeles ... they make them come to a five PM games I Can't\nThink of late at eight o'clock at night ... so what do you mean what you would normally expect from when he grows game I got an early ... the AP writer is I'm tired of hearing\nOh after the code harsh New England\nChris I'm tired of hearing oh after the who'd harsh New England blasted whether they do and

funny color that you're wearing some kind of a necklace\nBut then when you get out on the field you bring it up and it becomes like a who's in the face mask I better get breezy and blah blah blah blah blah I hate them\nAh I I'm I was told like if you're going to ride a bike in the winter you have to have a ball club like experts have told me that I just can't stand it I Can't just feels like so weird on me I just can't take it ... but you see all the ball players are doing that now we're in the ...\nYeah well like you said tonight we get to stay up and watch the game the whole game\nYeah that'd be good nothing but the game will both be asleep on the fourth inning now out of time\nIt was your your mother of course was she is she oh yeah\nShe's really into it among lodging it every that

well as here the executive director of the United way of Hampshire counted ah or how does this all work well\nGreat to save his biggest put twenty five hundred dollars for the United way to attract a donors who have given in the past that that maybe have not given recently any other other new donors as\nWell what's the next step for the person who has not done this for a while\nWhile the best thing this is John did well from the United way nothing to do is to be aware of this because any new time any new donors any laps donors who come back to the fold who donate at what they get to the United way will be matched by that grant provided by Greenfield savings and there's nothing that they have to do in particular they simply have to become a new donor to the United way of ... county\nRight and then anything they don't it will be that's exactly correct ... the United way itself I mean the name is out there but not everybody understands exactly what the United Way does\nExactly so the United way after county is a local organization although it has a national name and we have um local experts that really that all the grants that come into us to make sure that the giving is local we make sure that um all the money is addressing those local needs so we're very very appreciative what the bank is doing\nThe the United Way of Hampshire in Franklin County or the largest charities to which reveal savings bank donates and and what we like about it is that it is controlled as John said locally local people make the decisions on where the money goes we can't think of a better way to distribute our funds when we make donation\nMid go let's see a big brothers big sisters comes to mind the friends of children Girl Scout leadership Hampshire come to use ... hill town collaborative the people's Institute is a pretty long list here\nIt is a long list and we cover a lot of agencies\nWill debate with him for county really has three buckets that we take care of one has to do with children and youth and their families and other one has to do with economic security and the third has to do with health and safety\nAnd we look at things in a Broadway these are big issues that don't have any simple solutions and that's the reason we bringing the experts is to make sure that we're really looking at the most important issues and addressing them in a big way the thing about Hampshire county has that\nPeople don't always realize the seriousness of the issues here ... counties the third poorest county in the state of Massachusetts outside of fourteen counties it's the third porous and we'd also it's amazing isn't it so when you look at these issues you really need to be looking at it from my twenty thousand foot level and then working your way down and that's what we strive to do\nAbout just echoing on what you said about the the names on the list there again there are reflection of what the people in our community feel are important for this community and I can't emphasize enough that's\nWhy we like the United way so much during the recovery center or comes to mind and we've done a lot of shows with them that we've had them in here and then the work that they do for people that are struggling with addiction oh how did you guys hook up how to do this a partnership involve\nRepeal savings bank really I I came on board about nine months ago and I've known a couple of people who work with the bank and are they really showed a lot of interest in the work that's being done in the community from early on I Can't thank them enough for everything that they've been doing\nIt's really been a wonderful relationship that's the blossoming since um since I've been on board and we're very thankful and by we I don't just mean we had\nTo wait Hampshire county I mean we have the counting\nThe challenge part of this I mean that's an action verb swimming challenging people here a protest [laughter]\nSo you're ... you're going to have people do for that it would do when you're talking about people that have lapsed what were the reasons why people would lapse and then come back into the fold\nYeah so a lot of times the United way relies on workplace campaign so that means that we go to work places and we get the employees to give and let's say an employee changes jobs and then suddenly they may not be in the fold any longer and they may forget to give to the United way ... county and the newer place may not run a campaign\nHow long this is a huge challenge going to be going on\nTill we meet the challenge grant so my at my especially about three hours [laughter] ... there\nAre we talking to John Hyland who is the president and CEO of the green field savings bank and John did well who is the executive director for the United way of Hampshire counting the book cooked up this thing it's the twenty five hundred dollar matching challenge grant to new contributors to the ... county you indicted way so you go to the website that'd be the best way to start\nUm you can go to the website and there is a big donate button there so feel free to click on that and then you can donate straight through that if you're a work place the place that you work has the workplace campaign than get through the workplace campaign those are the two best option\nOther organizations out there that the surprise you that you haven't talked to in a while and all of a sudden they they say wait a minute we qualify for this stuff other other new people coming in\nPeople who are looking for grandma yeah definitely so one of the things that the United states Hampshire county does is make sure that when we address these larger issues that we always leave open the opportunity for new organizations to come in\nBecause the needs of the county are always changing and we need to there may be grants that people are asking for the organizations that no longer really fit what needs to be done and there may be new ones that come in so we're always cycling them through grief and saves\nMaggots really proud to be a part of this as I said before the United ways the most important and the largest recipient of the donation dollars that come from Greenville savings bank and we love the work that the United way does for our communities\nYeah and and we love the bank all we can say is thank you\nJohn Holland thanks for coming in from crucial savings bank and John did well from the United way of Hampshire Tony thank you thank you both we've got a twenty six year in our friday morning one on\nOne of our W.

celebrities yeah they are it's it's cute kind of like you guys were before you started winning this here [laughter] okay max page which All right\nSo I just want to return to is an issue we talked about a bit last week and it's a perennial issue which is affordability of\nPublic higher education and we were talking last week about this a pretty impressive op ed piece in the New York times by a senior at UMass Amherst\nTalking about um how ridiculous it is what she listens or it works in the help lines for financial aid at UMass Amherst and basically she felt like all her job was to do was to help people feel better about the same system of financial aid that is leaving families and students in debt\nThe Gazette than the road a very long editorial about this praising them\nBut I'm repeatedly stunned by the narrowness of there and many people's ideas about how to solve this problem so that goes at the end the problem is the problem is the debt or the problem is to help one well the help line was merely a symptom of a crazy system in other words they set up to help line\nThen pay students to get on the help lines and try to be a help families but there's nothing to help them with there is a way to say go go here and get a loan or talk to that person about loan forgiveness or\nRestructuring your debt in other words the uh the the options that the students could offer the help lines were miserable and she felt like mainly she was there oh this is the leader of Alan's willow Suki a student at UMass Amherst that she was mainly there\nTo soften the blow to soften the critique of the system not actually to solve the problem of high cost of college in student debt\nThe problem is essentially the amount of loans that will be\nHigh cost of college in student debt\nAnd the problem is essentially the amount of loans that will be needed for student in order to attend and graduate UMass ... is that you\nKnow um the the problem is that at one time you could go to U. mass Amherst or any public college and working minimum wage job ten hours a week and you would have no debt you would graduate with zero debt\nAnd over the past Thirty years we've gone to a point where the average student debt a UMass Amherst is thirty thousand dollars once people graduate from college and there's the biggest growth of the the most rapidly growing population is those with much more than that much higher debt than than that\nAnd so the ... that says well the cost of college needs to be slashed solutions at this is them writing\nAre multifaceted and include reexamining our tax structure increasing the minimum wage cutting administrative blow at universities and protecting students and families for predatory lenders by making a student loan bill of rights state law that's just to start\nNever did they talk about the basic idea of actually debt free public higher education like we once had meaning you either lower dramatically or you make it free for those under a certain income level which is what many of us frankly and feed them and beyond have been arguing for years\nInteresting though to stick a note where we have a visiting scholar from Brazil at UMass Amherst this year and the architecture department\nAnd and I you know I was meeting with her and say how are you adapting Howard things go which is very very well but I don't understand like everyone keeps talking here about the cost of college it's free in Brazil is I don't understand she really didn't understand this all this discussion and that's actually the way it is in many places we\nTalked on this topic we talked about this topic in earlier shows on earlier shows and we pointed to New York where this was a policy statement by Governor Cuomo has that come to fruition\nIs I don't know whether it's been implemented yet or whether it's starting up soon um but yeah that was a commitment that it would be um tuition free four students there's there are there are critiques about the the about the idea you have to commit to staying in the states for a certain number of years\nThat's et cetera but it is absolutely the right direction and what's the the the reason I highlight this cause that peace is not just to beat up on the cars that but to say that the the poverty of the debate in the state where other states are moving in the direction of debt free higher education it is not yet on the agenda but I Will promise it will be as large as\nDebasement of public education for it I I Would like to get your perspective max page on whether or not there is innovation possible here in Massachusetts through use of the Horace Mann charter schools which certainly have not heard much about in last year's but there is an entire\nOr a a\nStructure set up in Massachusetts law that innovation in charter schools\nWithin the public school system so it's all possible but that's not the kind of innovative schools that his public schools that the bakery administration support so is this horsemen charter school which I appreciate view and explain to our listeners is this a dead letter I mean it's a law so it's a letter but is it a dead letter\nNo if it exists and can be used by district the differences that the horse man charter schools as they're called\nIs our our charter schools set up within a district by the existing school committee with the existing unions in other words it's it's something that kid into what has happened for decades and decades which is the creation of\nSpecialty schools magnet schools with in many cities and towns already have and this allows for that to to happen there are some there are some kind of um limitations that we see\nIn terms of what it does to the rights of the educators there but overall\nIt's much more democratic because it takes place with in a school system has to be approved by the school committee is transparent as opposed to what we what the commonwealth charter schools have\nWhich is the only one set the charter as it gets really talk about which are semi is privatization and they they will scream when you say that but in fact every charter organization that creates a school the pioneer valley\n... you know emerging charter school they're private organizations they maybe nonprofit\nEvery charter organization that creates a school the pioneer valley ... you know it is emerging charter school they're private organizations they maybe nonprofit summer for profit but they're still private organizations that receive money from the state in order to perform this this a work of educating students\nWith no democratic oversight like a school committee like you would with a horse man style there is yes are there when was the last time there was a Horace Mann school in any school district in Massachusetts do no no there are\nThere are some I cannot the top of my head knows exactly where they are they they have not grown enormously they have not been there is not an enormous numbers of them um but there are but there are some\nDo you see any possibility of halting\nThis assault on public education in the new uh or is this a rear guard action to try to make\nA ... a diminished the damage that\nCharlie Baker is going to do with whatever's proposals are after he assumes he is re elected well\nI mean that's why we indoors chicken salads and feel like it's not at all it impossibility it's a recognized the polling shows is long shot but we felt it was important to highlight the differences and I think Jay Gonzales has done a good job of highlighting those in the debate whether that takes hold\nHer do it he doesn't have money to make the hiding well known and he still has suffered from Ike of name recognition and people don't know what his background is I think the Charlie Baker is kind of that comfortable truly can slip on and it won't hurt you to write you think\nBut listen the it's not going to be a rear guard action because in fact a lot of groups are ourselves the mass Teachers Association included are going to be leading with a very strong um campaign\nTo reinvest in public education in public higher education look the failure of the legislature passed this past July they had a chance to fix what's called the foundation budget basic way we\nAs a formula for how much money ... school districts to see that is located in the ... money from the state because as a matter or as a consequences so called tax reform in Massachusetts a limitation on our property taxes so called ... two and a half\nNow money has to go to the state and come back and that's how public education is funded in Massachusetts\nCorrect yeah the ... starting in Nineteen Ninety three after a lawsuit frankly that are union was central to dial it decreed as us called the foundation budget so that there was enough funding to provide at least an adequate education foundation every district the foundation for for a public\nEducation that formula that figures out how much should go to each town and not really been updated for twenty five years they had a chance the legislature had a chance in this quarter century anniversary to do it this past July and they failed which is really\nI think a made it even hotter issue and I expect that they will do something this spring\nUm the the issue for us is that they won't do enough that is won't invest enough to really fix the foundation budget and that some of these privatize ers in the administration and outside the administration the pioneer Institute et cetera\nAre marshal into Thai any new money to new either a accountability measures new testing or the lift on the court charter cap or new innovations zones in other words they want to um try to get their nose under the tent\nSome expat for for you and explain this to me are we talking about more money for public schools are we\nTalking about giving up the pie in in a different manner\nI Believe that there that the the failure of the legislature and now our involvement in building a campaign will lead to more funding I'm optimistic about that the problem is the range of what they could do to just satisfy\nYou know the public outcry versus what they should do is vast we could be talking the range from a hundred million dollars which I Know sounds like a lot but not with when you're talking about the entire public school system in the commonwealth\nUp to the over a billion dollars which is what we are proposing and we're proposing it because that is what a foundation budget review commission from two thousand Fifteen bipartisan commission Barbara ... former president of the MTA sat on that argued it said we are short changing our public\nSchools by lower than a billion dollars and we need to fix that max Paige

down to zero for quite a while and it's coming from time to either get a new one or just try to end this life\nAnswer the question I have is from a credit score standpoint if you're going to help me or hurt me to go hand in let's say and get another two hundred thousand dollar home equity loan but never use\nNow is it a loan or a wind because the distinction where the difference is a line you can drawn basically with like a check\nIt's aligned line and the interest rate floats so to lead to step away from the credit aspect for a second let me ask you this do you find that has been a useful financial tool for you to know that that's available in a financial emergency of some kind\nIt is although I doubt that I ever need to use it except for maybe a light and use it to make some other investments that pay a whole lot higher interest rate so that would be the only reason I might want to use it\nI liked the idea of home equity lines of credit is stand by in lieu of keeping money and things like simple savings accounts or anything like that if you have assets and you keep them invest it\nAnd if you had a sudden the financial emergency having to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful for people who\nHaving to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful for people who carry very little or no debt in their lives a home equity line of credit can be a wonderful tool as far as how it would affect your credit how long you sang in the house here in\nUh we've been there twenty eight years all the time we got another five to ten\nOkay so you're not looking to get a new mortgage or anything like that I think having a home equity line of credit is a good idea as a strategic thing then in terms of your credit history of the home equity line you have will benefit you for years to come the fact that it's been there\nThe issue potentially is available credit and ratios in terms of use of available credit and that would put the argument towards you taking out a new ... new home equity line of credit but what will it cost you to originate that he lock\nThat would replace the one that's done\nThey set a secular costs think if it won't cost you anything I'd do it okay that's what I was thinking All right we'll best to you at\n... thanks\nRebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Rebecca how are you doing\nNow Clark umpiring thank you Rebecca you're looking for new wheels\nWhere I'm now I don't know why am I bought my health a luxury model car it's a kick out of an Thirteen got I got it in September of two thousand twelve and we're going to keep it for five years\nBut kind of come and gone pretty quickly and I always get the urge for a new car I like the new bells and whistles I'm attack arsenic object Carson and I'll start thinking and we pay our callers ... ... it's just\nA lot of money to be cutting down on a car and then once we write that check it's gone except for the car you know we have the car back I'm thinking now leasing might be an option for me\nSo when you bought that car back in twenty twelve am I hearing you right you just wrote a check for it you didn't take out alone\nNow we didn't work out on\nSo it's a lifestyle choice if you're in a position that you don't need a loan for a car and you light new wheels routinely\nThat's a circumstance particularly with luxury vehicles that it may make sense for you to lease and set up by because with the luxury makes they don't like to out now discount the vehicles because they're trying to maintain a cache of brand worth\nSo with all often do is they'll factory subsidize the lease and where you get the deal on the luxury vehicle is in a lease usually for three years they want to turn you into another vehicle in a three year window\nRight and so a book cause for you\nNot a dollars and cents question is more of lifestyle question we sing on many luxury makes would be the right decision\nWell from my question if I decided to go and clearly the next time I Want a new car do I sell my car out right and then hang out with them on because I'm not your ... your spark back on the price of the car not them not the monthly payment have ... [laughter] so\nRight so harder when you when you get the deal are involved in the trade in of your existing vehicle it really comes up the works at fogs it up and it's hard for you to know what you're really paying\nAs a cost of that ... and ... says are complicated anyway so if you keep the idea of trading in your car is a separate concern here's how I like you to do it do you happen to live in a part of the country that has climax yeah\nIf you go to ... when you're in the cycle of thinking you want to lease a vehicle tarmac would give you a guaranteed price they'll buy the vehicle from you for a week\nBrought to you by none of talk Research Associates in North Hampton for over forty five years none of us has provided caregiving would love to people with disabilities none of talks I taught a family care\nTalk Research Associates in North Hampton for over forty five years none of us has provided caregiving loves to people with disabilities none of talks I taught us how many can provide support that enabled families to flourish in a together find out more at ... dot com\nDo you use home oxygen do you know about the increased risk of fires and burn no one should smoke in your home there's more oxygen in the air which makes fires burn faster and hotter furniture clothes betting and hair\nAbsorb oxygen and can catch fire more easily keep ten feet away from any flame or heat source for more information on one eight seven seven nine minute no fire\nOr go to mass dot Gov slash\nDSS breathe easy and use your home oxygen safely and\nWHM you reveal somebody you are as I age they do turn or false\nW.

I. V.\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard Joe WHM the news information and they are [noise]\nNicky with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Nikki how you doing All right how are you great\nThanks say your dad's done something for you that you're trying to figure out if it's nicer not\nYeah yeah so what do you mean the background I was going to check on my credit score during the\n... credit report and I thought it was going to get a credit card in order to boost my credit score but on the report it seems like they're the the credit card though was under the county was counting on my credit score so I wasn't sure if that meant\nI should get another credit card like my cells to boost scores that one counted as my second one\nOkay great question so you're are you an authorized user or a co owner of that account with your dad\nLeave I Am an authorized user\nRight so it depends on the scoring model an hour a credit card company would report whether that authorized users status would be a particular note for you I assume your dad's a great player and that's just good stuff for you on the report or neutral one or the other\nBut yeah yeah but you're working you're out there doing your own thing now yeah mhm I Would much rather you get your own card another card yeah\nAnd then I close the authorized users status with the card you've had with your debt\nCould that be a problem for me if ah somebody ... ... or\nYes if any if you are an authorized user and somebody doesn't pay it reflects negatively on you you don't have obligations of the debt\nBut but the ... credit Ryan fouls up your credit and I don't want you paying it in your credit report any more for your credit score\nOkay instead I'd like you to sign up for an account credit karma or credit sesame or both of them\nAnd you'll be able whenever you want to see what's going on with your credit to see a reasonable representation of your credit score every seven days for free if you want your able really to monitor what's going on with your credit\nOkay yeah so I think that that's the main credit sesame and credit karma ... and a lot of people do both completely free for both of them ...\nSo and then once you figure out what your next card is going to be are you the kind of person who pays your balance and fall every month\nOh yes I I wouldn't I wouldn't want to keep a\nRight then I Would like you to get a reward cars have some kind\nEither are there any uh any you use you would suggest\nYeah so if you uh how much do you think you charge in a month or two hours\nHow among ourselves and our you know\nAround and I know the card the city double cash city double cash to pay you to ... percent cash back on everything\nYou do it\nComing up with a different result\nSo\nYou know one of the things in life is you have to be willing to have an open mind and recognize when what your beliefs have been and what they've been said at that those beliefs can be wrong and on this one\nAt least looking at one of the largest metro areas in the country the Seattle metro area\nI'm wrong\nAnd we'll see over time if in fact you do displace employment is wages move up and up you know we've had this big push around the country for which for two is the living wage which is a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage\nAnd I I have been someone who has felt that if you want to improve people's earning power\nYou get the more skills you get the more training and you create a better position for them and the work market place\nBut it may be that it is about re allocating the pie in a way that I have never looked at and never respected as possible looking at the pie as being a fix size I've never seen that perspective and now I say with all humility\nThat maybe there is some validity to the minimum wage\nYou that may not be a big route revelation but it's been a held opinion of mine for as far back as I can remember\nJosh joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Josh\nHi Mr Gore Kerry you great thank you just plain old Clark has five [laughter] yes see what's going on Josh\nOr so back in two thousand Thirteen um I play for university football um they had me under full scholarship and during that first year or I received a back injury and\nOh I'm Sorry did it end you're playing career\nI was able to play for about two more years and then eventually I had to have surgery and then that did and so yes there\nYuk what position did you play it I think the guard the toughest you can be because people are coming for ... every single down yes there but it's all worth it [laughter]\nSo I'll let you know and I'm a junior high when I decided I didn't like getting hit\nThat was the same position I played I paid laid right off and serve guard\nI played on the left side so\nYou obviously were much better than I was that you played through high school in three years of college\nI tried my hardest though as\nWell or so from that I'm gathering something looking back five years is a hassle now\nYes sir Yes sir I'm hearing recently and two dozen Eighteen\nAnd I went to go and check my credit score on experience\nAnd before I even got to see their credit score I saw to charges that were unfamiliar for me uh again our feet I was at our whole scholarship um have letters stating that I should have been covered for tuition books ...\nSo the university should have been responsible for these medical charges that are from long ago\nYes okay\nIt and so now I have called the ah credit corporation to see what steps I can take 'em Dan so long ago and now the university has a whole\nCalled the ah credit corporation to see what steps I can take\n'em Dan so long ago are now the university has a whole new stuff so that makes it quite difficult to communicate with them um and it seems to me that they of course kind of drug defeat a little and what I gathered from ... corporation is that\nUm is even if I go ahead and just have this myself I'm it will mark the mark as paid them for for the next month but the damage to our credit score will ask for six years and all that much\nSo and you're getting close to the end of that yes\nSo um as far as you paying a bill that was never your legal responsibility I Would recommend that you not pay okay\nAnd not have any further contact with the collection agency odds are in almost every state in the country you're outside what some of the statute of limitations and you can't be sued against that\nThose unpaid medical bills and but it is an obligation to university had and even with the turnover in personnel\nI Would suggest that you make a call to the head of the alumni association or and or the head of the booster club for the football team\nYou know 'cause the ones that are involved with the booster clubs they are intense\nAnd they are very influential on a college campus and where others are are avoiding responsibility for a bill that belong to the university people in the booster clubs may be able to get the university to do what they should have done originally and should have hop to wants notified by you\nResting okay\nBut otherwise if the university just blows you off it means that when they try to hit you up for alumni contributions or they don't get those for you\nRight but is as far as the bill let the clock run cars so little time is left\nOkay All right so a question just\nJust to follow up the the actual money that is owed even after that term is up and it goes away from my credit score does that money stay on my ... you\nKnow so I remember as far as being on your head if you will once the time period is passed to be able to sue against the debt basically it's just a reputational thing which is what it is now and then that reputational thing ends at the they said six years eleven months\nAnd I've never heard that is the exact time usually out here six\nYears nine or seven but anyway it goes away\nIt doesn't mean that at some point or was it was a scavenger collector may ten Twenty years from now contact you about it but you have no obligation in any way shape or form or fashion and it can not be used in any way to harm your credit wants to seven years is run\nInteresting okay\nSo you can rest pretty easy about this because the clock doesn't have much to run okay but if you want to try to get the bill paid hit the pressure points at the university\nOkay\nInvest to you as one fellow offensive guard to another one who was good at the game and one who was not namely me\nDon's with us on the car coward show Hi dawn hey they're gone you have a question for me about credit let's see if I can be of help\nOkay so um I've got a good credit rating\nBut and and not paid off my credit card so I'm feeling great about that but I've got one more credit card that's got a pretty large balance on it and I'm trying to find a maybe a credit card\nCompany that I can transfer that get from the higher one to maybe one with a zero a PR start twelve to Eighteen nineties and giving me time to pay it off the interest charges are astronomical\nSo there are fewer of those offers right now than there were a year ago and the reason is that interest rates have risen\nAnd it's costing credit card companies more money if they stand zero percent to you\nSo what you may find here or there is zero percent transfer but they ... they often will ... interest in it within up front usually four percent of the of the balance you're transferring that they didn't give you the twelve or Eighteen months interest free\nRight yeah I've seen that and I'm willing to do that said that I can transfer the balance do you think that that's just not a good idea to\nTake no no that's a fine idea if you think you can kill off the balance in a year and a half if that's the offer then yes go for it because right now you're looking at an interest rate mid teens yeah\nYeah so have you take something from somewhere in the mid teens and you take it down to you pay the upfront I so I don't know what the actual and Putin interest rate would be but obviously a lot less than paying Fifteen Seventeen Eighteen percent\nI Would go for it as long as you down or certain you'll be able to wipe it out in the interest free period because the problem is after that period the rates tend to boomerang really high on those zero percent offers\nYeah I'm confident that I can do that but um I don't know where a lot I see ads for things all over the place so I don't know you know what's on it's what's not\nWell you have do you have a credit sesame or credit ... are both dashboard set up I don't\nSet up both of those and based on your credit profile you'll see offers available and you'll be able to see what might be there for a zero percent balance transfer\nPerfect and also if you are you a member of any credit union\nOne on\nDo you manage him [noise]\nHe ... feet to ... have you visited Hampton ...\nHappy ... southern pedestal in ... at the corner of Maine intend to speak and

TALK right now about the nation's second largest supermarket chain Kroger\nHas decided that it's getting rid of plastic bags they've already done so with one of their chains and they're going to do so if you're not familiar with the Kroger company\nOwn a ton of supermarket chains around the country do you may only realize you're in a Kroger even though it's got a different name from the private labels in the store so they're very influential player\nIn the supermarket business and they're going to get rid of all those plastic bags something that is a totally normal to some people now my daughter who lives in Los Angeles goes everywhere she goes with this little reusable bag\nThat folds inside her purse it's not that good old but it it's folds up really small and when she goes shopping she just polls that thing out and puts her purchases in it because of the fact that you have to pay\nFor bags that stores there not banned but do you have to pay for them\nAnd so she's adjusted that way you know I'm a big ... shopper and so I have in the trunk of my car I have one of those insulated bags that I take with me and do all day and I put my items and there are so I don't have to pay them for a bag\nAnd so the idea of the plastic bags going away is so much a part of the future and\nIt's one of those\nIdeas that if you are used to what you've been used to it's like\nThat's terrible that's awful but\nIt is going to be something you're going to experience is you're going to go somewhere and they're going to say well that'll be a nickel or we don't have those

should really think long and clear about whether or not you want to do business with them but the thing with the CDs\nThe federal regulators are solidly with the Wells Fargo were any bank it wants to set ugly rules on CDs that if you don't on a timely basis redeem a CD and\nThink about it for the bank if you have a five year CD and you forget about it and you don't go into the eighth year they had you see your money for three years without having to pay you anything\nAnd then they go a step further and just wipe the value clear from you and keep all the money\nThat is absolutely Clark courageous\nKeep records heat records sheep records of your own\nAnd if you use an electronic calendar and you buy CDs make sure you know when they come do\nOne of the real important reasons to make them come do is a lot of banks will do sneaky sneaky rotten terrible thing to you and if you don't notify them that you want the money from a CD they will read up it into a new CD\nTerrible interest rates so you're stuck with as well but even that is better than Wells Fargo of ... with all the money [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise] you know\nRight now five four jugs of

cute kind of like you guys were before you started winning this year [laughter]\nOkay max page which alright so I I just wanted to return\nTo is an issue we talked about a bit last week and it's a perennial issue which is affordability of\nPublic higher education and we were talking last week about\nThis a pretty impressive op ed piece in the New York times by a senior at UMass Amherst talking about um how ridiculous it is what she um listen or it works in the help line for financial aid at UMass Amherst and basically she felt like all her job was to do was\nTo help people feel better about an insane system of financial aid that is leaving families and students in debt\nThe good that then wrote a very long editorial about this praising them\nBut I'm repeatedly stunned by the narrowness of there and many people's ideas about how to solve this problem so that goes at the end the problem is the problem is that where the problem is to help one\nWell the help line was merely a symptom of a crazy system in other words they set up to help line then pay students to get on the help lines and try to\nBe a help families but there's nothing to help them with there is a way to say go go here and get a loan or talk to that person about loan forgiveness or\nRestructuring your debt in other words the uh the the options that the students could offer this help line we're minimal and she felt like mainly she was there a this is the leader of Alan's Willa Suki a student at UMass Amherst that she was mainly there\nTo soften the blow to soften the critique of the system not actually to solve the problem of high cost of college in student debt and the problem\nIs essentially the amount of loans that will be needed for student in order to attend and graduate UMass ... is\nThat the ... the the problem is that at one time you could go to U. mass Amherst or any public college\nAnd work at minimum wage job ten hours a week and you would have no debt you would graduate with zero debt and over the past Thirty years we've gone to a point where the average student debt to UMass Amherst is thirty thousand dollars when people graduate from college and there's the biggest growth the most rapidly growing population is those with\nMuch more than that much higher debt than than that\nAnd so the ... that says well the cost of college needs to be slashed solutions are this is them writing\nAre multifaceted include reexamining our tax structure increasing the minimum wage cutting administrative blow at universities and protecting students and families predatory lenders by making a student loan bill of rights state law that's just to start\nNever did they talk about the basic idea of actually debt free public higher education like we once had meaning you either lower dramatically or you make it free for those under a certain income level which is what many of us frankly and feed them and beyond had been arguing for years\nInteresting the other stick a note we we have a visiting scholar from Brazil at UMass Amherst this year and the architecture department\nAnd and I you know I was meeting with her and say how are you adapting Howard things go and she says her very well but I don't understand like everyone keeps talking here about the cost of college it's free in Brazil because I don't understand she really didn't understand this all this discussion and that's actually the way it is in many places we\nTalked on this topic we talked about the topic in earlier shows on her own your shows and we pointed to New York where this was a policy statement by Governor Cuomo has that come to fruition it\nIs I don't know whether it's been implemented yet or whether it's starting up soon um but yes that was a commitment that it would be um tuition free four students there's there are there are critiques about the ... about the idea you have to commit to staying in the state for the certain number of years\nIt's et cetera but it is absolutely and the right direction and what's the ... the reason I highlight discuss that peace is not just to beat up on the good that\nBut to say the ... the poverty of the debate in the state where other states are moving in the direction of debt free higher education it is not yet on the agenda but I Will promise that will be slugs and vice president of the math Teachers Association\nLooking to get away to

head coach Greg ... of the ...\nI'm coming and taking over a program that you know needs some change in in a way and a lot of different just on the ice is that the mental attitude and approach and just listen to some of the interviews you've done about the expectations his team should have\nYour really raising the bar here and uh so far working for grand cargo on them imagine something you really believe in\nA very much I like all our players deserve a chance to try to play the championships and you can't you can't be afraid to say it because that's why you play and I don't know anyone who's not playing for a championship so um you know we talk about that we've we've tried to make that a focus of our program is that's what we know we're here for not happy being in the league were not happy ... down in mass we're\nWe're planning when a hockey game tonight and hopefully when a championship this year and years to come so that's something that we're just trying to make sure it was a focal point in a positive way for the program\n[noise] head coach shot at a state and also a longtime assistant a coach's well at UNH particular Milly were Providence for leaving there's something right there\nTalk about two different generations of coaching has cut a lot to absorb from a big gap like that and take it into ah your your job and ...\nBut you know I couldn't work but you better guys made\nOut of the one thing that are at UNH and your new coach Milly you just really understood the locker room his\nHis dealings with our team the way he treated our players way he expected them to treat each other out of the way he treated the community around the program it was uniquely good uh and it was really a positive I think it's one of the things that people underestimate about how that drove that program I was ... war you know the winds were great but it was more of a way that the program I\nLooked at itself and carried itself and that actually came from Richie and\nUm and then what NATO was it was a great experience who is the right time of my life to go there to just um use ultra detailed he really didn't miss a missed a beat on anything that we could happen in effect a hockey game or a team\nA really good time for me to go there because I worked with were cheaper so are we kind of knew each other you know but our next ... we're going to be and so that became a little bit of a not a right but just something we were kind of assuming instead of doing 'em and when you go work for someone you've never really worked with before you really gotta sharper yourself and then it was a really good three years I really enjoyed Providence\n[noise] where was Scott or Iraq had co chair and the UMass hockey ... show when you came to North Andover besides the attitude adjustment the one who made as far as the on ice product what were maybe one of the two big things you really thought this is what I really need to take the next step up\nWell the biggest thing I wanted to do and I just players ... over the years and I saw the last few years ago a play on their heels a lot\nAnd ah you know what it is you come out to them and just defending and\nI just really wanted to get us on the front of our states you know let's let's I think sometimes when you play any user playing not to lose 'em and uh to me you know used two to one used to know and what's the difference the only difference is attendant one game is over half way through and you're probably more relaxed attitude on game you're obviously you're sweating it for the whole time but\nI just felt like you know let's go for it is where you don't get these opportunities right off one play thirty four games and sitting back and waiting for them to do something against you versus trying to force issue I just thought my personality and I I Hope it will become not are teased personality\nWhat are the things that you inherit if you're going to build a house you want to get the foundation or a
