asks readers to imagine how different the twenty sixteen election might have been if Trump's campaign had also been hacked discouraging the emails with Paul Manafort Michael Cohen Michael Flynn ... junior among other things this would've exposed correspondence about the notorious\nJune twenty sixteen Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and Trump's pay off to warn actress too into a playboy

that Manafort also how to resent a recipe [laughter] that would have been the real scandal [noise] uh yeah I mean we don't consider\nThat right all of the emails that were hacked and lead only do damage to the Democrats are and and it wasn't always just on the national level too there were a lot of state races house races\nThat were impacted by ... information um\n[noise] I I think I mean I think the whole day was in his brilliant and I and I highly recommend that if you're not familiar with the story that you look up what she found in her in her research um but but essentially yeah I mean it's\nWhen you've got leak information thinking about what's in your email or you know anybody that mail for that matter right we we put it out there and knowing that it's going to reach the person that's supposed to reach we don't expect it to reach the entire world right um and I think that if we had known\nWe love you know so little about Trump as it is and unless it's unless you don't know how to do blind copy that happened to be a long time oh but okay [laughter] um\nYou know we think about we think about what we know about from because it's being investigated versus you know what
