rogue operation yeah to fall for that\nIs really stupid and I can't believe the president would be putting that out and I can't believe that any of his followers will fall for it but yeah he always seems to see it that\nWell I mean as you tweeted any profit for Trump or his friends don't waste any concern about human rights and this is again where we keep talking about worse than Watergate worse the Nixon there are so many layers of corruption and law breaking involved in all of this aren't there\nIs so true it is so true and it every day in our face Nixon we had to wait for the tape because he didn't say publicly in this case the tweets and public statements of Donald Trump or the equivalent of the discoveries of the tape the differences the tapes\nCame all at once and shocked the nation yeah we're not shocked anymore because it happens every single state he demeaning him people he gives them insulting nicknames\nI was just going to say isn't that the other big difference between the human Nixon Nixon the tapes came out and we were shocked what he said privately Trump just called one woman horse face yesterday in another woman Pocahontas again publicly and that's just one day in our lives right\nExactly although you know he's being criticized as being affected and I would say he's just a bully yeah but he also called Marco Rubio little Marco and low energy\nJob and now so he insults men and women it's not just women so it's not not sexism is just bullying and or someone whose first lady is supposed to be\nCombating bullying I think that quite odd that he is the bully and cheap yeah so\nYeah it's I Swear a good going out\nNice weather is everything you need to know about him essentially what we learn every day about how horrible and if you saw him yesterday he's standing in the rain he's under the umbrella and his wife is standing there in the rain which\nRight next to him I mean it's just oh I didn't see I'm going to talk to them on TV you have to be on TV so we leave standing there I mean it's just oh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah yeah he is right yeah it's you know I there's a new movie out called Watergate which started out as just the history of Watergate\nBut now it just came out after I think this actual filming started maybe two years ago and now the parallels are so obvious it will be shown on the History Channel November second third and fourth just in time for people before they vote in the mid term\nTo see how obvious the parallels are and what danger we're in and why we must not just ignore bad behavior from President\nJune ... speaking of which you tweeted judge orders release of Watergate road map that could be the guide for Mueller's Russia report what does that mean\nWell there was there are two lawsuit ending asking that this document which has been totally confidential this week issued it we the day of the indictment is the day we gave this report to Congress the house judiciary\nAnd what it did was get laid out what we called the road map to impeachment by um basically indexing the evidence we did not drop include them we didn't say\nHere's the crimes they committed we just said you should look at these pieces of evidence here's some tape here some documents there's some calendar um and that's what the house judiciary use as their path to actually voting articles of impeachment young okay\nOn which she would have [noise] um which you would have been convicted had he gone to trial rather than resigning right hand um two different sets of people have asked for it to be real\nI'm convicted had he gone to trial rather than resigning right and um two different sets of people have asked for it to be released\nReleased one is Nixon's lawyer or during the um although I didn't know him I'm not sure what his involvement was apparently it represents Nixon and the other is from some historians\nWho wants to see this document not just for their historical perspective but because it shows the process that with you to bring these back forward yeah and that's why it's\nSo important and the judge has um that that certain of those documents which have been released before had been publicized before it can be released and at the archives has to review the others\nMake sure that there's nothing that can't be released and quite honestly there's nothing that can't be released and nothing national security there's no reason at all things can't be out\nOkay and um our friend knock them down to just ah just left the studio you're doing a panel with this weekend\nI'm you know I'm a happy sloppy liberal as I like to call myself but he says basically use you know our fears you know is he going to be able to fire everybody fire Mahler blah blah blah\nAnd knock them just send this stuff ... there's no way that it's not going to get out to the public he said it'll fall on you know off the off the truck in front of the New York times in Washington Post\nBy the pallet load 'em do you agree that it because I think that sometimes I wake up in the cold sweat like could they really get away with something this big\nNo no I I think and again adds in Watergate\nHad happy the document just in case I'm Glad we didn't have to face the ethical\nTo non drum we would have faced had he forced us to release them because we would have been violating grand jury secrecy and that the crime um we\nCollected them and brought them to our houses are from the trial team just in case democracy with at risk and we felt that we might need to go to jail\nIn order to protect democracy and I'm Glad we didn't have to face that I certainly didn't look forward to that outcome and I'm Glad that it turned out that we were able to get the tapes and go ahead with our case in a a a good way\nRight about that is something that certainly must be occurring\nTo smaller there is one person on his team who worked in the Watergate not it's not on our trial thing but in the Watergate office and I'm sure\nHe's aware of that and thinking through well you know it looked like a three week there's going to be an election fired back these\nThree weeks ago yesterday so ... weeks ago today yeah now Mueller and Rosenstein and sessions could all be fired yeah yeah yeah I um I\nThink we need to be prepared for that and I think the other thing is mass protests really made a difference it kept Nixon from yeah carrying out his threat to never turn over the tapes but I mean and turn them over\nRight but that's what I'm saying is at that point is not going to matter because we if we take if we take back Congress right right yeah\nRight but remember there is that time between November seventh mhm and January when the new Congress actually\nTakes over and so it's a question of what what Republicans will rise to the level of the three Republicans who went and Nixon and said\nThere you're finished we've had all the evidence you have to resign or you will be convicted who is Goldwater who is now who is Scott\nMy dad's running mates there's a reason we were supposed to meet [laughter] really [laughter] let me ask you [laughter] let me ask you quickly jumped on what Michael Cohen talking for as long as he's walking Mahler cannot be good news from Donald Trump candidate it cannot be good\nNews um I mean I have always believed that he knows a lot probably engaged in a lot of illegal activities on behalf of Donald Trump and the direction of Donald Trump\nHe's already said that he did certain things that were illegal at the request of Donald Trump though I think he will know a lot um I have recently heard that he wasn't the main fixer for Donald Trump but you don't have to be the main fix or to know enough\nYou have to do some significant damage to his credibility and to get legal status\nIf you're out here in the LA area go to politic ... dot com Julie's onto fantastic handles one of them Trump on trial with a\nAlong with a Jonathan Capehart Richard painters
