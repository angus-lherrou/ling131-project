I'm Sorry current and former you're correct yeah I mean they're throwing up their hands and saying we can't get through to him maybe a news report will it this is the intelligence community saying you're using an secured cell phones and the Chinese are listening and so we're the Russian and you need to stop and he's not stopping\nSo he he makes personal calls you and what was interesting about the New York times article and I focused on the seat Russia on the rest of the stuff on lightly\nBut what was interesting about it is how they justified China using that they pay attention to who he's calling and then they go and they find that people can influence his friends and he's calling yeah and they use them to lobby him\nSo that the opinions and the the idea is he's getting are coming from trusted friends and close because I don't think Trump actually has any friends right but the people that he believes the woman or a damn wine brain right oh right I mean who's going to pick up the phone ...\nCan I just say the F. who wants to that job if you're Russian or Chinese to have to listen to Donald Trump's bitch fest with\nSean Hannity good God awful intern job if I ever heard of a dog that's a copy boy that's a that's a high burn out job or no go ahead more you can say oh no just just the fact that they're\nThey're using it in an incredibly manipulative way let's find out who we talk do let's find out who he listens to lead then manipulate the people let's get the people close to those people to manipulate him ah so that's what they were saying they're not they're not talking about the Chinese\nAnd the Russians on par with the same amount of hiking and what they said was he trusts food and so there isn't there doesn't need to be the same level of sophistication with the Chinese that there that the Russians rather that there is with the Chinese because he trust too so they they don't have to manipulate the Chinese do they don't have to go through back channels they can just go directly\nYeah meaning it works for putting already so it's not like wrestle decent end right the other thing in that article that was that was so disconcerting was the fact that they're not\nCompletely mortified and right there in the right he's going to leak anything classified because he doesn't pay attention to his intelligence briefings and doesn't know the details sleep at night America you know yeah so he doesn't have a lot of details elite because he doesn't read it and then there's a little bit of\nFor there's a silver lining for those closed down the rest of us and them terrible told there's a silver lining for the rest of them there's only so much you can leave because he doesn't pay attention\nYeah trumps the silver linings in Trump's America really I don't know oh
