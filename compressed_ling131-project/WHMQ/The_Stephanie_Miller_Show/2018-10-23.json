they left off the Democratic candidate for secretary\nOf state oh another on on the ballot another mistake yeah coincidence what I learned\nAbout the Missouri thing is is that they recommend that you call the Republican National committee for ... for information about the snake yeah well I like that won't get you nine thousand pieces of spam over the next year\nI think there's I guess if you're like how do they even think of this stuff exact match or use it or lose it are these rules you're like what right it's like well\nI think that you know like ... like so much of the policy these days
