his brilliance suggested to their quotes when you say that that is true the brilliant but Trump suggested an armed guard could have kept the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting [laughter]\nI watch onto the results could have been far better\nKnow there are no better results for somebody walking into a synagogue with a gun and shooting people if they would have had guns there and they were protected him so they're still would have been somebody shot in a synagogue that's not right no matter how you look at all and also for the armed\nProtection if you're going in there to shoot people guess who's the first person getting shot mhm the security guards yeah because the the thing with all of the shootings is the element of surprise is not like he's outside going hand come in and\nGet ready yeah and which has always been my argument with people who say well I have a gun but the bullets or somewhere else then why do you have it for protection if the gun and the bullets are not together the gun is not going to protect you look through\n... ... that argument is always like no yeah well it's locked up okay not going to somebody coming into your house isn't going to announce it they're just getting a break you know [laughter] it's like this it's like it's not logical and same with that the element of surprise\nIs what happens and if they don't know that there is a guard there but it was going to go first on that are going to get to get at least injured on and so and and again for the injured that survived were heavily armed police officer\nSo and they already knew what was going on there was no unlimited surprised at that point they knew what was happening they walked into it yeah and and ... they think they're all going to be OK ... ah thankfully but yeah I mean they were armed so that doesn't help so an array hopping\n[laughter] you're there and watch it doesn't work anymore we know\nIt doesn't and an eleven eleven poor people are gone and one of the women was Ninety seven

it's far don't call you about I don't I don't even told her that we're faced with regards to the Mac bomber um he he's proud of law enforcement apparently though for a job\n... curtail it and he's responsible because he's got the biggest one right away case it turns as Republican same old talking points both sides do it Mm\nThing is is he goes ahead and happens to mention about Hillary Clinton saying something that will we go when they go low we go lower and he says he was she was referencing what a what a a cold and said about that if they go right\nWell you know they did that one time it took them all these years for them to come up and say something like that 'cause there were pushed into saying that\nI'm surprised that Haley checks didn't hit him with you know something when Donald Trump\nFirst got into office he started in that direction when thing in a rhetoric you guys said nothing now all of a sudden because Democrats\nSay one once or twice two times because they're pushed into it now all of a sudden they're the ones that she'd be looked at this is this is ridiculous we are getting blamed for everything or when they start talking about that we want to take away the second Amendment rights the Democrats should jump on it and say no we don't want to take away\nThe second amendment right right they started the whole lie about a bill that Dianne Feinstein put in there about the immigration that we should go\nTo open the doors completely that Democrats should not doesn't they let them carry that narrative for quite some time in the same thing with getting rid of Social Security Medicare they better start speaking out the Democratic politicians got to get on and start letting them Abbott and\nStart fighting back\nDonald is right on a but ... you know in deference to the Democrats the do hold press conferences on a daily basis especially you know when they're in session the media and Eric bowler and I'm sure would back us up on this doesn't cover it\nNo I when I go to booklets the show I'd\nBe vast majority of people you see speaking out mhm or indifferent to the president during the Republican tide ...\nI really have a concern about Democrats having the messaging capability and getting out there and being from the cameras and I and I get that were busy working and governing right when we are trying to do stuff right it's really frustrating though to see the lack of response like even last week when I'm when all this is going down with the with the bombings right or\nYou didn't see Democrats on the news you know and if you would have they probably would have been like oh look at the Democrats are pointing fingers and whining and Trump was already saying that they're ... they're being unfair to me\nOh yeah oh yeah and now he's you know to me this news\nYeah so and um because he wants me to have a startled response ah Travis just ... I Want you to have a full suddenly experience this morning so appreciate that I'm a sorties intercept yet another suspicious package address to CNN in Atlanta at this time ah so\nThey are saying they do not know if this was actually melt by talking about the war as my rusted or if this is a copycat which is\nVery possible it's a real concern right now yeah and then as we had to listen to all of it wasn't widely reported but at the defending huge office and I'm Don San Diego huh work ... right with offices right a suspicious package ... there's there's just a good luck to Dianne Feinstein field office here in Los Angeles yeah and uh\nIn Fresno my mom went out to me there's the CBS affiliate ... are both like in the same office complex okay and there was a box up there with um\nIt was described as trash but it was um aluminum shavings and I am paper soft in the box and there was no they never said what the ... the ... they never revealed put the notes that those left right in front of their office building so wow Daryl copycats happening and there can be copy cats that actually are singing real bombs this point\nAnd that training is people that actually know what they're doing ... could get something and then it's it's right now like human they're banging they're not making an advantage if they're sending it to the post office or through other delivery services then the people that are delivering these packages or that's so much risk\nWell my mom was talking about this one ... one of those machines that handle the packages\nThey just get dumped knocked around around they're not gentle and like when you ... something you should wrap it up in plastic because if it's ... oh yeah they they are not gentle they're not ... those packages they beat the crap out of those documents and they're going to the machine and if this were in the city it could very easily go off\nYeah or somebody just taking it and putting it somewhere I hold her hands on the type of device it is and it can be super super ...\nIt's not like jumps soccer's over at CNN opening the pack into it now be\nDevice it is and it can be super super ...\nIt's all Egypt soccer's over at CNN opening the ... you know be I'm not I'm not saying that he's guilty of anything it's going to make a bystander it's not going to be your dream to\nWere most likely it's not just on a it's very unlikely because even if it's hand delivered at a place like CNN it's going to the mail room yeah or to somebody's assistant I mean it's it's not getting to the somebody that high end up ... yeah somebody that high up isn't going to have this be the end delivered to them\nFor some who never going to actually make it to fill in the words of course for the Obamas or Joe Biden for that matter right\nBut but the fact of the matter is but not believing in which the person wanted those bombs delivered to these people are reading fear yes absolutely I'm In a Jewish group has told Trump to stay away from Pittsburgh you are not welcome he must fully denounce white nationalism\nAnd I agree as you would think you'd think he would by now\nBut you know use it to the names of the ...
