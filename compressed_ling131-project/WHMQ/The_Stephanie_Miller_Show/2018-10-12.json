literally is a tweet where everything him criticizing Obama for doing something like a week after a hurricane yeah in the middle of the hurricane I Love it when he talks about the hurricanes and doesn't realize that all of his uh environmental policies are causing them write write exacerbate he seems like he's bragging about\nDividing biggest one anyone as as a scene Obama had a tiny ones compared to mind that fantastic\nThan the regular tremendous hurricane where's the great joke only wants to do is everything that Obama ... you know he wants to do everything that Obama can do we want

should be dealt with capital in the ... you could also win tickets to the red Sox for next year so hot it's it's been a good time now remember\nI said I was at intimidating as if like if you go on a mass appeal I was on mass appeal yesterday a with a Danny new claim\nThing falls on a makeshift tables in the studio and the TV studio on WW all the all you got to do is find that go on to their website find that you'll see me an action you're going to be a timid ate it at all\nNo you're going to do is learn Bob style and Bob ...\nSeason insurance player he'd eat but if you give them if you give them a little under spin he just completely flummoxed by that [laughter]\nThat's right but you were ill return your service and get it over the net so nice that as a ball all those only objects distract 'em in and loud noises so start about the causes self built white uh the causes self actually\nThis is there's an urgency than increases everyday and particularly you know I was talking with Catherine about the desperate from Puerto Rico and people who\nWho or actually now in line possibly for another hurricane without an infrastructure right to do a real to uh to sustain themselves in the ... you know\nNew England is is from ... in particular this the ... rallies trying to do our part in trying to help people who are are becoming refugees due to climate change due to people and and terror and everything else and of course we have our president is not particularly helpful in that endeavor but\nThe fact that this community is a very big heart and wants to very much to be ... and acknowledge and recognize that we are a global community and we need to help people and provide people an opportunity to\nDo we know where to secure living space feels like you know so that you're you're doing your part of course I didn't do my part if I did my part I Would have doubled my uh\nMy wife beating the but jeeze [laughter] it's a thought that count as a path to counter took your time to come down here and hang out with a snake you\nIt's funny the the rhetoric that Trump will have you ... have you believe that the refugees coming in the country are here to a rape people in murder people and I don't think that this area this area that I don't a lot since I've been in since Nineteen eighty one uh this area a buy into that bill no there was no that was that\nHow much water and and it was this was a region that's actually the entire country has populated by um immigrants and refugees\nWill just is with us I mean you know we should we in fact actually we took the native peoples and turning them into the refugees are our two so you're ... we should be a little more receptive and open to the whole notion of of ... to people like\nThat and I think I think trying to rally steps up finding a rally actually use 'em while I'm bored with that\nAnd the and this was a way to do it remember you can do the good cough up fifty bucks to play maybe don't have to do that you could sponsor player if you've got a kid or something or you're great grandma and wants to play some songs you can sponsor her\nA he or she is done better you can also just show up\nShow up and put

able to do what do you may be [noise]\n\nMajorities in Congress has not lifted a finger and when we learned last week thanks to the New York times with the president was essentially part of a multigenerational criminal outfit with tax fraud is a significant part of its business model\nUm it's hard to underestimate how things are going to change right if you were able to subpoena\nTax records um protect the Mueller investigation do a real FBI investigation of someone that's going to have a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court um ... explain a lot of that what happens when we we get subpoena power\nYou're one of the best things that will happen when we flip the house is we get the gavel we could subpoena power meaning we can subpoena administration witnesses and force them to come testify publicly under oath in front of the American people\nThat's something that Republican Congress has been very reticent to do with the piano relevant documents are there is actually a specific law that allows\nThe house ways and Means Committee to get the president's tax returns\nAs though all of this is extremely important and as a side benefit while also have no more stupid
