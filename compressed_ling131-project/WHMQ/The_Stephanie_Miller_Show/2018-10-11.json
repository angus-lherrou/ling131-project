[noise] yes that would be good then I could be like we could watch more go videos you know you could hire the goats she to trim your Gratz somebody there's like a ... out there and then you hire them and then they bring goats out and the goats trim your grass\nRight let's talk about a ... obviously is a energy of investigate Russia dot org I see is\nThere's so many ... it's hard to know lick which bombshell was the most uh\nUm what do you call it a significant but Richard NATO the California computer was caught by all the special counsel's office selling selling snake online identities Russians was sentenced to six months in prison and six ... from probation um what how significant is that\n[noise] I think it's significant in the fact\nThat it's another layer of the more investigation that he is pursuing penalties for everybody who is wrapped up in this in some capacity and I think it's a reminder of how many that there are ... I think that it's\nEasy I mean the reason we created investigate Russia and the first place because it's very hard for people to keep track of all of these different threads with all the other news going on at least you have everything in one place and work it all we do\nRight so the idea is that easier losing track because there's so many other distractions that we have the latest compiled all in one place without anything else and so\nYou know that's a way to keep track of all of the other aspects of this that are going on I I think it's important to keep in mind that mole are still working even when we have all these other distractions that\nThat Miller still chugging away and that this runs deep and he's he's got his hand and all of it in terms of being able to track down all of the different threats so I think it's significant in that regard I think it sends the message that he's not letting any of this go right um and I and I think it's significant to and that\nYou know we don't know what ... guy but we know that anything that we see publicly is just scratching the surface and does it makes me feel a little bit better knowing the doubts that we don't know about\nWell and it also I just feel a little like the ... before the storm doesn't it I mean obviously the common wisdom is that he's there is not going to be any more indictments or whatever before the midterms that we're in a period you know it's\nBeen a little quiet yeah yeah I mean I think that that's a fair assessment and they have to do with the midterms coming up but like Roger stone's in trouble we know Roger Stone in trouble\nUm you know we we have an idea that there may be something like Jared Kushner or Donald Trump junior or we're gonna have to wait and see what comes down by a there's a lot cooking oh Eric princes another one to keep an eye on I mean we know that meeting in the ... the ...\nThe main selling state secrets down by the same ... [laughter] that\nSeems even more so than the Papadopoulos pickle but anyway let's move on I'm\nSeeing of or or do you have any fears this um no I was going to say the um ... speaking of Roger Stone wow\nIt seems like a new in a motion to dismiss the new law suit accusing Trump campaign scene of a legally inspiring Russian agent to December disseminates\nFrom campaign or as a part of new defense free speech uh they've already alters amendment protects campaigns right to disclose information even stolen information\nAre you sitting may yeah desperate times call for desperate measure it it's a very similar\nTo the collusion not a crime methodology that they were going for it it's ... it's like you know you did something wrong so let's see how many different we can find it it I mean it's not free speech and seven eight stolen information is out of that she got yeah how about you know we're we're innocent and didn't do it they don't they don't have that\nYeah they're going to try to weasel their way out or whatever they can I'm Jackie you know\nIt's interesting you you also a tweet and suddenly noted by my kick us researcher this morning Trump fires Rosen scene in the ... becomes the Kavanaugh probe enough of 'em\nYeah after the big fear right is that they get rid of they get rid of Rosenstein and they put somebody like ... are in charge you lose the special counsel as ... are just some people understand is currently just such as chief of staff\nAnd he's somebody not only that was discussed as the Rosen scenes replacement should he go but we just found out yesterday that at some point around that same time Trump talked him about possibly being a replacement for sessions south\nYeah so if you're just ... I mean Trump strolling your hard even though he's been traveling all along to go to your number two you got like my talking to travel and being like hey we get rid of stuff you want to take over the show and you're not going to live every day with that fear that travel that holy\nWater supplies me\nThat he does every [laughter] for over ... not owning Jodie is trying to get rid of so she can figure\nNothing would surprise me about these backstabbing bastards Jackie but let's not use sample um [noise] well you know I mean this is what what sort of so unsettling is obviously you know that he's been told don't farmers and seemed till after the midterm right and then the other thing about this all with grace period before the\nElections if I feel like the American people have a right to know like I Wish there was not any kind of pause in the more you know in most of us that that's what's happening there isn't officially I mean that was kind of a Giuliani\nMade up saying there's kind of an understanding there is a guideline with no justice department says not to interfere with an election which is why ... coming out and saying what he said about Clinton when he did was so controversial and and disturbing frankly in retrospect but\nUm there this is kind of a an unwritten rule in smaller can technically do whatever you want but I think the idea now is he bought himself a little bit more time with the midterms are approaching people know everything they're going to thirty five percent or thirty percent sticking with Trump isn't going anywhere you're not going to dissuade I mean you could\nYou could literally turning world upside down and they'd still hang on to so that's not going anywhere I think you've got your for grasses and everybody who's actively voting against him and then\nAll politics is local at this point and people are gonna gonna make their decision based on what's happening at for them locally I I Wish that there were some movement in orange county to be perfectly honest I'd like to see Devon ... theater in Aurora bacher loses seats yeah Ted Cruz can go I mean I'd love to see all of this movement\nUm but it's going to come down to getting out the vote in those communities there's\nThere's little I can tell somebody and Devon you as a district that they haven't already her they just make up their ... their decision now whether they want the integrity back in the house or they want to allow him to continue to run interference for Trump yeah I'm Jackie how significant\nIs this new report a former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe reportedly talked with the agency's boy you're after Rod Rosenstein suggested this or that they wiretap a\nPrompt the show the Washington Post saying I'm reported that on Tuesday than twenty some team capable of his lawyer that Rosenstein has discussed secretly tipping the president\nUm to see if you start to justice McCain than asked Baker how the FBI should addressed his suggestion a bigger dismissed the idea of bigger toll congressional investigators this we Rosen scenes suggesting has been presented to him as being serious\nI mean obviously some people are saying residency was making a joke\nUm what do you make of this [noise] I I think that there was some\nSerious infighting between the cave and runs you know I think the case was in love with not in love with it he adored calling me a big fan of on me as an army got fired I think ... skiing for that memo and roses felt like he was made a bit of a scapegoat it sounds like\nHe made a terrible decision to go along with that one I'm but there was some infighting and and roses seem thought in the cave should have recused himself because there was a picture of him wearing a T shirt in support of his wife's democratic run for Congress and um that ... a McCain wanted Rosen seem to recuse himself because of his role writing the\nCombing them is that she was in fighting right and the two men each one of the other ones had records and stuff and the Russia probe\nSo I don't know and and James Baker the FBI general counsel wasn't in the room when the comments were me McKay ran off and told him after the fact ah either McCain released a paging date her couldn't remember who told him um but it's important to note is as Trump allies in Congress came out and say that the FBI\nGeneral counsel so that rather than seeing the serious the bigger wasn't in the room the vigor heard about it secondhand and so it's unclear how it was categorized and ... was\nIt was legitimately like hey he made the suggestion coming from\nYou know ... generally concern or I'm a cave who was bitter and angry and had it out for ... he thought that he should be off the investigation so it's hard to tell them and if you're saying it's secondhand um and and I don't know I mean we've all been in a situation where the second and information comes from a biased so yeah\nWell I don't think I Would think you'd have to be crazy to not have discussed the twenty Fifth Amendment regard I mean that I mean I said that when all this new came out it's like I'd be concerned about somebody who didn't disgusting [laughter] if you make the same\nThat I worry about you know I'm ... it's come up and every conversation I'm sure it's it's it's some down\nHave you given those courses to how did you see this thing this morning I Love the headline Boston friends was desperate again to hang up on President I mean forty five minutes and he's talking so fast and he's rambling and he's panicked and he's like these same conspiracy theories I mean I always feel like wow it's something about to happen because yeah I I don't know what he's\nOn and I don't know what's causing the manic episodes I I didn't see the interviewer chair the interview on I'm going to have to now go back and watch it thanks for that not who I unfortunately I Am I'm sure it's the same as the rallies which I've seen too many of it's the same rambling stuff but I did notice laughing\nOr things that are on the radio on my drive somewhere and I do notice that they started using Democrat\nAs opposed to democratic the same way the president doesn't his rallies so you can tell when the when the uh the terminology is starting to echo yeah through the Fox chamber and to the president again because he likes to say Democrat and says I Know I Know\nSo listen to another uh who's the former GOP operative Breitbart guy said that he thinks the person's tax returns you know this New York times story is a bigger threat to him even than Russia and I'm like what we can do both\n[laughter] I mean when we get power back and we can see is I mean I really have always said I think he's going to resign when all of that because we could subpoena power",
