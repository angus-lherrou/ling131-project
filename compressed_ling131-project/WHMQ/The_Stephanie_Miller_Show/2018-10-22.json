kitchen said he was you know whatever they said he was pretty okay All right oh this was the thing I was trying to find\nThe story up [noise]\nToo bad at all yeah tone or wrong the video was wrong\nRight so it isn't no his ugly rhetoric isn't the problem with how Democrats respond right ugly racist rhetoric and the tone wasn't quite right you know to rank quite get it right I mean it's just\nSo ... and how do you play his stupid racist games anyway Eric right I mean that the Central Park five still guilty even after DNA evidence or exonerated them in his opinion\nOr ... after rock Obama gave his birth certificate he's still you know bright doubted it ... you know after it was with a warning releases the DNA oh well what percentage I mean you can't win\nHe's stupid racist games rice\nYou can't win and that and there were actually pieces from the press last week it simply an island boom you were in\n... during without any or introspection basically saying that for you know they're basically saying you quicker than the gutter were drawn\nBecause then it then you're being in civil uncivil and and then but just as bad as the years or so the president saying Democrats thank goodness\nThat hearing and calling a but then if they take the high road like Elizabeth Warren and sort of ... to ... they say well it doesn't work either an burger basically announcing ... is those super\n... yeah gonna outmaneuvered Democrats every time yeah and we're going to occur and by the way we know\nNow there is no path for Democrats to take him on and Tony Blair he says the ... were already declaring that that threat if he doesn't work\nYeah and then you but by the way to pick out you know perjure in a in a\nSexual assault or for the Supreme Court and you know ... ... women to get emotional and wanting to tell you their sexual assault stories they're an angry mob you know even though women like you know carrying the baby wants to talk I mean\nIt it is I I just again with the false equivalence right I mean Mitch McConnell and now says he wants to cut your Social Security Medicare and people get emotional about bad\nSide and express it ... it just is not the same as the Republican Party condoning these people banging on this door and saying look at this piece of this communist that you know at a Seventy something year old little old lady oh you're not only that lady right like the optics of all of that are just like yeah\nTypically after Trump rallies in him encouraging actual\nViolence to actual people that were there right\nYeah and then and looked at what triggers are so many uh on the right right if Elizabeth Warren ... ... ... they also all three of them don't get treated well in the press either\nI mean there there's a woman or a certain age to ... percent win for losing right I'm ... and the other three are pretty good example of it\nShe treated internal ... I have no idea what happens in November understanding context to folks who might read the trumpet forty five percent as being some sort of ... home run on the bar has moved in so many ways right but I you're right the hunted tree almost is what drives you the craziest right now\nIt's like oh he's a little more popular now he seems to be enjoying being president who cares [laughter]\nAh well I'm a yeah so there was an NBC poll or a very interesting I mean it had awful news for the Republican Party in terms of the midterm\nUh but then it did have dropped pumping up through I think it was forty five percent or something like that so I brought a lot of headlines and some of them were very strict about Bob up you know Trump now or passes although by like one or two points\nWere passer Obama mid term thousands and Obama at the same position Obama ... you're on a conference at the same position or bottle or the mid term and what ever I was leaving out was\nYes we're at the same position an Obama lot fix me through\nYour house you can read right\nThrough your house these into thousands that you're saying\nFrom being at the same spot is where the Democratic president was going to be lost sixty three point then that bind based right now it's not I mean they're basically saying costs now climbs all the way up to Obama glow point oh good for you know why it's been so bad in the cold for so long\nThat forty five percent looks amazing\nYeah I'm here I've been saying all I mean I tell you this voter suppression stuff is making me crazy I mean it is beyond anything I've ever seen I Know a lot of voting rights experts have said that I mean they they simply cannot govern they seem to just specialize in cheating at this point\nRight whether it's with Russia or the this uh uh um voter suppression stuff you wrote about Georgia right\nLike related and you know they're really started in earnest about well in a started across the country\nAre Republicans understood that demographic a man a republic yeah they understood the demographic standard where this country with having that they you know there is a world without any subtlety\nRight they're losing the battle of ideas are losing the generational the demographic battle and so they just figure they literally ... how do we just keep people from voting used to write and Brian Kemp Warren voters as much\nIn battle and so they just figure they literally about how do we just keep people from voting used to write and Brian Kemp Warren voters is much more extensive than reason to suggest he he makes he included making sure a hundred and seven thousand voters are ineligible simply because they opted not to participate in elections recently\nAs usual Eric I ask how is that legal [noise]\nHow do you just make up a rule like that that yeah\nI mean there are nine states that have worked cause you to use it or lose it so if you don't vote\nA and they might not be a record year there might be every ... you know if you do for over two or three cycles that their constitutional rights you know you don't mail back something from your elections office or if you don't all your local in the unit the Taliban and said oh by the way I think there'll be eligible\nYour boss and whatever else I mean that's all I wrote I look at like what I had no there's\nNo way somebody made a good point beyond all the other unbelievable unprecedented ... that happened to he'll rewrite when you all of it Russia wiki weeks if the FBI which also was basically connected with Russia white Comey made the decision he made because of the\nSony letter about Loretta Lynch that they planted I mean on and on and on top of it Eric she she's the first person who ran after they got the voting rights act\nSo that's the other thing is when they talk about oh black mode wasn't as enthusiastic for Hillary's they were for Obama they also were suppressed in a great deal and I think this is\nI mean almost like the most important thing\n... we turn out in such numbers that we get these levers of power back because this I mean you talked about the exact match verification process you're again what is that just a way to disproportionately impact minority voters you were saying Seventy percent of the registration is being delayed by camps officer for black voters\nI'm a sheer coincidence is of course that it's a black woman running against him right\nAnd you know and they talk about where to go back and you know lots of running back out going back governor winning back legislator across the country where Republicans that really well or over the previous backers and all the way things are\nAre you know it's going to be good you know we're going to win a ton of governor there and I were going to be a lot of legislatures flip\nAnd then we can begin to addressing the you know if you are a little recording and yeah a voter laws are up there in Rome voter caught\nMe and I think what it's meant to depress us to go oh so even if we get registered to make everybody registers we have the right id it will matter 'cause I'd been purged without even knowing it as you say because the laws are relatively new\nAnd because many voters don't know they're supposed to check in with their local election office tens of thousands of the Georgia vote may discovered they can't vote this election day\nOut and say well as a thousands that doesn't matter you know a Hillary law Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin by what Seventy thousand votes divine right and that the court you know a quick example and other people may have seen this book or a good report or what the ... newspaper last week dodge city\nThen yeah video twenty seven I got out and people it is I wouldn't be orderly Latino majority I'm a community and the entire ... ... yeah the\nAh one voting place yep light bulbs but you know what like a ... and people are going to get people are going to go\nAnd help them get to the polls air who's the thing that is that is giving me hope and and courage this morning is that you know ... you saw the money poured into North Dakota and them furiously getting IDs for the Native Americans\nAre obviously people are outraged the ACLU suing in Georgia and people fighting back in his ... says do not\nLet them you fight for your right to vote and we got to get these uh like I see all these you know levers of power back Eric and to change this because this is so fundamentally wrong you know we got to change these ridiculous rules\nAnd and people from other countries are looking at your place my God I thought America was a bottle of burgers or or democracy I thought it was even write an and you know quick on the dark an ... in the rest of the states I'm\nMost districts twelve hundred people or district that that's the norm for that I that either one or twenty seventh out people right right and then move that\nAnd now it's a if you're in the center and now they move somewhere else you've got to walk about ...\nI just keep saying let let this in range you let them make us even more determined to vote at it more determined to help other people if you can give time if you can give money if you can give manpower of your body on the ground in some of these places I mean I just think that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Stephanie Miller Show", "city": "Greenfield", "day":
