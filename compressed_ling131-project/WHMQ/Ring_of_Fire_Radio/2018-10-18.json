middle of his thesis or something and and had to check on a comments from professors or\nNothing like that no this is looking into the whole time never even raised his eyes to look at the action on the field\nSo anyway there's a lot of people like that and then there's a lot of people who don't quite get to know what's going on a baseball I mean I was always taught from the time I was a kid\nThat if you were sitting on the first base side and they are right handed batters up then you better be ready for foul balls okay you you bring your glove when you were a kid you even adult springs laws which is a good idea and it's hard to catch a ball was hit that hard\nBut uh and vice versa if you're on the third base Arkansas left handed batter up you'd better be ready for ball ball

was right under the great athlete that he is and he looked like he had the thing that wind up pretty well and who's going to make a quite a spectacular catch to Rob ... of the home run\nAnd do them or ... or somebody moved his glove return over trying to catch the thing and and and I was pretty much it looks or let's go to the phone lines that no I guess they weren't aware\nOh you were there a

years ago where it looked like the Chicago Cubs\nWho had had a a World Series drought much like the red Sox they have the curse words the gold gold yourself with a ... much like our curse of being being over the red Sox\nAnd uh they were poised to when they're on the on the play offs to get into the ... and all the U.S\nAnd they were forced to get in there and then he salutes ... um yeah the other a little a descendant of\n... who was a a boys to make the casual left field and then a guy or a cubs fan with a couple of Jack up the cubs happening was Bachmann a reaches over to try to make
