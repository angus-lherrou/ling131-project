on\nNothing ever wondered about McKay well because otherwise you would kind of neat you could turn the camera and look at the guy behind your tailgate and you're so it would be a you know maybe like spike or so what happens is when you put the car and reverse the body computer ... signal out to the camera and that's what powers the camera up at the moment the camera powers up\nSo the the one thing we always check or the one the first thing to check in my opinion\nIs to go to the camera and you're going to take a vote meter and tap into that and look to see do you have ... votes when you go into reverse when the problem happens in your case you can't really do that 'cause it's intermittent right\nCorrect so here's what we're going to use my old one Ninety four side marker ball trick the one I always talk about you have to have a mechanic wire into that twelve all the to the to the camera which should be terminal six to inquire coming out of the uh B.

the point where the tires considered safe anymore\nBut [noise] like you know that's not my only barometer tires to me are a very unique individual thing everybody you know people will come to me and say if I buy this tire\nWell how many miles like get out of it I don't know what do you do for a living you know how often you gonna rotate them what's the balance how often are the tire air how often is a tyrant pressure check there's there's a half a dozen factors that that extenders short and the life of the tire\nThen I've had cars with Michelin which I think is a good tire dry rotten two years because of environment and then I've had you know cars with some of the cheaper known name you know off the shelf tires that last you know seven years again because of environment it it's a lot of it has to do with environment\nI think when it comes time to pick a tire I think you've got to also consider the fact that where are you going to be when you need that one replacement and how easy is it going to be to get that one replacement I always encourage everybody you have to ask the question\nIs this a very new model fire that you're selling meat or is it last year's tire or two years ago model tire that's why it's so cheap\nAnd nobody seems to understand that you know if if if Michelin makes attire for whatever reason you know it's a model a and it's it's a hundred and fifty dollars and three years goes by and they're phasing it out to bring in the model bees now that a hundred and fifty dollar tier is now a hundred and twenty five people will go well save the twenty five bucks I'll buy that model be tire but\nIs that because er that model a tire is is is is that does that mean that\nTwo years later when they suffer a flat those model a tires are no longer around\nBecause they've been phased out taken over by the model bees which have a slightly different trait which don't allow you to mix and match them together tires really got to be complicated when we had all wheel drive front wheel drive\nAnd traction control whole little things that we at at the cars over the last Fifteen Years tires became a very technical involved conversation that used to be a you know there was what how many tier choices were there in the sixties was a good year Firestone Michelin\nDon lap tiger paw ... how many have you I I don't think there were six or eight tire companies in the sixties that I could think of off the top of my head that were real tire companies per se today\n[laughter] you know there there's there's so many tire companies are so many choices there's so many different styles of tires summer tires all season winter tires you know it's it's a very complicated involved involved conversation look at us we just been eight minutes talking about tires and we

charging system works bonding Arbor but I Want to upgrade their headlights uh go to an age or ... it'd be more\nUh you know give me a better light at nighttime\nAnd was calculations I'm really not close to twenty eight apps and then on top of it like to put on a set up a fog lights on it and it'll cost me over the edge to serve you Lance right\nYeah well there's a prominent yup the thirty lamps in due time but I ended up with a dead battery\nWell I don't know about a dead battery but in time I think you're going to overheat the generator and cause it to work too hard you know typically if you were going through a generator test on a six fold Volkswagen generator and don't ask me why I Know this is just things I remember from childhood\nBut you know you would see when we when we would go through the test of a disconnect the harness and then and then you know playing with doing the jump protest from the DSM the deep laws and we would see typically we would see I'm a you know we would we would we would see thirty five votes um uh you know they would they would really put out\nYou're approaching maximum average I mean where's it going to start and stop in terms of before it overheat the unit\nOr you know I'm ... and all of this is great stuff Bob\nBut you know your your redesigning it without redesigning it if you follow what I'm saying you want to put an hire you want to put in a higher draw higher intensity light you want to put an fog lights\nBut you want to stick with that original generator that the factory designed at the factory wanted it to do headlights and fog lights do you think they stay with the original generator no so you know you're\nYou're you're kind of ask yeah you're sort of asking for the impossible you're you're you're taking a gambler\nYeah well that's what I Want is your opinion about because the\nParts of among because in those situations where other people want to do this thing and I I don't think so that was designed or and you just

I Would question doing that I really would\nA guy or the other question on the other Ninety three ... ah the power one does pass such each or diagnosed just to be eight hour window or a ... which is no longer available\n[noise] I can get used ones ... are located in such a way to orderly get they get wet\nYup remember that and is there any uh\nI mean on out there that we built the stuff\nI don't know if they rebuild Volkswagen stuffed per se\nBut there was a company they're actually an advertiser a couple of years ago there probably worth looking up module masters\nAnd Modi Modi macho man I think it's modular masters dot com if I had to make it if I had to take a guess that it's been awhile ... you know whether they can do older things like that I don't know I Would say that if they can't do it there's got to be someone that's you know dealing with older\nOlder components such as that it's it's a question of\nYou know finding them and then I'm going to tell you that if you can't then you know start stockpiling that part get one or two of them and even though it's the best sport bad spot that's the that's the that's the fun of a hobby right Bob you get\nWell this is much better that so it gets better I you know I\nOnly thing where the right after ... go ahead you get\nRight right after we um put a first gear on it's the same to get better\nBut you had to you kick it up to about a after we you know force their outlet by working it back and forth twenty times without any pressure on it it seemed to get better and all you had to do with kick it up to about two hundred and ... and it would just take off and turn\nBut then when you put the wheels on the ground it wouldn't do it\nRight because you've got it and the way to the vehicle testing it testing it without weight on the system\nRight doesn't really tell you anything right so then we put another gear on right\nAnd flushed everything in which probably put a gallon and a half of flip through this thing just flushing it out just to make sure right and so basically this time after we got it out and put it underground really hard guns stared at all either way\nI just thought maybe there was something that you might know about the makings or the workings of that than lower because it's got you know like two thousand and one of them who controls the fan flood going through and the other one controls the steering assist\nAny way to coordinate ... to the diagrams we've printed off that we were able to get because you can't really find a real ... but ah\nCan you send me the Vin of this vehicle can you email me the vendors Seventeen digit then I can do that\nI'm Ron at car doctor show dot com I Swear I wasn't going to do this again but I got to do it I got I got I got I got to see this wiring diagram I don't remember I remember going back Eighteen years I just don't remember the steering having an effect going through the hydraulic one but yet throughout all of this\nThe the fan motor still has operated consistently in the same correct\nUh yes\nSo it's it's still kind of lazy and then when it turns on from heated it it blows and it stays it stays cool and it worked\nProperly right right um now after you put this last gear on and bled the year do you have power steering now no you you don't have power steering neither direction now but with the old gear you had it in one direction not the other\nRight I have to what they were the original August your share one way and it ... it wasn't a lock up all the time it was just one just every now and then but I did check for recalls on those steering years and when this vehicle was made\nWhich I Can't find them nailed date on it because somebody got rid of my label either off the door somewhere right we can't find one with a ... day there was six hundred and thirty six these units or the vehicles they recalled\nAnd the recall was for they hadn't nuts it was coming loose in the scaring gear and then just lock up when you're going down the road\nI Would think by now that's been done but the easiest way would be if you take your Vin go out to an H. T. S. A. dot Gov right and plug it in there if this vehicle has an open recall that will tell you right you know not go out to knit so now I thought\nAfter this long it probably would make any difference

I think you'll find that all the apps almost all the apps that you use in Iowa are available on Android they're\nVery you know in some cases are better or because the Android is a little bit more open and so apps are allowed to do a little bit more and that brings us to the downside of Andrew security Android now to Andrew Andrew there's no downside to you uh [laughter]\nThe downside of a Android his security um and I think if you get the Google phone security is going to be much less of an issue because Google obviously updates their phone faster than any other phone\nSo it's getting the security patches every month right away so there's an advantage to that uh I I don't think security is really a big issue even though there are ...\nYou know far more things to worry about on Android or because you're not a target if I if you were target you know of some nation state I'd worry that I wouldn't carry and I'd read from probably I'd probably carry an apple phone when you go to the hacker conventions most people don't bring an Android phone they bring their apples\nOr no phone which it or a low key a candy bar phone which probably be the best uh but I don't think a normal person is going to be at risk security wise you have\nTo be targeted I think so I think in general it's gonna be ... D sweet there is a there it is fairly easy to move from\nAn iPhone you most apps you have to re by however they don't give you credit for having on the iPhone version but most apps are free so it's it's not going to be a huge expense is there anything else that concerns you\nKnow because I've gone like full bore into the Google um their\nSystem like I use inbox on my iPhone I use the little town there instead of the apple calendar oh a guy who will photos Google Maps car has Android play and they're going to be good op auto so yeah you guys you'll\nYou'll be good or one piece of bad news and all of that Google was just continuing in bucks\nSo [laughter] I heard about that [laughter] they're happy about that what is that Google they announced this week that\nThere was well the wall Street Journal revealed that Google knew about its security flaw in a Google Plus many months ago fixed it but didn't tell anybody about it and uh apparently nobody you know was hit by it wasn't a huge law anyway but Google\nGoogle but we're going to kill go watch anyway we're done with that they put so much effort into this thing this is going to be their Facebook killer at one point Google was\nThere was so important to Google that they ... everybody in the company's bonuses on the success of Google's social effort or you go and now Google's but I you know you kind of have to admire them they got they got what they got something about they\nWere just dumping don't you go to Google Plus [noise]\nWow [noise] eight eighty eight eighty eight as we all enjoy your picks up three I think you're like it but yeah wait for the review we'll report the\nYou may know taking humane society is a great place to adopt a pet but we offer so much more for animals and the people who love them or community clinic his new England's largest say neuter provider each week we hold the vaccine a microchip clinic with affordable the we operate a pet food bank in conjunction with our community partners\nAnd one of the things that I'm not going to continue the conversation we both got in trouble but the thing is that the referees called penalties a lot early in the season you know a lot and that's what they'll do moving on last night despite everything down to nothing to one you hit a post looking for some momentum\nAnd we talk on the ... the coach cobble the second most important face off are the ones after goals and when you let up that late goal in the last minute free one you still hold out some hope\nBut to give up that second goal not last night that was a real dagger\nYeah it it sure didn't even though we killed adelies are all in the first very we took a silly family but it's down by three um maybe ... survived to one maybe you know you get over that period to want it to a different feeling you know that period three months till like good\nBut all of a sudden you're going for one it's like it's a it's just a sad feeling in the room that like how we're okay five on five or one area of the game was for 'em and and then I think the game just rode out where we tried to you know balance out some of the ice time and and give some first year our guys some opportunities um to help\nGet us back in and we just we couldn't get the next one the you know you get the next one then you and you get a chance in Iraq the two goals but didn't happened last night wasn't wasn't our night and uh who make tonight\nOne of the things that were with head coach they've spent here in the U.S hockey pregame show I'm One of the things you mentioned in your post game I found interesting you said one of the things you didn't like how your team there was finishing checks and the officers on TALK about that because\nWell I mean we've got four defense men that are um exceptional skaters as you mash says they they love to jump in the play and the easiest ways to get in front of them and the easiest way to get in front of us to finish jak when they have the park so um\nI think it's basic fundamental hockey that we weren't off all that\nBut we need to get better at we need to um you know just by just\nPut the body on them or I mean it's not just smash mouth crash running running bang but um let's make them work as make them work for the rice and let's make it a hard not comfortable for anybody that we play\nFinally speaking of ice two hundred Ninety five last night to a nearby eighty five I'm sure you're asked this I didn't see the arrest but I'm guessing you or does it make a difference in fact and\nDo you think the confines here used infield us and two hundred Ninety five will be a bigger advantage you know\nThe girl hockey guys you've all been on different ranks last night the ice did play into it somewhat um\nWe we didn't play well it's hard to say well the next time we play in a big rank it's because of the big rink we didn't play well last night in all aspects of the game\nUm but it was it the rink has to be a factor in that as soon as the other team so I'm tonight this is where we were comfortable and the ice ... ice sized um you know two hundred and eighty five is where we practice it all the things that have happened here it's the pride of the whole crowd so\nI Would expect us to be significantly better tonight\nI coach days for pre shake your time as always best luck time that's left the rest of the season that you brought as RPI head coach they've spent we come back we'll talk with us I coach Greg ... it's been about hockey for where feel\nThere's nothing better than a band that will stay in the last whistle and overtime and nothing better than eating company that does the same\nInjury energy the last whistle doesn't blow until you've gotten the service more fuel you need to keep your house warm this winter RC Andrew technicians in trucks will be there when you need a will always\nEven when the game and Ender's trouble over the injury dot com to learn more about scenery and how they will be eating you mash athletics\nAll season long and checked out the latest apparently gifts from the U.S tour with brands like Adidas under armory\nIn champions selection of boys is here as a second we're located right in the Kansas City and pick up your next maybe not always have this new worries you can also she met him in a barrel accessories and much more bone lying check it out and you got\n\nAlong you know they didn't want to [noise] a lot\nMore in winter multiple winners and his reign twenty five in the world on a laundry easy shore drive's indoor\nInternet free time you read the bank you're like you know you can't live your life you know I mean I [noise]\n[noise]\nWe're back on coaches quarter regained but if he was head coach Greg ... store frog your game day needs inside the campus at her shop online at UMass store\nDot com we've talked about this for the time we've known each other and I think it was one of your goals was to have this team based course on the ... you get be have the ... just a defined by the defense and have the defense really run the office if you will and we've got to see some of that last night for the defense been scored\nAnd saw a couple of nights backdoor plays a word goals scored a\nBy defense yeah I I have a I Believe for a while now that I'm game has changed or just\nThe defense have to be a big part of the often seem so\nWe've recruited to that and feel ah we've got it back in the strict capable of providing a lot of off into every night and like I said for the goals scored but defense in last night um [noise] you know we we again the summer even change some of the things we do to get the even more involved and I think you see a ... second goal as a\nResult of that we're we're we're trying to get to the ... his own looking for opportunities to jump to the net and that was a good example\nLast night to five on five it argue the first half of the game maybe RPI had the edge in the uh the place so this is certainly a team that you can't look past a cause the odyssey advantage she was on the powerful\n[noise] yeah I felt the same um I guess of the game went on and we've got to lead five on five maybe we we became better but it's a you know watch the game again last night and video on it became very evident uh that we didn't play very well door identity like we did much of last year\nUh we need to be much harder to play against and and that's that's the focus tonight as we addressed a lot of areas that that we weren't very hard to play against last night and then and they played in you know they compete at art and fortunately we are now a team that can win in multiple ways but I Want to win by being a teen networks arteries night\nOne of the things that don't and I talk about on there a lot is the most important face off as the one after a goal and\nUh of course the other thing we talk about you as a coach due to his those lake or so and the first period you make it three to one which is critical but the ... when the face off immediately after the three one goal have kale have that a tremendous rush a that was a real bag or on to their heart even in the first parents\nYeah and that at that had been you know to go up four goals and a period is\nIn the game let alone period is a you know it's quite a bit so I think a deflated them it's probably um I think it kind of put the game out of reach and or the rest of the game has gotten and and\nUm you know those those are in those goals are important late in the periods and I'm I'm a good job by us are good for for ten minutes of game on and off with scorn chance by the end is very weird for ball so it's on\nOne of the things that are I noticed right off the bat on one of your penalty ... seems like this is a totally different teams down was dictated by the opposition but it looks like very aggressive on the penalty kill each time you had the ...\nThere was no looks to the bench and dumped then you look like you were looking for scoring chances to one two three on to whatever it was not the case well\nWe don't really um structure anything outside of the defense's own but I just think our guys doing a good job of\nSeeing opportunities to jump think we've pressure pretty well high in that zone and created to turn over China's on which allowed us to jump out of his own with a with numbers and so there are guys and all that they've got a diamond space that they've got the green light to try to\nBe offensive and Nick plays and I'm decay we had a fair number of Russia's and you know try to create some stuff offensively which are which is a nice ah to add to your arsenal\nGot to see last night while you have a lot of why you have a lot of respect for Jake approach or what a tremendous ... had looks like a real leader on the U.S\n[noise] yeah it's a bit deceiving a you only get three points and everybody thinks he had a great game and coach thinks he was just okay you know he's he's learning\nHe's a he's a free flow hockey player the scores 'cause he's just [noise] it is for um [noise] I Need them to play our systems a little better um these kind of the rogue he's out there Going Rogue which the average fan you don't see the things that he's should be doing\nYou just kind of disappears at times when he's supposed to be falling part of our structure so I Know all the good things we can do um and we're just working to catch him up to speed either what you just like a freshman here just you know after you use the what we what we want to do in our systems\nLike all of that on the uh you know last night so we corrected on that finally I coach to Michael make the call as far as ... as he's still in charge of doing that and that so whether it's you or him\nWhat's uh the thought process and not do you want to try to find this number one guy as soon as possible or and they don't play the game last night and the turnover really build you out in a lot of occasions\nYeah we went in to the weekend with a bus just play the first night and see what happens and you\nKnow Matt played well we as happy the way played and\nUh we just felt like this has to be a good game to fill the play his dad's actually from Finland and then um you know amount of good first game and Ohio State next week and he plays well probably get the second game too just because we don't know affiliates so we got to get him some games are it
